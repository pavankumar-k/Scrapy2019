Contact lens discomfort (CLD) is also a common cause for cessation of lens wear, and accordingly not only a struggle for patients, but also care providers, researchers, and lens manufacturers.  This talk will discuss factors related to (1) the contact lens material and overall design, (2) the ocular surface, and (3) attributes and characteristics other than the contact lens and ocular surface which impact patient-reported CLD.  Updates on new research, as well as treatments, and possible future directions will be provided.", "details": "\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n
