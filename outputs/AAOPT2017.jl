Participants will learn about databases, journal article access, find out about alerting services, find Evidenced BasedPractice Guidelines, find online books and other web resources available to them either both freely available and or by individual subscription, and will be able to select key information resources from a rapidly-changing information landscape.  Additionally, collaborative research networking, organizational and information gathering tools such as Mendeley will be reviewed. Participants will be asked to bring a smartphone or tablet that is wifi enabled, so they can access the resources while in the workshop and be able to ask questions about the demonstrated resources they are logging on to. Participants will leave the workshop with a list of resources and knowledge that there are reliable resources to use when searching for professional information online and that many high-quality tools are available freely or by individual subscription. Workshop will include a PowerPoint presentation, a handout and interactive experiences which participants can take with them to utilize in their daily practice.

{"_type":"dict","author":"Naureen Haroon","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/pellet-gun-injuries-in-the-kashmir-valley","text":"Abstract\n\nBackground:\nPellet guns are often used for hunting wildlife in Western countries. Each cartridge carries between 300 to 600 lead-based pellets; all released upon fire. In Kashmir, they are used by Indian army forces on people to stop protesters. Pellets easily penetrate the skin’s soft tissue and cause permanent damage to internal organs. When used within 5 meters, the mortality rate in humans is 85-90%. At more than 50 meters, a pellet gun can blind a person.\n\nCase Report:\n\nCase 1:\nA 24 year old AM presented with BCVA 20/800 OD and NLP OS after pellet gun trauma. CT and X-ray revealed pellets scattered throughout skull and facial bones. A 3.5 x 3.9 mm foreign body appeared in right orbit. OS was auto-eviscerated during trauma. Patient underwent: PPV, endolaser, silicone oil injection, PPL and foreign body removal OD. At 6 month visit, OD revealed fixed irregular pupil. Fundus evaluation revealed pale nerve and partially attached macula under oil. OS lids had self-sealed. Patient was referred to low vision services and to an ocularist for prosthesis OS.\n\nCase 2:\nA 28 year old AM presented with pellet gun trauma OS with BCVA 20/20 OD and LP OS. Evaluation OS revealed paracentral corneal laceration, partial hyphema, and traumatic cataract. IOP was 35 mmHg.  Further evaluations and CT revealed multiple metallic pellets in the left globe and head and a retinal detachment. Patient was referred for same day retinal services. He underwent cataract removal, PPV and endolaser OS. At 6 month visit DFE reveals attached retina and healthy optic nerve OS. Patient remains aphakic due to uncontrolled IOP OS with medications.\n\nDiscussion:\nUse of pellet guns are a public health issue and a human rights violation.

A public health policy needs to be implemented to end use of pellet guns on humans.","title":"Pellet Gun Injuries in the Kashmir Valley","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175433\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study is to determine attitudes and training received by educators to detect visual impairments in children and understanding the importance of vision screenings and eye care.\n\nMethods:\nA 9 question IRB approved survey was sent to teachers to explore their current training, ability to detect visual defects, interest in learning how to detect visual impairments, and understanding of the link between untreated visual impairments, learning problems, and behavioral issues. The survey was sent to four different public elementary schools in three states: Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York.\n\nResults:\n48 surveys were completed. The majority of teachers were willing to participate in additional training and 93% of the teachers believed there is a benefit for teachers training to identify visual impairments. One teacher had formal training to identify visual impairments. 50% were familiar with amblyopia and astigmatism while one teacher was familiar with hyperopia, 13% with myopia, and 28% were unfamiliar with any of the visual impairments that were listed. 87% of teachers believed there is a link between visual impairments and behavioral issues and 70% had a student who had an academic or behavioral issue that was directly related to a visual problem.\n\nConclusion(s):\nWe concluded that the most effective way to detect visual problems in students is to implement a training system for teachers. Teachers spend a high percentage of the time observing their students in a learning environment, making them best suited to detect visual problems and make the necessary referral.","title":"Screening for Visual Impairments in Children: Educating Teachers and School Nurses to Screen for Visual Impairments","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175434\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Alex Hentschel, Alex Shin, Nikolas Moore, Aaron Lewis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New England College of Optometry, New England College of Optometry, New England College of Optometry, New England College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

In the brain, it can produce single or multiple ring enhancing lesions as presented in this case.\n\nCase Report:\nA 46-year-old Hispanic male presented with complaints of blurred vision with progressive bilateral worsening of one week duration. The patient denied a history of ocular trauma, diplopia, flashes/floaters, cat scratches, unusual headaches or pulsatile tinnitus. Systemic history was positive for type II diabetes and hypertension of unknown duration and is currently not on medications. The patient was afebrile and demonstrated mild right-sided ataxia upon ambulation. Visual acuity uncorrected was light perception OD and 20/80 OS. Pinhole and manifest refraction did not improve vision. Blood pressure was 145/97 right arm sitting with a pulse of 118. Pupils revealed a positive one log unit RAPD OD. EOMs were full without pain upon excursions OU. IOP was 17/17 mmHg. Anterior segment findings were noncontributory. Dilated fundus examination revealed asymmetric bilateral choked disks with neuroretinitis right eye and a “Roth” spot temporal to left optic nerve. The patient was referred immediately for evaluation and MRI imaging which revealed ring enhancing lesions throughout the brain and a left perihilar disseminated lesion. A right frontal cranial burr hole allowed egress for aspiration and removal of abscessed brain tissue.\n\nThis case is of interest as Actinomyces is an ancient organism which presents rarely in the general population but must receive prompt treatment to decrease the risk of significant morbidity or mortality.\n\nConclusion(s):\nActinomyces should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with bilateral choked disks especially in cases with associated neuroretinitis.","title":"Neuroretinitis Associated with Actinomyces Lesions of the Brain and Lung","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175435\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Department of Veteran Affairs\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study aims to assess the impact of an awareness tool for safe and responsible driving (OSCAR) on seniors’ (1) interest, openness and knowledge of safe driving; (2) awareness of changes in their driving abilities; and (3) use of compensatory strategies.\n\nMethods:\nA preexperimental design, with pretest (T\n0\n) and posttest (T\n1\n), was used with 30 experimented drivers, aged 60 to 77 years and presenting good visual acuities with their habitual corrections. At T\n0\n, participants were asked to answer three questionnaires: 1) Interest, Openness and Knowledge (IOK), 2) Changes Occurred in driving Abilities (COA) and 3) Utilization of Compensatory Strategies (UCS). Afterwards, the participants received an intervention about safe and responsible driving; OSCAR was read and commented by a research assistant. A copy of OSCAR was given to all participants for them to consult at home. Eight weeks after the intervention (T\n1\n), the participants responded again to the same questionnaires (IOK, COA and UCS). The scores before (T\n0\n) and after (T\n1\n) the intervention were compared with paired\nt\ntests and the effect sizes were calculated.\n\nResults:\nOverall, the results show a positive impact of OSCAR on senior drivers. There was a statistically significant improvement in mean scores for all questionnaires (IOK, COA and UCS) (\np\n≤.001) and important effect sizes were observed (\nd\n>0.8).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis study demonstrate that OSCAR can increase knowledge about safe driving and awareness of the limits of driving for seniors as well as enhance use of compensatory strategies. Given that the number of senior drivers is constantly increasing, such awareness interventions could play a major role for safety of public road users. Further research should assess the impact of OSCAR on persons whose deficits are due to pathological aging.","title":"Awareness Intervention in Seniors for Safe and Responsible Driving","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175425\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Marie-Julie Rivest, Mélanie Levasseur, Jocelyn Faubert, Judith Renaud\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Institut Nazareth et Louis-Braille, School of Rehabilitation Université de Sherbrooke, School of Optometry Université de Montréal, School of Optometry Université de Montréal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Ethan Wyles","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/infection-control-should-keyboards-in-eye-care-facilities-be-regularly-cleaned","text":"Abstract\n\nPurpose:\nComputer keyboards commonly used in eye care settings are rarely regularly cleaned. The risks associated with this have not been previously studied. This study investigated the need to include keyboards in infection control protocols by verifying the presence of microorganisms on keyboards. Additionally, the efficacy of cleaning with a commercial germicidal cloth was evaluated.\n\nMethods:\nIn a facility that does not regularly clean keyboards, swabs of the F key in 12 primary care exam rooms were cultured onto 5% sheep’s blood agar plates using a technique to allow for single colony growth. Subsequently, the keyboards were wiped once in each direction with the germicidal cloth. After 10 minutes, the J key was swabbed and cultured using the same technique. The agar plates were incubated at 37°C. Colonies were counted at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Data were analyzed using a paired t-test.\n\nResults:\nAnalysis of the 72 hour data showed the mean number of colonies and SD was 42.50 ± 52.71 before cleaning, and 3.33 ± 9.71 after cleaning. There was a significant difference in the 72 hour data when comparing cleaned to uncleaned keyboards (p = 0.0136).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis pilot study suggests that keyboards in eye care settings that are not cleaned harbor microorganisms which could be a source of infection. It also implies keyboards should be included in infection control protocols and perhaps handwashing frequency be increased when keyboards are used during patient care. The study’s limitations are that only 12 keyboards were evaluated and microorganisms were not identified. However, these results have prompted further evaluation of keyboards within the studied facility. A follow-up study will include multiple clinical services and microorganism identification to better assess the risks of infection. Moreover, infection control and handwashing protocols are being revised in the studied facility to limit patient exposure to pathogens found on computer keyboards.","title":"Infection Control: Should Keyboards in Eye Care Facilities be Regularly Cleaned?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175426\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Elizabeth Wyles\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Once opened, pharmaceutical companies recommend discarding ophthalmic drugs after 28 days. However, this recommendation applies to patients who self-administrate their prescribed eye drops in a home setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preservation period and the efficacy of ophthalmic preparations, such as Alcaine®, Mydriacyl®, Mydfrin® and Cyclogyl® in a clinical and controlled setting.\n\nMethods:\n38 primary eye care students were recruited to participate in the study. They used 25 bottles of each diagnostic drop at the “Clinique Universitaire de la Vision” for a 7-month period. An analysis of the bacterial contamination was repeated ten times using both an agar plate and a nutrient broth, at time 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks and 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 months. The anesthetic (Alcaine®), mydriatic (Mydriacyl®, Mydfrin®) and cycloplegic (Cyclogyl®) effects were tested after seven months of use and compared to non-opened ophthalmic bottles.\n\nResult\ns:\nDuring this period, 4971 drops of Alcaine®, 3219 drops of Mydriacyl® and Mydfrin® and 1896 drops of Cyclogyl® were administered to patients. Contact between bottles and biological tissues were reported 80 times for Alcaine®, 53 times for Mydriacyl®, 38 times for Mydfrin® and 52 times for Cyclogyl®. Following the 10 inoculation sessions on the agar medium at the predetermined times, no bacterial and fungus contamination was noted.

CAM use has been measured in other populations, but not in patients attending routine eye examinations. This study investigated CAM use of patients seen at the UNSW Optometry Clinic including categories of CAM used, potential associated factors and the accuracy of recording.\n\nMethods:\nPatients seen at the UNSW Optometry Clinic between January 2013 and August 2016 were invited to complete an online survey. A sub-set of patients seen between March 2016 and August 2016 were asked provide identifying details so that survey responses could be compared to clinical records. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and factors associated with CAM use investigated using Chi-Square analysis.\n\nResults:\nResponses were received from 266 (6%) patients. The estimated prevalence of CAM use was 71% (95% CI: 65 - 76%). The most common category of CAM used was natural products 52% (CI 46 - 58%), followed by mind-body medicine 35% (CI 30 - 41%), manipulative and body-based practices 37% (CI 31 - 42%) and other 11% (CI 7.7 - 15%). 64% used more than one category of CAM. Females, private health insurance, belief in the efficacy of CAM, and consulting with CAM providers were associated with CAM use (p < 0.05). Records of 43 patients were compared with survey responses. There was under-reporting and/or under-recording of CAM use compared to self-reporting; the disagreement was high at 64% (CI 45 - 78%).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe self-reported prevalence of CAM use in an Australian optometry clinic population was high at 71%. CAM use was severely under-reported / under-recorded in patient records and more research is required to determine the factors involved. This under-reporting / under-recording may have implications when considering conventional therapies.","title":"Complementary and Alternate Medicine Use in an Australian Optometric Practice","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175430\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Univ. of New South Wales School of Optometry and VIsion Scie\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kathleen Watt, Isabelle Jalbert, Blanka Golebiowski, Jolene Fong, Hamina Arif\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of New South Wales Sydney Australia, University of New South Wales Sydney Australia, University of New South Wales Sydney Australia, UNSW Sydney Australia, UNSWSydney Australia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Identifying these vision problems early could eliminate a potential barrier to learning for these students. The Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) states that a child being evaluated for a disability be assessed in all areas related to the suspected disability, including, if appropriate, health, vision, hearing, social and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance, communicative status, and motor abilities. The purpose of this project is to look at vision care policies in the United States for students entering special education programs.\n\nMethods:\nInformation on current requirements for vision evaluations of special needs students was collected for the 50 United States and the District of Columbia in the spring of 2017 via internet searches and phone calls. The data was compiled and compared among each state.\n\nResults:\nCurrently, 28 states follow the IDEA recommendations of a vision screening, if appropriate for students entering the special education system. Ohio is the only state requiring a vision examination for all students entering a special education program, while Minnesota and Rhode Island recommend a vision exam, if appropriate. 12 states require a vision screening for students entering special education. No vision evaluation for special education students are required in 8 states. There is currently no standard battery of tests used for vision screenings among the United States. Some are more extensive, while others may simply measure distance visual acuity.\n\nConclusion(s):\nAlthough many policies on vision screenings and entry to school vision exams have been put in place in the last decade, special education students may not be receiving the vision services that they need. Networks of stakeholders need to continue to advocate for this population of children, ensuring they receive appropriate vision services.","title":"State Vision Requirements for Students Entering Special Education Programs","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175432\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University-Chicago College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Dena Weitzman\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Chicago College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

We compiled the information from these interviews and additional literature research into a pamphlet outlining exam preparation, adaptive diagnostic techniques, and overall exam philosophy. To test the effectiveness of the pamphlet we surveyed optometrists via an online questionnaire, collecting their demographic information, as well as their comfort levels before and after reading the pamphlet, and asked them to rate the usefulness of the information provided.\n\nResults:\nWe compared the comfort levels before and after reading the pamphlet of optometrists whose practice/clinic does treat patients with ASD (n = 50) and those whose practice/clinic doesn’t treat patients with ASD (n = 15). In both cases, optometrists’ comfort levels had a statistically significant (T-Test, p = 0.002, p = 0.007, respectively) increase after reading the pamphlet. All the optometrists surveyed (n = 65) rated the overall usefulness of the pamphlet with an average value of 8.6/10.\n\nConclusion(s):\nWith this pamphlet, we hope to address the limited quality of care for patients with ASD by educating optometrists about exam preparation and adaptive techniques. The exam philosophies provided in the pamphlet aim to create an environment that is conducive to performing a successful eye exam. The results showed that our pamphlet improved optometrists’ comfort levels in treating patients with ASD, and they found the information provided in the pamphlet to be useful.

A baseline vision impairment study in the Ashanti region is necessary to effectively plan for refractive services and blindness prevention strategies.\n\nMethods:\nA cross-sectional study using multistage cluster sampling was conducted in 24 communities in Ashanti region, Ghana. A total of 1420 participants aged 18 years and above were enumerated using a modified Rapid Assessment of Vision Impairment (RAVI) protocol. This was limited to unaided visual acuity (VA) using a Snellen chart at a distance of 6 meters, near binocular visual acuity and direct ophthalmoscopy for all participants after obtaining an informed consent. The VA was repeated using a pinhole for participants with VA ≤ 6/12. A non-cycloplegic refraction was done for those whose pinhole VA improved.

{"_type":"dict","author":"Devany Dougherty","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/microbial-contamination-of-contact-lens-solutions-preservative-free-artificial-tears-and-ophthalmic-drugs","text":"Abstract\n\nPurpose:\nMicrobial contamination in contact lens solutions, preservative free artificial tears, and ophthalmic drugs is a major concern since it can potentially lead to eye infections. Eye doctors recommend appropriate handling of solutions to prevent microbial growth. Similarly, ophthalmic drugs, either self- administered or administered in a clinical setting, have to be handled using sterile techniques and discarded within the recommended time. The aim of this study is to examine different ophthalmic solutions for microbial contamination after a period of use.\n\nMethods:\nVarious multipurpose contact lens solutions including: Renu Fresh, Opti-Free Puremoist, Equate, Clear Comfort, Moisture Balance Advanced, Blink Revitalens, and Biotrue were assessed for contamination after 30 days of daily use. The solutions were then plated on blood agar plates and incubated at 37o C for three days. A similar procedure was followed for the three different ophthalmic drugs: Fluress, Phenylephrine, and Tropicamide and a preservative free artificial tear (Systane, exposure time of one, two, and three days). The number of colony-forming units (CFUs) on the blood agar plates was used to assess microbial growth in the various test solutions.\n\nResults:\nAmong the contact lens solutions tested, Equate and Renu Fresh were found to be more prone to microbial growth. Fluress developed colony-forming units also. As expected, Systane showed evidence of microbial growth but not until after two days of exposure.\n\nConclusion(s):\nMicrobial growth observed in the solutions indicates that their unique chemical composition may make them more prone to contamination. The use of an effective preservative along with adherence to appropriate handling of these solutions is important to maintain long-term sterility. In addition, discard requirements for ophthalmic drugs, such as Fluress, may need to be adjusted.","title":"Microbial Contamination of Contact Lens Solutions, Preservative Free Artificial Tears, and Ophthalmic Drugs","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175424\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Cassondra Lux- O'Callaghan, Dominic Rentz, Michael Rosner, Vinay Nagaraj, Balamurali Vasudevan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Midwestern University, Midwestern University, Midwestern University, Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and repeatability of crystalline lens grading in the presence of a small-aperture corneal inlay.\n\nMethods:\nIn a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial, 507 emmetropic presbyopes (45 to 60 years of age) were implanted with a small-aperture inlay in a stromal pocket created by femtosecond laser. In the trial, lens opacification was graded pre- and post-operatively as being clear, 1+ opacity, 2+ opacity, 3+ opacity, and 4+ opacity. A grading of “Other” was used to describe opacities not included in the grading scale (e.g., trace opacity, dots, etc., that indicated less than 1+ opacity). The reliability and repeatability of this grading method with and without the small-aperture inlay in place was assessed by comparing preoperative to postoperative crystalline lens grading at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12.\n\nResults:\nPostoperative crystalline lens grading did not change from preoperative for nearly all subjects, ranging from 94.4 to 96.0% agreement across postoperative time points. For up to 6% of subjects, postoperative lens grading changed by one level of opacity from the preoperative grade. Grading also remained unchanged between consecutive postoperative visits, ranging from 97.2 to 99.8% of subjects at different postoperative visits.\n\nConclusion(s):\nLens grading within the 1.6 mm aperture is the most critical to monitor in subjects implanted with the small-aperture corneal inlay. The results from this study show that crystalline lens grading is not impeded by the presence of the KAMRA inlay, and qualitative assessments are reliable and repeatable after the implantation.","title":"Repeatability of Crystalline Lens Grading Before and After Implantation with a Small-Aperture Corneal Inlay","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175414\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Clinical Research Consultant\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Srividhya Vilupuru, Ling Lin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        AcuFocus Inc., AcuFocus Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Hyperopia was excluded from the study. The mean age of patients was 29 years (range: 21-42). 72% of the patients were male. Standard clinical tests included visual acuity (ETDRS: Precision Vision, IL), manifest refraction, 5% low contrast acuity (Precision Vision, IL), wavefront measurements, and corneal topography. The QCSF was used to measure monocular (right eye) CSF at photopic (85 cd/m\n2\n) and mesopic levels. Mesopic testing was conducted by wearing a pair of 2.0ND filter google. CSF measured pre-operatively (best-corrected spectacle) was served as a baseline (BL). Post-operative CSF (uncorrected) was tested at 1, 2, 4, and 13-wk after the surgery.\n\nResults:\nCSF during the recovery were significant different between LASIK and PRK (p=0.000). CSF of the LASIK eyes returned to the BL at 1-wk post-surgery under photopic condition; but there’s a small, clinically insignificant reduction in mesopic CSF during the 13-wk period. At 1-week post-PRK, nearly 40% of the contrast sensitivity loss can be explained by optical aberrations (uncorrected refractive errors). CSF started to recover at 2-wk and almost reached to the LASIK level by 4-wk post-surgery. By 13-wk post-surgery, both photopic and mesopic CSF of the two groups were identical. CSF acuity measured by the QCSF was significantly correlated to the high contrast visual acuity and the 5% low contrast acuity (p<0.01).\n\nConclusion:\nQCSF is a sensitive method in detecting functional visual changes during the recovery after refractive surgery.","title":"Effects on Contrast Sensitivity Function Following LASIK & PRK","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175416\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Naval Medical Center San Diego\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sandor Kaupp, Neil Delallana, Myah Mirzaoff, Donna Murdoch\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Naval Medical Center San Diego, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Naval Medical Center San Diego\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The prevalence of this complication is considerably low ( < 1%), but its consequences have warranted studies to determine the pre-operative risks. The Ectasia Risk Score System (ERSS) is a risk factor model that predicts the risk of post-refractive surgery ectasia.\n\nCase Report:\nA 37 year old male presented to Woolfson Eye Institute with complaints of decreased vision in his left eye. He disclosed a history of LASIK surgery at another refractive surgery facility nine months prior. Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD, counting fingers OS. Slit lamp examination revealed a superior hinged LASIK flap OD, and a superior hinged LASIK flap with central corneal scarring and thinning OS. Topography findings revealed signs of a myopic LASIK treatment ablation OD, and severe inferior steepening OS. The patient's pre-operative tomography results revealed inferior corneal steepening in both eyes. The ERSS was used to evaluate LASIK candidacy based on the pre-operative information provided.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe patient's pre-operative findings suggest possible sub-clinical corneal ectatic disease. According to the ERSS, the patient was a moderate risk for post-LASIK ectasia in the right eye, and a high risk for post-LASIK ectasia in the left eye. The patient was diagnosed with post-LASIK ectasia OS. Due to abnormally thin corneal pachymetry results, the patient was denied as a corneal cross linking candidate. The patient was advised that a penetrating keratoplasy in the left eye would be the best option if visual acuity was not adequate with specialty contact lens correction.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe ERSS is an essential tool that can be used to predict the risk of post-LASIK ectasia, and identify sub-clinical corneal ectatic diseases.

This was part of the Spectacle Compliance among School Children in Nigeria Study.\n\nMethods:\nThis cross sectional study involved vision assessments to determine the prevalence of vision impairment and significant refractive error in school going children. Children who failed the vision screening (VA <6/9 in either eye), were examined under cycloplegia. Cycloplegic refraction findings were obtained using one drop of 1% cyclopentolate and one drop of 1% tropicamide instilled two times at 5 minutes interval, and refraction performed using NIDEK autorefractor followed by subjective refraction. Significant refractive error was defined as myopia > - 0.50DS, hyperopia > + 1.50DS and astigmatism > - 0.50DC.\n\nResults:\nFour thousand and one lower and upper secondary school children (aged 9 to 16 years) from 11 schools were screened. Nine schools were from semi-urban areas, while one school was located in a rural area. There were 3.7 times more children who were 12 years and older compared to 6 to 11 years old in the same sample. In terms of gender, the ratio of boys to girls was almost the same (ratio 1: 0.84). There was no statistical significance between age groups and between genders (p = 0.353 and p = 0.822, respectively). The prevalence of vision impairment and significant refractive error was 11.0% and 5.7%, respectively. The prevalence of myopia was 3.0% (95%CI 2.5% - 3.6%) and was marginally more than the prevalence of hyperopia 2.7% (95%CI 2.2% - 3.2%). Only 4% of the children with significant refractive errors presented with spectacles.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe study found high number of children with vision impairment and refractive error. Intervention will be needed to identify and treat the children timely. The identified children with refractive error were prescribed with spectacles and were included in the spectacle compliance study which findings will be reported separately.","title":"The Prevalence of Vision Impairment and Uncorrected Refractive Error among School Children in Calabar, Nigeria","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175421\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Brien Holden Vision Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ving Chan, Hasan Minto, Kovin Naidoo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Brien Holden Vision Institute, Brien Holden Vision Institute, Brien Holden Vision Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This could be due to the method of refraction, end point of subjective refraction, pupil size at scotopic or photopic light levels, etc. An i.Scription refines the traditional manifest subjective refraction based on ocular aberrations obtained from the Zeiss i.Profilerplus. The aim of this study was to investigate any differences between habitual and i.Scription refractions and their relationship to night vision complaints.\n\nMethods:\nHabitual, manifest, and i.Scription refractions were obtained from both eyes. Low and high order aberrations of the subjects were recorded with the Zeiss i.Profilerplus. Root mean square (RMS) ocular aberration measurements were obtained at small (3mm) and maximum pupil sizes. Subjects also rated their difficulty with driving at night on a scale of 1-10.\n\nResults:\nFor the spherical and cylindrical comparison, the habitual and i.Scription difference was significant [(t=-3.12, p < 0.01), (t=5.39, p < 0.01)]  as was the subjective and i.Scription comparison [(t=-2.31, p=0.03), (t=-2.54, p=0.02)], respectively. There was no significant difference for the spherical equivalent. A strong correlation was noted between the spherical equivalent i.Scription refraction and low-order RMS ocular aberration values for the 3mm (p<0.01, r=-0.72) and maximum (p=0.01, r=-0.57) pupil sizes. The maximum pupil size measured in the i.Profiler\nplus\ninstrument was 4.84 ± 1.04 mm. Based on a subjective questionnaire, 10 out of the 19 subjects had discomfort at night with a mean (SD) magnitude of 4(2.7).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThere was a significant difference found between the habitual and i.scription as well as between the subjective and i.Scription refractions for the spherical and cylindrical components.

A VA measurement test that utilizes standard commercial instrumentation (4K screen driven by an iPad App) and measures VA more comprehensively than the ETDRS has been developed for use in multisite regulatory clinical studies. The study objective was to validate the test application.\n\nMethods:\nThe test included VA measurements with luminance level (cd/m2) of 250 for daytime, 50 for indoor and 2.5 for night driving using high (90%) & low (10%) contrast charts. Two types of charts were evaluated: ISO (10 letters per line) and individual Landolt C (20 rings per line, each displayed for 300ms). The control was high & low contrast ETDRS with 160cd/m2 luminance. Measurements were carried out twice on the best corrected dominant eye of 34 subjects.\n\nResults:\nVA for 250/90% and ETDRS 160/90% in logMAR (mean diff 0.007 95%CI ±0.020; p=0.501) and VA 250/10% and ETDRS 160/10% (mean diff 0.013 95%CI ±0.023; p=0.286) were the same. Repeatability (mean diff & CI95% between visits 1&2) for the ISO charts at 250 (90%: 0.014±0.023 & 10%: 0.031±0.025) was similar to the ETDRS at 160 (90%: 0.016±0.024 & 10%: 0.012±0.020) and slightly greater for the more demanding 50 & 2.5 (90%: 0.024±0.027 & 0.028±0.043) luminance.

For PALs, raytracing is used to determine the PSF for a series of eye gaze positions. For multifocal contact and intraocular lenses, a high resolution Shack Hartmann sensor is used to the measure the wavefront associated with each lens. The PSF is then calculated from each wavefront. Realistic renderings of 3D scenes are achieved by decomposing the scene into a series of planes, each at a distinct distance. Objects in each plane are convolved with a depth-adjusted PSF. The planes are then recombined, accounting for occlusion by foreground objects, to form a simulated scene. Pupil size, eye gaze position and head orientation can also be controlled.\n\nResults:\nThe images below show the PSFs for different gaze angles through a PAL. The three images correspond to distant, intermediate and near planes. As expected, the upper portion of the lens has good performance for the distance plane, while the intermediate and near vision performance is good in the progressive corridor. Simulations of this gaze contingent modality are compared to multifocal contact lenses. Since the contact lenses move with the eye, the on-eye lenses provided a broader view of the scene independent of gaze direction.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThree-dimensional scene simulation provides a useful tool for analyzing the performance properties of various types of lenses used to treat presbyopia. The scenes provide realistic comparison of common visual situations and can illustrate the benefits and limitations of a vast array of very different presbyopia treatments. These simulations are useful for patient education as well as for comparing the performance between designs and modalities.","title":"Realistic Scenes Through Different Presbyopia Treatment Modalities","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175412\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Out of the 65 subjects, 25 subjects were from various regions of Appalachia. The measurements were made at 840 nm wavelength and the COAS software predict LCA for the wavelengths of 450 nm, 550nm, and 650 nm at 3mm pupil size. All the subjects were measured in their natural eyes (OD) in the dim room light condition.\n\nResults:\nThe longitudinal chromatic aberration for 3 mm pupil for young Appalachians and non-Appalachian youth were determined to be 1.85 D and 1.89D respectively. The population mean of LCA for 65 subjects was 1.88 D for the spectral range of 450 – 840 nm. Previous theoretical and experimental studies on LCA shows about 2 D of chromatic difference of power or refraction across visible spectrum with slight variations among studies. For a larger pupil size (5mm), LCA seems not to vary significantly compared to the LCA of smaller pupil (3 mm). Higher order aberrations (HOA) at 3mm were very small, nevertheless at larger pupil the HOA was significantly higher with insignificant change to LCA value.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe longitudinal chromatic aberration in the young Appalachian eyes are identical to the longitudinal chromatic aberration values of non-Appalachian counterparts. Larger pupil size didn’t change the amount of LCA due to the higher order aberrations in the eye.","title":"Longitudinal Chromatic Aberrations in young Appalachian eyes.","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175403\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jesson Martin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Kentucky College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study is to quantify the difference in perceived overall image quality and 3 factors (blur, contrast, ghosting) for the optimized and habitual refractive corrections in individuals with Down syndrome (DS).\n\nMethods:\nUncorrected wavefront error and habitual refraction of 30 adult subjects with DS were measured. For each DS eye, the predicted refraction corresponding to the optimized value of 16 image quality metrics was identified and used to create logMAR charts in addition to charts based on habitual refraction. Each simulated chart was read and rated by 5 control observers.

Among optical treatments, orthokeratology (OK) lenses have demonstrated consistent reduced myopia progression compared to spectacles and single vision contact lenses. A common reason for “failed” OK fits is lens decentration, which leads to poor vision and concerns for ocular health. In the Myopia Control Clinic at UC Berkeley, we are often able to fix lens decentration by switching patients to a bitoric lens design, the Dual Axis (DA) lens. In this study, we worked to characterize the short-term fitting characteristics of DA lenses compared to standard OK lenses.\n\nMethods:\nThis study was a single masked, prospective randomized crossover study. 24 subjects who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled and randomly allocated to wear a DA CRT lens in their right or left eye and a standard (spherical) CRT lens in their fellow eye at the initial visit. After 1 week of lens wear, subjects underwent a washout period of at least 1 week (up to 2 weeks), after which point they were switched to the alternate lens design in each eye. Follow ups occurred at 1 day and 1 week after lens wear for each set of lenses. The crossover trial design is advantageous because each subject had the opportunity to wear each type of lens, so their subjective impression of their vision and comfort could be compared.\n\nResults:\nOf the 24 subjects recruited for this study, 20 (83%) were female and 16 (67%) were Asian, with an average age of 25 years. The subjects had on average -3.84D myopia with 0.20 D with the rule astigmatism. We found a significant difference in unaided visual acuity after 1 night of lens wear with those subjects fit with DA lenses having better acuity (LogMAR 0.3 vs 0.41). Subjects also reported faster improvement to best VA in the eye wearing a DA lens. Qualitatively, corneal topography at one day appeared more like one-week follow-up topography for eyes wearing DA lenses, although the end result was similar for all eyes treated.\n\nConclusion(s):\nClinical observation of the use of DA lenses suggests that they will improve OK lens centration. While lens decentration was not problematic for our subject population, we found that DA lenses led to faster improvement in visual acuity and more stable topography compared to spherical lenses, indicating that DA lenses are advantageous even for corneas with minimal toricity.","title":"A Randomized Crossover Trial Comparing Spherical CRT Lenses to Dual Axis CRT Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175405\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Maria Liu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UC Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects were randomized into ortho-K or control (spectacle or soft contact lens correction) groups. Axial and peripheral refraction were measured along the central 300 of the horizontal visual field with the Grand Seiko WAM5500 open-field auto-refractor at the enrollment, 6-month and 1-year examinations. Only right eye data was used for statistical analysis. Paired t-test was performed to compare the 12-month change in axial and peripheral refraction in the ortho-k group to those in the control group.\n\nResults:\nTwenty-four subjects completed 12-months visit (11 in ortho-k group, 13 in control group). Both control and ortho-k groups showed relatively constant mean sphere refraction across the field or relative hyperopia in the periphery as compared with the central refraction. Mean spherical equivalent changed from -2.05D (enrollment visit) to -0.24 (12 month visit) in the ortho-k group and from -2.75D to -2.86D in the control group, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups ( P < 0.0001). Peripheral refraction showed no significant change during the 12 months in the control group. As a result of the 12 month ortho-k treatment, myopia decreased at a reduced rate out into the periphery, resulting in a relative peripheral myopia.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOrthokeratology successfully corrected myopia in the central +50 of the visual field with less myopia correction in the periphery, thus converting the peripheral refraction from relative emmetropia or hyperopia to relative myopia in young adults.","title":"Effect of Orthokeratology on Peripheral Refraction in Young Adults","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175406\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Stephanie Fromstein, Yi Pang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This pilot study evaluated the USee for use in a larger study of US children. Ultimately, it is hoped that the USee can be used to refract and prescribe glasses for patients in developing countries.\n\nMethods:\n48 students from the New England College of Optometry with known spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error ≤6.00 diopters (D) myopia or hyperopia, astigmatism ≤2.00D in both eyes were recruited. Subjects underwent autorefraction, self-refraction by the USee device, manifest refraction by the investigator and visual acuity (VA) through U-See pop-in spectacles. All testing was non-cycloplegic. Finally, subjects answered four questions about their experience with the U-See device.\n\nResults:\nAmong the 48 subjects (mean age 25.5 years, 79.2% female) the mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was identical between USee refraction and manifest refraction in the better eye {logMAR VA (SD), -0.1[0.1]} and worse eye {-0.1 [0.1]}. The mean difference in SE between the USee refraction and manifest refraction was 0.16D±0.9D in the right eye, 0.18D±0.9D in the left eye. Mean autorefraction and USee refraction were similar in both eyes (-3.50D±1.5D), and were comparable to the mean manifest refraction in both eyes (-3.30D±1.7D). When questioned about the USee device experience, 94% of subjects said the USee device was easy to use. 98% felt that compared to no correction, the pop-in U-See spectacles improved vision. 48% thought the U-See spectacles worked as well as their current spectacles.\n\nConclusion(s):\nSelf-refraction with the USee device demonstrates comparable measures of SE and BCVA to that of manifest refraction and autorefraction for low to moderate refractive errors in these subjects. Future directions will focus on the usability of this device in a broader range of ages, including children.","title":"Evaluation of a Novel Self-Refraction Device (USee) to Measure Refractive Error in Adults – A Pilot Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175407\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Gayathri Srinivasan, Bruce Moore, Paulette Tattersall, Lucy Mudie, David Friedman, Kevin White\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The New England College of Optometry, The New England College of Optometry, The New England College of Optometry, Johns Hopkins Institutions, Johns Hopkins Institutions, Global Vision 2020\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Most have either compared the measured findings with a “gold standard” (typically subjective refraction), or examined repeatability by quantifying the distribution of repeated measurements. However, neither method demonstrates which procedure or instrument provides the most accurate assessment of refractive error. This study measured refractive error before and after the introduction of an additional cylindrical lens. Comparison of the difference in measurements with the cylinder power will identify which technique is most accurate in quantifying the known change.\n\nMethod:\nThe study was performed on 20, visually-normal subjects. Non-cycloplegic refractive error was measured both before and after the introduction of a -2.00D cylinder, axis 45 degrees before the right eye using: (i) static retinoscopy, (ii) subjective refraction, (iii) SmartVision SVOne handheld autorefractor and (iv) Grand Seiko WAM-5500 open-field autorefractor. All results were converted to power vectors to calculate the mean difference between the two measurements. This mean difference was subsequently converted to a single vector (B). A mean value of 1.0 represents perfect agreement with the additional lens (Pl -2.00 x 45).\n\nResults:\nThe mean values of B for retinoscopy, subjective refraction, SVOne and WAM-5500 were 1.59, 1.64, 1.41 and 1.16, respectively (p = 0.02).

For each subject we computed the refractions within [(s-0.75, c, ax):(s+0.75, c+1, ax)] in 0.25D-step and we sorted them according to the spherical equivalent (SE). For each spherocylindrical refraction of the interval we measured the subject’s monocular visual acuity (VA) with the bestPEST psychophysical method in a 8-alternative (Landolt C) forced choice task. This procedure was repeated 4 times for each subject (two in increasing order of SE and two in decreasing order). We plotted VA [logMAR] vs SE [Diopters] for each subject and established the best fit between both magnitudes.\n\nResults:\nThe best fit corresponded to an exponential function of the type: VA=a*exp(b*SE)+c where a, b, c are parameters that depended on each subject.

Even though the average goodness-of-fit obtained using an exponential function is reasonably good, the scatter plots of VA as a function of SE-defocus revealed that the ideal function might not to be exactly monotonic especially in the presence of spherocylindrical defocus. These results have important implications if a multidimensional Bayesian adaptive psychometric method is applied to obtain the VA as a function of spherocylindrical defocus.","title":"Parametrization of the Relationship Between Visual Acuity and Spherocylindrical Defocus in a 2-Dimensional Plane","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175400\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Davalor Research Center-Univ.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel form of pseudo-custom HOA correction (templates) on simulated KC eyes.\n\nMethods:\nOne hundred simulated KC wavefront error (WFE) maps (5mm-pupil) were created using a numerical model. For each WFE, a custom Matlab algorithm was used to identify which of 5 existing HOA correcting templates, as well as 1 coma only correcting template, resulted in the lowest level of residual higher order RMS (HORMS). Lower order corrections (LOC) defining a refractive space within ±5D of sphere and up to -8D of cylinder (2° steps) centered on the full LOC were mathematically applied to each uncorrected WFE. This step was repeated for each map with no template correction.  Residual WFE with each LOC was calculated and reduced to a single value using the visual image quality metric visual Strehl ratio (VSX), which has been shown to predict change in visual performance in KC. The LOC and HOA template combination resulting in the best VSX value was identified.\n\nResults:\nOn average, HORMS with the best template correction is reduced by 59% as compared to the uncorrected eye (Wilcoxon paired test, p1/\n2\nline compared to LOC only.\n\nConclusion(s):\nApplying template corrections on simulated KC subjects, along with LOC, is predicted to reduce RMS by a factor of 2 on average and improve visual acuity by a clinically significant amount.","title":"Application of Template-Based Optical Corrections to Simulated Keratoconus Subjects","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175401\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jos Rozema, Gareth Hatings, Raymond Applegate, Jason Marsack\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Department of Ophthalmology Antwerp University Hospital, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, the orientation of the residual net aberration structure, and consequently the ghosting and blur of retinal images, through the CLs is opposite to that to which the eye is habitually accustomed. This study aims to characterize and quantify the net reversal in aberration structure of highly aberrated eyes changing from spectacles to scleral CLs.\n\nMethods:\nWFE were measured in 6 eyes of 3 subjects both unaided and through a scleral CL. Zernike aberrations were fit (to 10th radial order) and compared over a 5 mm pupil. The two WFEs were examined at 16384 points and the percentage of points that changed in net sign (from being advanced to being delayed, or vice versa) was determined.\n\nResults:\nHigher order root mean square WFE reduced in all eyes from spectacles to CL (mean 58 ± 5%). Third order terms C6 (sine trefoil) and C7 (sine (vertical) coma) were habitually the aberrations of greatest magnitude and the aberrations that reversed by the largest amount; C9 (cosine trefoil) and C7, now of the opposite sign, were the aberrations of greatest residual magnitude through a CL.\n\nAcross all eyes, 19 (79%) of the 24 third order terms reversed in sign, while 25 (83%) of the 30 fourth order coefficients and approximately half of the fifth order reversed in sign.\n\nConsistent with sign reversal, the mean orientation of total coma changed by 185°.\n\nOver the whole 5mm pupil, 59% of the examined WFE points reversed in sign.\n\nConclusion(s):\nTo a large extent, net aberration structure reverses between spectacle and CL wear in highly aberrated eyes. Third order aberrations displayed the largest reversals and contributed most to the net reversal in sampled points, followed by fourth order aberrations.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of objective refraction Vs habitual refractive corrections.\n\nMethods\n: Habitual refraction (spectacles: n=23, unaided: n=7) and dilated wavefront error (WFE) was obtained from the right eye of 30 subjects with DS. Single refractions corresponding to the optimized value for 16 different IQM were identified.  Acuity charts simulating resultant image quality were created from the residual WFE of all 16 IQM optimized plus habitual refractions for each DS eye. Five control observers read each of the simulated logMAR acuity charts to obtain visual acuity (VA). The IQM refraction that gave the best average VA for each DS eye was identified as the best metric refraction and compared to the VA for the habitual refraction charts. Refractions were converted to vector notation (M, J0 and J45) to calculate the dioptric difference between habitual and best metric refractions.\n\nResults:\nThe average total dioptric difference between the habitual and best metric refractions was 1.75D ± 1.44D (Range: 0.18 to 5.66D) and the average astigmatic dioptric difference was 0.67D ± 0.41D (Range: 0.14 to 1.82D). 91.67% of the eyes had at least 1.00D of difference in vector space between the refractions. VA was significantly improved (3.5 lines; t-test: p < 0.001) with the best metric refraction [0.11 ± 0.06 logMAR] over the habitual refraction [0.47 ± 0.25 logMAR]. The improvement in VA was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the dioptric difference between refractions (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nOptimized objective refraction is predicted to improve VA in DS eyes based on control observers reading simulated charts, indicating that the utilization of optimization techniques may be a useful tool to improve VA in this population.","title":"Objective Refractions Outperform Habitual Refractions in Down Syndrome Eyes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175396\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Julia Benoit, Jason Marsack, Heather Anderson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

One cyl power was assessed at each visit, comprising full cyl correction and undercorrection by 0.25D, 0.50D and 0.75D. Cyl axes tested at each visit comprised correct axis and misalignment by ±10º, ±20º and ±30º.\n\nVP comprised monocular high/low contrast visual acuity (HCVA/LCVA, logMAR) and subjective response (1-10 scale) for vision clarity (VC) and vision satisfaction (VS), all at 6m. Acuities and subjective responses were compared between power and axes changes using linear mixed model.\n\nResults:\nAt correct axis, 0.75D undercorrection was significantly worse than full correction for HCVA (0.00 ± 0.09 v -0.07 ± 0.09, p = 0.006); LCVA (0.34 ± 0.14 v 0.26 ± 0.17,\np\n< 0.001); VC (5.5± 2.5 v 7.6 ± 2.3,\np\n< 0.001) and VS (6.4 ± 2.0 v 8.1 ± 2.1,\np\n< 0.001). 0.50D undercorrection at correct axis was also significantly worse for HCVA (\np\n= 0.006), but not LCVA, VC or VS (\np\n> 0.2).\n\nThe effect of axis misalignment on VP was influenced by cyl power (\np\n< 0.001) but reduced with undercorrection. With up to 0.25D undercorrection, every 10º misalignment reduced VP significantly. However, with 0.50-0.75D undercorrection, misalignment up to 10º did not significantly affect VP. Misalignment ≥20º reduced VP significantly so that misalignment of 20º or 30º was not different. The combined effect of changes in power and axes on VP was also affected by the magnitude of cyl power, with the impact increasing with cyl power.\n\nConclusion(s):\nVP was affected by changes in both cyl power and axes at varying levels. Cyl power reduction by up to 0.50D has little effect on VP at correct axis, while cyl power influences the effect of axis misalignment on VP. These data may provide insight in to the minimum parameter range required to adequately correct cyl in contact lens wear.","title":"Sensitivity of Astigmats to Changes in Cylinder Power and Axis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175397\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Brien Holden Vision Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jennifer Sha, Jennie Diec, Nisha Yeotikar, Monica Jong, Cathleen Fedtke, Varghese Thomas, Ravi Bakaraju\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Brien Holden Vision Institute, Brien Holden Vision Institute, Brien Holden Vision Institute, Brien Holden Vision Institute, Brien Holden Vision Institute, Brien Holden Vision Institute, Brien Holden Vision Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Research is underway to explore the etiologic factors and its association with RE to reduce visual impairment. Breastfeeding was considered as one of the risk factors for the development of RE. This study aims to investigate the relationship between RE and Breastfeeding in Saudi primary school children.\n\nMethods:\nIn this cross-sectional study, cluster sampling was used to select 417 primary school children aged 6 to 13 years. The RE of children was identified by means of cycloplegic autorefraction after obtaining a written informed consent from the parents. A questionnaire was sent out to parents and information on history of breast feeding, birth weight, systemic and ocular history of the children, outdoor and indoor activities of the children were collected. Children with the history of premature birth, trauma, ocular surgery, hormonal injections were excluded. The sample included for analysis was 202 children. Breastfeeding was de¿ned as 6 months or more feeding. A signi¿cant RE was de¿ned as at least -0.50 D for myopia, +0.50 D for hyperopia, and -0.50 D for astigmatism.\n\nResults:\nThe mean age of the children was 9.82±1.88 years. Out of 202 children, 80 (39.6%) were breastfed and 122 (60.4%) were not. For hyperopia and myopia, the mean spherical equivalent refractive error of breastfed children was 0.24 D (p=0.19), 0.48 D (p=0.09) lower than that of children who were not breastfed. However, the mean astigmatic error of breastfed children was 0.33 D (P=0.003; OR=1.88) significantly lower than that of children who were not breastfed.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe results show that duration of breast feeding is significantly associated with astigmatic RE in Saudi primary school children. For hyperopic and myopic refractive errors, no significant relationship was found. However, for exact judgement about these ¿ndings, more studies are suggested with a larger sample size.","title":"Breastfeeding and Association with Refractive Error in Saudi Arabian Children","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175398\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Qassim University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Muath Alsharqi, Vishakh Nair, Naganathan Muthuramalingam\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Qassim University, Qassim University, Qassim University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Here, a wrist-worn device was employed to continuously measure light exposure to assess the influence of light intensity and spectral composition on eye growth in children in a two year longitudinal study.\n\nMethods:\nChildren wore an actigraph device (Actiwatch Spectrum) continuously for six two-week sessions during school (spring, fall) and summer over two years to quantify light exposure, activity, and sleep. Cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction (SER) and axial length (AL) were measured at baseline, one year (n=60), and two years (n=50). Actigraph data were analyzed in terms of season and refractive error group. Light exposure > 1000 lux was considered to be outdoors.\n\nResults:\nAge at enrollment was 7.55 ± 1.8 (mean ± SD) years. Baseline SER was +0.86 ± 1.55 D and at the two year follow up was +0.46 ± 1.8 2D. Baseline AL was 22.7 ± 0.88 mm and at two years was 23.06 ± 0.90 mm. Children’s behaviors were not different for similar seasons of year 1 and year 2, spending 94 ± 34 m outdoors in spring, 108 ± 48 m outdoors in summer, and 74 ± 31 m outdoors in fall. Activity levels and sleep duration were similar between seasons (p > 0.05 for both). During the summer sessions, emmetropic children spent 115 ± 40 m outdoors and myopic children spent 90 ± 40 m outdoors. For all seasons, red light exposure was minimally greater than blue, although both were highly correlated with broadband light exposure.\n\nConclusion(s):\nChildren received a significantly greater amount of light and spent more time outdoors during the summer. Trends show that myopic spent less time outdoors in the summer compared to emmetropes. Future studies on illumination levels and spectral composition may serve to provide recommendations for children in regards to myopia progression.","title":"Objective Measurement of Light Exposure, Activity and Sleep Over Two Years in Children","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175383\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lisa Ostrin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

We evaluated the effect of light exposure on ipRGC-mediated pupil responses in myopes.\n\nMethods:\nSubjects were 10 myopic adults 23.6 ± 0.6 years of age (average ± SD), 60% female, with refractive errors ranging from -2.09 D to -4.78 D by cycloplegic autorefraction. Subjects were instructed to spend 5 days with a high level of outdoor activity and 5 days with a low level. Weeks were chosen in random order with at least 1 week of normal activity in between. Light exposure was monitored with a personal light dosimeter (Daysimeter). The RAPDx pupilometer measured pupil responses to 6 cycles of blue/dark oscillating at 0.1 Hz. The primary outcome was the average coefficient for the exponential decay function fit to the final 3 seconds of each redilation.\n\nResults:\nSubjects experienced 0.6 log lux-minutes greater light exposure in their high light week compared to their low light week (p < 0.0001). The average decay coefficient of -0.066 ± 0.045 was not significantly different between weeks (p = 0.81). However, the effect of week showed a significant interaction with refractive error (interaction p=0.046). Decay coefficients were more positive (slower redilation) for less myopic refractive errors in the low light week but more negative (faster redilation) for less myopic refractive errors in the high light week.\n\nConclusion(s):\nWe attribute slower redilation following blue-only stimulation to persistent input to the pupil response from ipRGCs. Higher light exposure appears to inhibit this potentially beneficial ipRGC activity in some myopes and may help explain why time outdoors lowers risk of onset but does not affect the rate of myopic progression.","title":"The Effect of Light Exposure and Refractive Error on Post-Illumination Pupil Responses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175384\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Donald Mutti\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The aim of this study was to establish the biomechanical profile of young, healthy Asian myopic individuals in relation to spherical equivalent, axial length and pupil diameter. Such parameters are paramount when determining the success of orthokeratology, which rely on changes in corneal biomechanics.\n\nMethods:\n212 healthy Asian myopic subjects (age: 5-25 years) were divided into groups of low myopia (-3.00D ≥ SE ≤ -0.50D), moderate myopia (-6.00D ≤ SE ≤ -3.00D) and high myopia (SE < -6.00D). Corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), cornea-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc) and Goldmann correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg) were evaluated using the ORA (Reichart). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v19 (IBM, USA).\n\nResults:\nPearson correlation revealed CH was significantly correlated with spherical equivalent in all three myopic groups (p < 0.05 for all three groups), but correlated with IOPg and pupil size in only the moderate myopic group (r= -0.40, 0.280, respectively, p < 0.05). Between group ANOVA revealed significantly lower CH and CRF factor in high vs. low and moderate myopes (p < 0.001). Finally, multivariate regression analysis revealed that pupil size was a strong predictor for CH and CRF.\n\nConclusion(s):\nVariation in corneal biomechanical properties depends on the degree of myopia. Those with moderate myopia show the strongest correlation between CH and pupil size. These results show the importance of using not only parameters such as CCT and axial length, but to use biomechanical parameters such as CH and CRF, especially when such interventions rely on biomechanical changes in the cornea for effectiveness.","title":"The Biomechanical Properties of Myopic Chinese Individuals","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175385\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Edward Chow, Tara Zeng\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dr. Edward Chow and Associates, Ontario College of Art and Design\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects were fitted (OD) with both Proclear D and Biofinity D multifocal with a +2.50 D add, in random order. High- and low- contrast logMAR visual acuity (HCVA and LCVA) were measured with each SCL after spherical over-refraction and with a SE spectacle lens. Cycloplegic autorefraction was measured centrally and at 20°, 30° and 40° nasally and temporally. Five measurements were made per location, converted to power vectors (M, J0, and J45), and averaged. The difference in defocus between each peripheral location and the central location was calculated to obtain relative peripheral defocus (RPD). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVAs with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected post-hoc t-tests, when appropriate.\n\nResults:\nSubjects’ mean age (± SD) and SE refractive error were 23.9 ± 2.1 years and -3.05 ± 1.50 D, respectively. On average, HCVA was 2 lines better than LCVA (p < 0.001) and did not depend on correction type (SCLs vs SE spectacles; p = 0.10). Proclear D provided statistically better HCVA and LCVA than Biofinity D (roughly 2 letters; p < 0.02). The change in RPD at each location depended on the SCL type (p < 0.001). Proclear D caused significant myopic shifts relative to the uncorrected eye at 40N, 30N, and 20T, while Biofinity D caused myopic shifts relative to the uncorrected eye at more retinal locations (40N, 30N, 20T, 30T, and 40T; all p ≤ 0.03).\n\nConclusion(s):\nVisual acuity with both Biofinity D and Proclear D was similar.

Current technology allows for objective measurements of light exposure; however, quantification of near work is assessed via questionnaires, which are subject to poor recall and biases. The goal of this study was to test the RangeLife, a custom device developed for continuous, objective measurement of near work.\n\nMethods:\nAn infrared sensor was programmed to log distance at 1 Hz. The device uses a narrow beam laser with nanosecond technology to detect distance from surfaces directly in front of it. The device is powered by a rechargeable lithium battery to enable continuous data logging. The device was tested for known distances from 0.05 to 2 meters (m) in 0.05 m intervals. Following calibration, the device was mounted on the right temple of a spectacle frame and directed 4º nasally. Adult subjects (n = 4) wore the device for waking hours and maintained a log of activities. RangeLife data were binned into 0.10 m intervals and compared to the log entries.\n\nResults:\nThe device demonstrated a linear correlation with known distances from 0.05 to 1.2 m. Beyond 1.2 m, distances were out of range and considered “distance viewing” for the purposes of this study. In comparison to logs, the device recorded time spent using a computer as near viewing for 85 ± 3.6% of the time, with the majority of time spent at a working distance of 0.50-0.59 m. Reading printed material was recorded at 0.38 ± 0.16 m. Throughout one day, subjects spent 54 ± 22 min at a viewing distance of 0.30-0.39 m, 76.6 ± 32.9 min at 0.40-0.49 m, 71.3 ± 16.1 min at 0.50-0.59 m, and 46.5 ± 31.5 min at 0.60-0.69 m.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe RangeLife provided continuous and objective measurements of working distances.

Visits occurred at the same time of day to control for diurnal variation. Subjects wore best correction and viewed a distant target (television) in standard lighting for one hour before each scan. Choroid thickness was determined from B-scan images using validated semi-automated image segmentation. For each B-scan, total choroidal area and area of the central 13° region were calculated; the mean of these areas across all 31 B-scans for each subject was also calculated (total and central region). Between-visit repeatability was evaluated using difference vs. mean plots. The false discovery rate was controlled using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.\n\nResults:\nSubjects’ (24 ± 2 years; 63% female) mean spherical equivalent refractive error was -3.46 ± 2.69 D (range: +2.62 to -8.50 D). There was no difference in mean foveal choroidal thickness: 283 µm (visit 1) and 288 µm (visit 2; p = 0.13).

Findings were compared to aberration profiles of reportedly successful orthokeratology outcomes.\n\nMethods:\nThe right eyes of 40 participants (25 women, 15 men) were fitted with Proclear soft multifocal center distance lenses (PMfSCL), which corrected the distance refractive errors and had four different add power values. Refractive errors were limited to a range of -0.25 D up to -6.00 D of sphere, and no greater than -0.75 D of cylinder. Wavefront aberrations were determined over 6 mm entrance pupil diameters with a Zeiss Atlas 9000 corneal topographer prior to, and following lens fitting. The wavefront aberrations were converted into RMS values, grouped per Zernike order, and analyzed. Finally, the results were compared to published wavefront aberration data from successful orthokeratology treatments.\n\nResults:\nFourth Zernike order wavefront aberrations reached statistical significance (p < 0.05) for add power values of > 1.00 D. This order also showed the largest RMS change of all Zernike orders. With the maximum add power of 2.50 D, the RMS changed from 0.282 μm ± 0.085 μm to 0.528 μm ± 0.108 μm. Statistically significant changes in Zernike orders 5 and 6 were also found for all lenses. However, compared to Zernike order 4 the RMS changes in these orders were small. As for individual aberrations, the highest coefficient measurements were obtained for vertical coma, horizontal coma, and spherical aberration. With higher add power values, these aberrations likewise increased. Their Zernike coefficients changed as follows: vertical coma from -0.082 μm ± 0.168 μm to 0.071 μm ± 0.182 μm, horizontal coma from -0.035 μm ± 0.159 μm to 0.067 μm ± 0.202 μm, and spherical aberration from 0.256 μm ± 0.098 μm to 0.489 μm ± 0.129 μm.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe use of PMfSCL leads to a significant increase in higher-order wavefront aberrations.

Along the horizontal visual field in eyes of young adults, PMCL with the highest add power of +2.50 D should be used to establish the required defocus on a statistically significant level.","title":"Preliminary Evaluation of Refractive Profiles in Eyes Using Multifocal Center Distance Soft Contact Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175390\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Western University of Health Sciences\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Pinakin Davey, Karen Diep, Gregory Lemay\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Western University of Health Sciences College of Optometry, Western University of Health Sciences College of Optometry, Western University of Health Sciences College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

According to the spherical equivalent (SE) after mydriasis, the study children were divided into two groups: 1. 120 cases of non-myopia group (between -0.25D to -1.0D). & myopia group of 712 cases (myopia > 0.75D). The accommodation response was measured at 33 cm as near and at a long distance (> 4 m) with an open field detector (Grand Seiko, WAM5500, Japan). The accommodation lag in these two groups were calculated by t test at differente time points as 4 year before myopia occurred, during myopia and 4 years after myopia occurred. Compared with the non-myopia group, the relationship between accommodation lag and the development of myopia were analyzed.\n\nResults:\nDuring the 1st grade to the 5th grade of primary school, the accommodation lag in the myopia group was always higher than that of the non-myopia group, the differences were statistically significant (the differences were 1.14D, 1.46D, 1.12D, 1.10D and 0.99D , P0.05),. However, two years before and 4 years after myopia onset, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (the differences were 0.30D, 0.71D, 1.20D, 0.96D, 0.85D and 0.93D, P <0.05).\n\nConclusion(s):\nChildren with myopia have shown a significant increasing accommodation lag two years before the myopia onset, and the accommodation lag maintains the high level after myopia onset. These findings suggest that the accommodation lag play an important role and might be the driving factor for the myopia onset and progress.","title":"The Relationship Between the Accommodation Lag and the Development of Children 's Myopia: The Anyang Childhood Eye Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175392\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Lakewood Eye Care\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Shimin Li, Nuoru Liu, Mengtian Kang, Ningli Wang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Beijing Tongren Eye Center Beijing Tongren Hospital Beijin, Anyang Eye Hospital Anyang Henan China, Beijing Tongren Eye Center Beijing Tongren Hospital Beijin, Beijing Tongren Eye Center Beijing Tongren Hospital Beijin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Only lenses were used and cut with the same diameter for comparison. In the first phase, a dual-beam spectrophotometer was used to compare the two lens groups with objective variables such as transmittance of ultraviolet and visible rays, optical aberrations and light scattering. For the second phase, 22 participants subjectively compared the two groups of lenses in double blind conditions. They evaluated contrast sensitivity (SAC) on a modified Mars scale and glare on a Boer scale with the 16 lenses in a randomized order.\n\nResults:\nObjective variables revealed that generic solar lenses had a significant higher diffusion (t=3.303; df=14; p=0.005) and higher oblique astigmatism (t=2.405; df=14; p=0.031). All other aberrations were higher for generic lenses but not significant. Participants reported higher glare with generic lenses (t=3.204; df=350; p=0.001). This effect could have been even more important as the mean transmittance of the brand lenses sample was higher than generic one. No differences were found for SAC and UV protection.\n\nConclusion(s):\nSpecialized lenses have shown better performance for both objective and subjective variables. Generic lenses showed high variability, which contributed to a significant decrease in mean performance. From the consumer's point of view, the properties of lenses purchased from non-specialized stores appear to be more unpredictable. Quality and fit of the frames are also essential to the sunglasses performance but were not analyzed in this study.","title":"Objective and Subjective Comparison of Brand and Generic Sunglasses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175376\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Universite de Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Arnaud Bergeron-Courteau, Sarah-Eve Lavoie, Benoit Frenette\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Universite de Montreal, Universite de Montreal, Univertsite de Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The surface sweeping speed was 100 mm/sec. The front and back surface heights were physically measured and the surface shapes were represented as the sum of Zernike polynomials within 60-mm diameter. The powers of each surface, and their combination, were calculated and analyzed with custom MATLAB programs with a pupil size of 4.5 mm in terms of contour plots of spherical equivalent and astigmatism. The accuracy and repeatability of the measured surface powers via the surface sweeping technique were evaluated by taking six measurements at the same testing setup and procedure. The measuring time spent during each measurement was also assessed.\n\nResults:\nAs expected, surface powers of the tested lenses are directly related to their front and back surface designs. The differences in the spherical equivalent and astigmatism at the optical center are less than 0.13 D and 0.06 D respectively compared with the designed nominal distance powers. The repeatability test results show that the whole-surface power variations at the same location are less than 0.05 D. The average measuring time spent by the surface sweeping technique is about 50 seconds per surface, which saves measuring time up to 1000 times compared with traditional touch trigger point-type CMM method at the same measuring density.\n\nConclusion(s):\nBy direct physical measurement of the surface shapes of lenses, the CMM with rapid surface sweeping technique can not only provide the accurate powers of lenses but also greatly shorten the measuring time, which is comparable to the optical measuring method.","title":"Whole-Surface Power Measurement of Lenses by Rapid Surface Sweeping Profilometry","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175377\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Da-Yeh University, Department of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Light in the 415 to 455 nm range increases oxidative stress to retinal pigment epithelial cells and potentiates the development of Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Light in the 460 to 500 nm range impacts sleep by inhibiting production of melatonin by the pineal gland. Blocking light in the lower blue spectrum should, therefore, theoretically protect the macula. Blocking light in the higher blue spectrum could potentially improve sleep if used in the evening, but reduce alertness if used during the day. This study was designed to look at the blue light transmission properties of various commercially available lenses that claim to decrease the amount of blue light transmission thru the lens or lens coating.\n\nMethods:\nThe variability in the effects of blue light at different wavelengths requires the eye care professional (ECP) to better understand the light transmission properties of the lenses we prescribe. Unfortunately, we have little information on the specific blue light transmission properties of most of these lenses. We acquired eleven different lenses or lenses with coatings marketed as having blue light blocking ability and evaluated the blue light transmission thru these lenses (400 – 500 nm) with a BPI spectrophotometer.\n\nResults:\nOf the lenses tested, transmission at 400 nm ranged from 0 to 67.7%; 430 nm ranged from 27.2 to 81.0%; 460 nm ranged from 74.8 to 93.2%; and 500 nm ranged from 81.7 to 95.6%.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur data showed surprising variance in transmission of blue light amongst the lenses/lens coatings tested. We propose that a standardized nomenclature for the light transmission characteristics of prescription lenses and lens coatings be developed. This would markedly improve our abilities to prescribe the appropriate lenses to protect our patients against oxidative stress and for maintaining circadian rhythms.","title":"Blue Light Transmission Characteristics of Commercially Available Spectacle Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175378\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Scott Tanner, Christopher Woody, Sandra Weber\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Limestone College, Pelham Vision Center, Greenville Health System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, little is known regarding their spatial visual function. Here, we assessed grating acuity in adult guinea pigs with a customized optomotor instrument and compared results with ganglion cell sampling density in the visual streak.\n\nMethods:\nA custom optomotor instrument with a 110 cm diameter drum was utilized, lined with square wave gratings at 100% contrast. Adult guinea pigs (n = 6) were tested with a range of spatial frequencies from 0.3 to 2.4 cycles per degree (cpd), both monocularly and binocularly. The drum was rotated at a constant speed of 12 deg/s in the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. The presence of head tracking was observed for each spatial frequency and direction. Guinea pigs were then sacrificed for retinal ganglion cell counting. After enucleation, ganglion cells were immunolabeled with antibodies against RNA binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) in retinal whole mounts, and imaged (Delta Vision Elite). The peak ganglion cell density in the region of the visual streak was determined with semi-automated and manual counting. A three surface schematic eye was developed for guinea pig eyes to calculate the retinal magnification factor.\n\nResults:\nSpatial frequency cut off was 1.65 ± 0.49 cpd for the temporal to nasal stimulus direction and 0.75 ± 0.16 cpd for the nasal to temporal stimulus direction. The visual streak extended from nasal to temporal retina, with a peak ganglion cell density of 1173±169 cells/mm2. Ganglion cell density decreased in the periphery to 123±9 cells/mm2. The calculated sampling density was 3.39 cells/degree and the calculated upper limit of spatial resolving power was 1.69 cpd.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe grating acuity predicted from the in vitro ganglion cell density was comparable to optomotor responses, which validates the utility of the methodology in assessing functional changes in vision in this animal model of myopia.","title":"Spatial Frequency Discrimination in Guinea pigs: Functional and Structural Measures","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175379\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sudan Puri, Krista Beach, Lisa Ostrin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study was to determine if form deprivation-induced myopia concomitantly impacts guinea pig ciliary body development.\n\nMethods:\nChanges in ciliary body gene expression were assessed following monocular form deprivation of Strain 13 guinea pigs (n = 3) for ~1 week. Eyes were then enucleated, placed in RNAlater®, RNA was isolated from the ciliary bodies, sequenced (Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform), and treated and control eye gene expression differences were determined with bioinformatics and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). Morphologically induced ciliary muscle changes were investigated by monocularly form depriving Strain 13 (n=4) and Cincinnati (n=4) guinea pigs for ~1 week and histologically analyzing between eye differences.\n\nResults:\nBioinformatics determined that collagen alpha-1 (XII) chain (-2.30 fold) and thrombospondin-1 (-2.30 fold) were significantly (P < 0.10) downregulated in the treated eyes compared to the control eyes. IPA found an additional 470 genes that met a 1.5 fold differential expression threshold, genes that were primarily associated with (number of genes) cell morphology (169), cell movement (143), cellular development (161), cellular growth and proliferation (225), and cellular assembly and organization (152). Morphological analysis indicated that mean ciliary muscle growth was inhibited in treated compared to control eyes (cross-sectional areas: 0.045 ± 0.01 mm2 vs. 0.052 ± 0.02 mm2; cell sizes: 244.02 ± 22.83 μm2/cell vs. 250.23 ± 23.77 μm2/cell).\n\nConclusion(s):\nBoth approaches failed to find evidence of ciliary body hypertrophy in response to monocular form deprivation after 1 week, a stimulus that may actually inhibit growth. These data are in contrast to human findings, which may indicate that form deprivation-induced myopia is different than human juvenile myopia.","title":"Impact of Form Deprivation-Induced Myopia on the Ciliary Body","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175381\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ashley Jackson, Kirk McHugh, Donald Mutti\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This virus has been rapidly on the move across 69 countries and territories, including nearly 2,000 documented cases within the contiguous United States. With the rise of global travel and international trade, further spread and transmission into regions where the virus is not endemic is likely. Although Zika infections are self-limiting, fetal microcephaly and ophthalmic anomalies have been associated with this infection. With new confirmed cases daily, chances are this may be a condition optometrists may encounter in their practice and are encouraged to report suspect Zika cases to their state or local health departments.","title":"Eye Care Providers on Front Lines of Zika Virus","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        PH-06\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E270\n                    \n            |#|"}

Measuring Macular Pigment Optical Density (MPOD) and re-pigmenting the human retina results in 1) Superior blue light protection; 2) Minimizing glare and intraocular scatter; 3) Quicker photo- stress glare recovery and 4) Faster visual sensory processing. This has all been published in the scientific literature for healthy eyes, merely awaiting application by the optometrist. Unfortunately few (perhaps 3 %) of optometrists, and fewer ophthalmologists, take advantage of the latest science concerning vision protection and enhancement.","title":"Carotenoid Rx for Healthy Eyes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        PH-07\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Captain James A Lovell Federal Health Care Center Eye Clinic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E271 AB\n                    \n            |#|"}

It is important to distinguish the underlying cause of the OCT findings for appropriate management of the condition.","title":"Glaucoma Masqueraders – Conditions That Mimic Optical Coherence Tomography Findings in Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        NO-10\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA Palo Alto Healthcare System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        David Yang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA Palo Alto Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E271 AB\n                    \n            |#|"}

Two components: diplopia and confusion appear to be coexisting.\nUsually only diplopia is reported.\n\nThis can be explained as a result of the statistics of natural images.\n\nBinocular confusion is the main tool for prismatic expansion of visual fields.\n\nWith visual field loss alone, and with use of prism segments for field expansion, the two phenomena may exist in isolation, diplopia without confusion, and confusion without diplopia. The roles both play in vision rehabilitation will be explained for common and rare conditions. This should lead to better rehabilitation and care.","title":"Diplopia and Confusion in Visual Field Rehabilitation","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        LV-13\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens ERI, MEE, Harvard Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E350\n                    \n            |#|"}

While anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is the most common ocular manifestation of GCA, amaurosis fugax, retinal artery occlusions, cranial nerve palsies, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy are also sequelae. Early diagnosis and urgent treatment of GCA is required to prevent possible bilateral blindness. Standards of care for the more common etiologies of the ocular manifestations of GCA may not involve the same urgency of intervention. Therefore, optometrists are placed in the difficult situation of determining the likelihood of GCA being the underlying cause of these relatively common ocular diagnoses.","title":"Giant Cell Arteritis: A Cause Lurking Behind Several Common Ocular Diagnoses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        NO-04\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        San Francisco VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Bernard Dolan, Heather Jones\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        San Francisco VA Medical Center, San Francisco VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E354B\n                    \n            |#|"}

Finally, a review of recent research advances in vision and driving and future challenges will be presented.","title":"Rapid Fire: Vision and Driving: From Research to Evidence-Based Clinical Practice","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        LV-10\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Roanne Flom, Gregory Hopkins, San-San Cooley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E350\n                    \n            |#|"}

Nightwear orthokeratology is still considered to be the most effective & safest method. In order to construct a lens that will achieve the best results, we have to understand the basic optics behind the Peripheral Defocus Theory. Corneal changes through orthokeratology are not mechanical; rather, they are created via fluid forces exerted under the various curves of the posterior lens surface.

That having been said, the next questions are obvious: who are the candidates? At what stage should we intervene? Which are the right ways for effectively controlling myopia?  This lecture attempts to establish these parameters, but is not simply another review of myopia control strategy. It is interactive and asks practitioners to put into practice myopia control strategies with the best options in contact lenses.","title":"Be In Charge of Your Myopia Control Strategy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        CL-02\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Montreal School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E450B\n                    \n            |#|"}

Longer eyes are expected to have lower rigidity. While there is currently no reliable clinical method to assess OR, our group has recently developed a technique permitting a direct and non-invasive measurement of OR in humans (Beaton et al., 2015). The purpose of this study is to compare OR in healthy myopic and non-myopic eyes, as well as demonstrate the reproducibility of our novel technique.\n\nMethods:\nBased on Friedenwald’s equation, our method involves video-rate OCT imaging of the choroid coupled with a novel automated segmentation algorithm to measure the pulsatile ocular volume change, as well as Dynamic Contour Tonometry (Ziemer group) to determine the ocular pulse amplitude, and thus calculate OR. Thirty-six age-matched adults with healthy eyes (7 myopic eyes with axial length > 25.00mm, and 29 non-myopic eyes) were recruited and OR measurement was carried out. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare differences between both groups. Thirty-eight additional subjects were enrolled for the study of reproducibility which was assessed using the Bland-Altman Plot and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC).\n\nResults:\nThere was a significant difference in the OR coefficients between the axial myopic eyes (OR= 0.02728 ± 0.01864/μL) and the non-myopic eyes (OR = 0.05239 ± 0.02369/μL); t(34)= 2.71, p = 0.010. The Bland-Altman plot, as well as the ICC (0.889, 95% CI [0.785, 0.943]), showed good agreement between intra-session measurements of OR in all examined eyes.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis study confirms that eyes with axial myopia have lower OR than non-myopic eyes, perhaps permitting further investigation unto the progression of myopia. The reproducibility of our novel non-invasive method is also confirmed, thus permitting further investigation of the role of OR in ocular disease such as glaucoma.","title":"A Novel Clinical Method for the Measurement of Ocular Rigidity Using Video-Rate OCT Imaging - Relevance in Axial Myopia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175375\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Javier Mazzaferri, Luke Beaton, Santiago Costantino, Mark Lesk\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

BNO is a technique in which partial occluders are added to the spectacle lenses to suppress the abnormal peripheral visual motion information. This technique helps in reducing VMS symptoms (i.e., nausea, dizziness, balance difficulty, visual confusion). Therefore, using this simple technique would be beneficial in treating these patients and improving their activities of daily living (ADL). Currently, there are no cases in which BNO was used for patients with mTBI and vestibular hypofunction.\n\nCase Report:\nA 44-year-old African American female presented for a routine eye exam with a history of mTBI 33 years ago. She was suffering from severe dizziness for the last two years. The dizziness occurred in all body positions and all environments throughout the day. These symptoms were adversely impacting her ADL. She was diagnosed with vestibular hypofunction six months prior by her otolaryngologist. She had previously undergone vestibular therapy but reported little improvement. Ocular examination was unremarkable with a BCVA of 20/20 OD, OS at distance and near. Neurological exam revealed dizziness with both OKN drum and hand movement, especially in the left visual field. MRI of the brain was unremarkable. For her dizziness, BNO technique using black electric tape was attempted on her single-vision distance spectacles. It allowed her to see both near and distance objects. This resulted in immediate relief of her dizziness symptoms. She felt comfortable and relaxed while walking in the clinic hallway regardless of peripheral visual stimulation.\n\nConclusion(s):\nBNO was able to suppress and filter abnormal peripheral visual motions in this case. This case reveals that the BNO technique can be beneficial for patients with mTBI and vestibular hypofunction.","title":"Management of mTBI and Vestibular Hypofunction with the Binasal Occlusion Technique","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175372\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Naveen Yadav\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Ikeda et al. reported resolution of retinoschisis after surgically induced posterior vitreous detachment, suggesting a link between vitreous traction and the development of retinoschisis. PPRS has variable impact on the retinal nerve fiber layer and visual field defects. The additional presence of retinoschisis along the vascular arcades may also impact visual field testing and further confound glaucoma management.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn a patient diagnosed with glaucoma suspicion, presence of bilateral PPRS and retinoschisis along the vascular arcades due to vitreous traction confounds management.

The accommodative response was measured with the PowerRef II, which was synchronized with an electro-optical Badal optometer that dynamically changed the accommodative stimulus. Each subject was instructed to clear the accommodative stimulus (black Maltese cross) and press a button once he/she cleared the stimulus. All of the subjects had normal accommodative amplitudes and accommodative facilities.\n\nResults:\nEach half cycle was fitted with an exponential function to compute the amplitude, time response and velocity. A mixed ANOVA with the following independent variables (each with 2 levels) was used: refraction (myopes, emmetropes), test (conventional, integrated) and direction (accommodation, disaccommodation) and demand (2 D, 4 D). There is a main effect of demand (p < 0.01) in all three variables. For amplitude, there is also a main effect of direction (p < 0.01) and for time response there is an interaction of direction*demand (p < 0.01) and test*demand (p < 0.01). There is not a systematic pattern between any of the measured variables and time.\n\nConclusion(s):\nDespite there are significant differences in the accommodative dynamics between accommodation and disacommodation and between 2 D and 4 D of accommodative demand, our results suggest that young subjects with good accommodative capabilities are not affected by the unpredictability of the accommodative stimulus during an accommodative facility task.","title":"Random Changes of Accommodative Stimulus: An Extension of the Accommodative Facility Test","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175374\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Davalor Research Center-Univ.

Upper and lower eyelid meibomian gland loss were marked using image J software and graded (0-3 scaling) using visual meiboscore methods.\n\nResults:\nA total of 73 contact lens wearers and 30 non lens wearers were included in the study. The median meiboscore was 3 in both contact lens group (IQR= 0) and non-contact lens group (IQR=0.75). The median meiboscore was 2 (IQR=1) in asymptomatic (n=50/73) contact lens group and 3(IQR=0) in symptomatic (n=23/73) contact lens group though there was no statistical significance (p=0.81). No statistical significant difference was noted in tear film, meibomian gland parameters and SPEED questionnaire score between CL and NCL wearers (p>0.05). The association between duration of CL wear (p=0.0074), CL wear/day (hours) (p=0.669) and meiboscore was not significant.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe relationship between CL use and meibomian gland atrophy or loss is still inconclusive and may be answered by a longitudinal, prospective evaluation of meibomian gland in CL wearers with larger sample size. Contact lens wearers with MG changes may present with symptoms. Hence it is wise to evaluate MG functioning in contact lens wearers for better follow-up, management, and to avoid contact lens dropouts.","title":"Meibomian Gland Functioning in Contact Lens and Non-Contact Lens Wearers – Are they Symptomatic?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175365\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Medical Research Foundation\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Rajesh Gannavarapu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Elite school optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects went through preliminary examination followed by a comprehensive battery of clinical tests. At the end of all these test comfort rating using visual analogue scale of vision, comfort, dryness and redness were documented. Conjunctival swab, contact lens sample and lens case sample were collected for microbial assessment.\n\nResults:\nA total of 24 contact lens wearers and 24 non contact lens wearers were included in the study. There was no growth of organism in conjunctival swab between CL and non-CL wearers, except for 2 subjects in each category with increased number of non pathogenic organism (\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\n). A positive growth of non-pathogenic organisms was observed in contact lens of 9 subjects. Pathogenic organisms were predominantly isolated from lens case (11/24 samples) than in CL (8/24 samples). The subjective comfort rating of dryness and the clinical findings of papillary roughness and meibomitis were higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic CL wearers which was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Surprisingly only 5 samples from symptomatic and 9 samples from asymptomatic CL wearers were identified with pathogenic organisms. Pathogenic organisms namely\nPseudomonas species\nand non pathogenic organism\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\nwere identified in both symptomatic and asymptomatic group. Significant positive correlation (r=0.61, p=0.001) was found between years of lens wear and comfort with lenses and between hours of contact lens wear and with a positive growth of organisms in CL(r=0.44, p=0.02).\n\nConclusion(s):\nBoth pathogenic and non pathogenic microorganisms were isolated in contact lens and lens case samples of a daily wear soft contact lens users.

It provides instruction to ensure the solutions are used safely and effectively, to advise on potential risks and benefits, and to explain what to expect when using these products. The labeling contains sufficient information to describe the device, its intended use, and specific descriptions of the patients for whom the product would not be a good choice. This study examined the various technical questions asked by contact lens patients with regards to their lens care disinfections products.\n\nMethods:\nUnsolicited product questions from consumers to the manufacturer's US Customer Interaction group on approved lens care products are tracked in internal proprietary documentation systems. Unsolicited product inquiries are received from consumers via telephone, fax, email, letter, face-to-face interactions, manufacturer's websites/social media platforms, or forwarded in whole by other departments within the company.\n\nResults:\nData on disinfection lens care products was retrieved from Jan 2015 to Dec 2016 and analyzed among 16 categories. For the hydrogen peroxide and multi-purpose disinfection solutions, top categories of questions asked by consumers were directions for use 27.7%, how products supplied 18.9%, contents 16.3%, indications 11.4%, and storage 9.2%.\n\nConclusion(s):\nCL patients are taking the time to seek information about their lens care products. The unsolicited questions expand our understanding of the types of questions contact lens patients have about their over-the-counter products. This information can guide eye care practitioners and the CL industry to create educational tools to further address commonly asked questions and to help support a successful CL experience.","title":"What Contact Lens Patients Want to Know About Their Disinfection Products","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175367\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Alcon Research, Ltd.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Shannon Harper\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Alcon Research Ltd.

Binocular high contrast high illumination (HCHI) visual acuities (VA) were assessed using LogMAR (VAR Scale) at Distance (D, 6M), Intermediate (I, 1M), and Near (N, 40cm). Stereoacuity was assessed at 40 cm using the Randot E Stereoacuity Test. A visual quality (VQ) questionnaire was completed using a 0=Poor to 100=Excellent analog scale.\n\nResults:\nEight different brands of CNMF soft contact lenses were worn, with the lenses having been worn for 5.6\n+\n4.1 years, with a range of 3 to 19 years. HCHI VAs (D, I, N) were 101.2\n+\n3.5, 83.5\n+\n4.5, 93.8\n+\n4.3. VQ scores (D, I, N) were: 85.0\n+\n8.50, 75.4\n+\n11.9, 59.0\n+\n26.4.

Therefore, the average stereoacuity scores for this population would be substantially worse than reported.\n\nConclusion(s):\nVAs were substantially less than desired 20/20 vision at intermediate and near distances. VQ scores were similar in trend to the VAs, except at 40cm the VQ score was lower than anticipated based on the VA. Stereoacuity was lower than has been previously published for CNMF, especially given the fact that over one-third of the participants could not complete even the grossest measure of stereoacuity on the test. The mismatch between VAs and the stereoacuity at near indicates that VAs are not a good indicator of how well the eyes are working together at near. The observed reductions in visual acuity, visual quality and stereoacuity for long-term wearers of CNMF should be a consideration for both presbyopic and other populations for whom CNMF soft contact lenses may be prescribed.","title":"Impact of Long-Term Wear of Center Near Multifocals on Vision and Stereoacuity","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175368\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Optic disc OCT and ganglion cell analysis are already being used in conjunction with formal visual field testing to monitor patients with visual loss from compressive optic neuropathies. However, the OCT can also be used to predict visual recovery and is frequently requested by neuro-surgeons.\n\nCase Report:\nA 62-year old woman presented for progressive vision loss and double vision. Examination revealed reduced afferent function; BCVA of 20/80 OD/OS with complete temporal field loss bilaterally and early nasal field loss OS>OD. Optic nerve OCT was normal and ganglion cell analysis demonstrated mild nasal thinning OS. Her MRI was consistent with a pituitary tumor and she underwent transsphenoidal resection within 2 days of examination. Three months later, she returned with 20/20 visual acuity and mild superior temporal field defects. She now met legal driving criteria.\nCase 2:\nA 72 year-old man presented for blurry peripheral vision and double vision. Examination revealed BCVA of 20/20- OD and 20/25- OS with a bitemporal field defect. Optic nerve OCT demonstrated moderate temporal thinning OU. Ganglion cell analysis demonstrated binasal loss. MRI demonstrated a craniopharyngioma for which he underwent a transsphenoidal resection 1 month after our examination. Six months later, he returned with stable visual acuity and only mild improvement on his bitemporal field defect. He did not meet legal driving criteria.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOCT is a non-invasive test to evaluate the axonal integrity of the visual pathway. It can be an additional tool to predict visual prognosis in patients with compressive tumors at the chiasm. In patients without RNFL or ganglion cell layer thinning, prompt neuro-surgical intervention could potentially lead to a more significant level of visual improvement compared to patients with moderate/severe thinning at diagnosis.","title":"Chiasmal Compression: Utility of the OCT to Predict Visual Improvement Prior to Surgical Intervention","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175369\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kelly Malloy, Erin Draper\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Bitemporal defects from a lesion of the optic chiasm are typically due to a compressive pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma. This case features a symptomatic bitemporal field defect that led to the surprising discover of a potentially dangerous vascular lesion.\n\nCase Report:\nA 66 year old white female presented with concern of a visual disruption described as a smudge through the central vision of her left eye starting 6 months prior. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Ocular health exam revealed corneal scars from prior radial keratotomy surgery, mild nuclear sclerosis, and otherwise normal intraocular findings. Humphrey Visual Field 24-2 Sita Fast testing revealed a subtle temporal paracentral depression in each eye concerning for a pituitary adenoma. MRI revealed a large aneurysm within the sella and suprasellar cistern, elevating the left side of the pituitary gland and compressing the optic chiasm. The patient was referred to a neurosurgery team, and elected interventional radiological embolization to stabilize the lesion.\n\nConclusion(s):\nSmall intracranial aneurysms rarely cause symptoms, but expansion can result in headache, vision loss, anisocoria, or diplopia depending on proximity to the visual pathway and cranial nerves. Ruptured aneurysms have significant morbidity and mortality risk. Pupil, extraocular motility, or visual abnormalities might be the first indication of an intracranial lesion. This case highlights the value of threshold visual field testing when a patient’s subjective complaint does not correlate with their physical exam findings.

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Angiography (A) is a new, non-invasive imaging technique used to visualize blood flow within the retina, choroid, and ONH. OCTA imaging studies can be useful in diagnosing and monitoring patients with acute NAION.\n\nCase report:\nA 60 YO W M reported an inferior shadow OD for 4 days. His medical health was significant for hypercholesteremia and sleep apnea; both of which he reported were well controlled. His ocular history was unremarkable with the exception of having small ONH OU.  Clinical examination revealed BCVA 20/20 OU; PERRL (+) trace APD OD. Dilated fundus examination revealed edema of the superior ONH consistent with acute NAION. OCT and OCTA revealed significant nerve fiber layer (NFL) edema of the superior optic nerve of the right eye with loss of perfusion to the superior retinal peripapillary capillaries (RCP) and peripapillary choriocapillaris (PPC).  Humphrey Visual Field testing (30-2) revealed a corresponding inferior relative scotoma.  Subsequent imaging studies were performed which showed improvement in NFL thickness and mild and significant re-perfusion of the RCP and PPC, respectively.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusions:\nUsing OCTA a loss of vascular perfusion to the ONH can be easily visualized to assist the diagnosis of acute NAION.  Historically, it has been suggested that the primary vessels affected in NAION are the short posterior ciliary arteries. OCTA allows for visualization of changes in both RCP and PPC in NAION resulting in better understanding the NAION. With serial imaging, improvements in perfusion can be documented. Depending on the extent and duration of the initial non-perfusion, this may be helpful in predicting visual outcomes.","title":"Role of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Angiography (A) in Acute Non-Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175371\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Joseph Stamm\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Contact lens neophytes who were able to wear spherical soft contact lenses were recruited. Subjects who reported or showed signs of ocular surface disease were excluded. Subjects were fit into senofilcon A contact lenses at the baseline visit. If subjects were able to successfully complete insertion and removal training, they were then randomized to either immediate full-time lens wear (8 or more hours/day each day) or gradual wear (2 hours/day on day one with 2 additional hours/day until 8 hours or more/day was achieved). A visual analog scale was used to record end-of-day comfort each day. Masked examiners also performed Schirmer’s test and measured non-invasive tear breakup time (NITBUT), tear meniscus height (TMH), and bulbar redness at each visit. The Mann-Whitney Test was used to analyze between-group differences at each time-point.\n\nResults:\nSix full-time and eight gradual wearers were recruited. The mean age ± SD of the sample was 24.1 ± 2.0 years; the sample was 33.3% female. There were no significant differences between groups at any time point (baseline, 1 week, 2 week) for end-of-day comfort (p = 1.00; p = 0.78; p = 0.88), NITBUT (p = 0.52; p = 0.86; p = 0.30), TMH (p = 0.64; p = 0.44; p = 0.22), bulbar redness (p = 0.48; p = 0.56; p = 1.00), or Schirmer’s test (p = 0.34; p = 0.34; p = 0.15).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThere was little difference in ocular comfort and signs when comparing full-time and gradual wear adaptation schedules in neophyte contact lens wearers. These data suggest that it may not be necessary for prescribers to gradually increase wearing time for neophyte contact lens wearers.","title":"Contact Lens Adaptation in Neophytes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175355\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Erin Rueff, Brad Kubis, Kate McClure, Adam Peiffer, Jeffrey Walline, Andrew Pucker\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Clinical performance of a daily disposable, silicone hydrogel toric (TCL) has previously been investigated. A multi-centre in-market assessment was conducted to identify performance and satisfaction with the TCL in new (NW) & existing (EW) wearers.\n\nMethods:\nThis was a monadic, non-interventional assessment where US practitioners fit patients with a senofilcon A DD TCL. Performance was evaluated via online survey after several days’ wear. Data were collated and analysed post-hoc by an independent market research agency.\n\nResults:\nOf the 1072 patient fit, 341 completed the survey (73 NW, 268 EW). Subject ages were 16-24 years 20.5%, 25-34 yrs 42.8% & 35-44 yrs 36.7%; 67.8% were female. Both groups wore the TCL for 4.2 days (mean, SD1.36). There were significant differences in those agreeing the TCL was comfortable while using digital devices (91.7% EW vs 79.5% NW, p < 0.05) and when worn in challenging environments (air-con/heated; 89.6% vs 74.6%, p < 0.05). When asked if the TCL allowed them to experience clear, consistent vision in those conditions, differences were seen with challenging environments (92.7% vs 84.7%, p < 0.05) but not digital device use (92.5% EW vs 87.7% NW). There were no significant differences in opinion about whether the fit process was simple, quick and easy (97.0% EW agreed, 97.3% NW), the TCL was easy to handle (97.4% EW agreed, 95.9% NW) and vision was consistent regardless of eye or head movements (91.8% vs 87.7%). Both groups agreed they had consistent vision wearing the TCL, (94.0% EW, 87.7% NW) and stable vision with daily activities (92.5% EW, 86.3% NW).\n\nConclusion(s):\nResults show high satisfaction in NW & EW with the TCL.

Ocular sagittal height of 14 participants was evaluated with an eye profiler (Eaglett Eye, The Netherlands). Four different lenses (-200 um, aligned, +200 um and +400 um vs ocular sag @ 14.5mm (lens diameter); monocurve, Definitive material) were then fitted in a random order on both eyes of each subject. Lens were manufactured in the Netherlands (Microlens) and their parameters were checked with an OCT method (Optimec, UK) before and after the experimentation. The lens position and movement were analyzed through a video technique (Aston University, UK), grading movement on push-up (mm) and the amount of drop (mm)  vertical gaze. Masked observers ranked each set of 4 lenses in order, from the least desirable fit to the most optimal one. Comfort was evaluated with a Likert scale at insertion and after 30 minutes of wear.\n\nResults:\nThere was no statistical difference for comfort at insertion (p=0.327) or after 30 minutes (Friedman, p=0.199).  Push-up movement was 0.8 mm (-200um), 0.81 (alligned and +200um), and 0.84 (+400 um) and showed no statistical difference (ANOVA p=0.784) However, the lens drop, when subject was asked to look upward, was near statistical difference (p=0.057) between -200 (0.73 mm), +400 (1.2 mm) and 0 or +200 um (0.82 and 0.83mm).  Masked observers ranked the lens fitted with +200 um optimally centred for 14/28 eyes, and with optimal movement (20/28 eyes)\n\nConclusion(s):\nBased on objective analysis, lenses fitted between 0 and 200 um (vs sag) may be considered optimally fitted. Subjective analysis tends to find lenses  +200um the best option. Soft lenses can be effectively fitted with ocular sag as a reference instead of central curvature of the cornea.","title":"Relationship between Ocular Sagittal Height and Soft Contact Lens Sagittal Depth to Improve Fitting and Comfort","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175357\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Montreal School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Camil Tremblay, Syvlie Gregoire\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Private Practice, Université de Monteal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Soft multifocal contact lenses can be an option for these patients. Since their near acuity may not be compromised, it cannot be used as measurement of fitting success. The purpose of this study is to utilize the “Response AC/A” ratio & the change in near phoria through a 1-day etafilcon A multifocal to determine the near add power actually utilized by non-presbyopic wearers. Von Graefe (VG) & prism cover test (PCT) are compared for their precision in this technique.\n\nMethods:\n19 subjects, 18-35 yrs, with 20/25 or better monocular (D/N) acuity with habitual spectacles, between +/- 10D, & free from active ocular disease were studied. Response AC/A ratio was calculated at 40cm with habitual spectacles. Subjects wore a plano / “low add” etafilcon multifocal (aspheric center near design) under habitual spectacle Rx. 40cm phorias were measured by both VG & PCT. Acuities were taken with this habitual & contact lens combination.\n\nResults:\nDifferences between Von Graefe & Prism Cover Test were examined using paired t-tests (2-tailed; α=0.05). There was no significant difference between VG & PCT in calculating multifocal add utilization (p>.05). While wearing the “low add” & habitual combination, all subjects maintained 20/25 or better acuity at distance. 80% of subjects become more exophoric at near with the contact lens, showing that they were utilizing the multifocal correction. The subjects that responded to the +1.00D add, accepted 1/3D on average & ranged to the full +1.00D. Some subjects didn’t utilize plus at near.\n\nConclusion(s):\nUtilizing the subjects’ Response AC/A ratio & near phoria, clinicians can quickly determine those non-presbyopes that would benefit from multifocal contact lenses & the add required. Von Graefe & Prism Cover Test are equally valid in these calculations.","title":"Fitting Daily Multifocal Contact Lenses for Near Point Problems in Non- Presbyopes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175358\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Meagan Miles, William Edmondson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry, Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of the current post-hoc analysis was to characterise the kinetics of the pre-contact lens lipid layer (LL) over the interblink period (IB) from eye opening (EO) to spontaneous blinking (SB) after the initial three hours of wear of daily disposable (DD) contact lenses.\n\nMethods:\nHabitual DAILIES®TOTAL1® (delefilcon A) (DT1 n=44) DD wearers were tested with their habitual lenses, with ACUVUE® OASYS® (senofilcon A) (AO) and ACUVUE® OASYS® 1-DAY (senofilcon A) (AO1D) lenses used on a DD modality for a period of 10±2 days. LL visible pattern and thickness after three hours of wear were quantified.\n\nResults:\nAt least two LL patterns, representing different LL thicknesses, were recorded in the majority of cases and the occurrence of more than one pattern increased during the interblink period: at least 2 patterns (EO:59.8%; SB:84.1%) of which at least 3 patterns (EO:11.0%%; SB:50.4%). The primary LL classification was significantly different (p =0.024 to < 0.001) between DT1, for which the classification was in the majority of cases average or thick (EO:59.1%; SB:53.4%) and AO (EO:32.9%; SB:23.9%) or AO1D (EO:40.9%; SB:36.4%) for which the same classification was in the minority. LL thickness whereas decreasing on average (EO=23.0nm SB=21.6nm; p=0.029) showed limited correlation between EO and SB (EO vs. SB r=0.516); the variability appeared to be contact lens dependent: DT1 strong (r=0.766), AO moderate (r=0.440) and AO1D weak (r=0.284).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe pre-contact lens LL varies topographically and over time during the IB, hence the LL needs to be analysed over the entire contact lens visible area and the full IB. Lens material seems to influence LL pattern and thickness and it is postulated that the material surface properties may influence the spreading of a thick LL.","title":"Daily Disposable Contact Lenses Pre-Contact Lens Lipid Layer Kinetics","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175360\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ocular Technology Group-International\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kishan Patel, Ruchi Gupta, Trisha Patel, Panos Theodoratos, Cecile Maissa\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ocular Technology Group - International, Ocular Technology Group - International, Ocular Technology Group - International, Ocular Technology Group - International, Alcon Research Ltd Johns Creek GA\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The new algorithm allows for the evaluation of the optical performance of multifocal contact lenses in combination with any given subject’s optical higher order aberrations. It also allows to compute the optical properties of the multifocal contact lenses for any desired pupil size. The algorithm was tested on a population of 65 subjects with pupil diameters ranging between 2 and 6 mm. The higher order aberrations from this subjects were combined with the optical profiles of three designs from Johnson and Johnson (Oasys lenses) with low, middle, and high levels of addition.  These simulations were repeated for the optical profiles of lenses that also corrected three levels refractive error (-6 D, -3 D, and +1 D). The optical profiles of the Oasys lenses obtained from the NIMO instrument were translated to their corresponding wavefronts by locally segmenting the pupil.  Two values were obtained to compare the optical properties of the multifocal designs: the area under the through focus (aVSOTF), and the interval of acceptable quality through focus (IATF).\n\nResults:\nThe optical performance of the commercial designs are highly modified by the presence of higher order aberrations. The optical performance of the studied designs is: Oasys H (aVSOTF=0.9, IAQTF=2.3), Oasys M (aVSOTF=0.77, IAQTF=2.1), and the Oasys L (aVSOTF=0.82, IAQTF=1.9). And, is comparable to the one produced by a monofocal lens (aVSOTF=1, IAQTF=2.15).\n\nConclusion(s):\nA new method to evaluate the optical profiles of multifocal contact lenses has been presented. With this method it is possible to observe how designs for old presbyopes - Oasis H - spread the VSOTF across around 2.5 D through focus. The peak performance of these designs, however, is lower than the one obtained for lenses that are used by young presbyopes – Oasys L. Designs intended for young presbyopes do not extend the VSOTF more than 2 D but do conserve a higher peak performance that young presbyopes move through focus by using the residual accommodation they still conserve.","title":"Optical Properties of Commercial Multifocal Contact Lenses When Combined with the Higher Order Aberrations of 65 Eyes with Varying Pupil Sizes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175363\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Chicago College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Our purpose was to investigate how Air Optix Colors affects a patient’s field of vision. Based on lens design we hypothesized the lenses would cause a restriction in the visual field of subjects. This study was done using Goldmann perimetry to compare the visual fields of patients wearing Air Optix Colors to the visual fields with no lens.\n\nMethods:\nTwenty-two subjects were fit with a brown Air Optix Colors lens on the right eye. Each subject performed a visual field with and without the lens. The order was randomized. Three isopters were measured with Goldmann bowl perimetry with three different targets using standard Goldmann procedures. Eight axes were assessed for each isopter. The same process was repeated with no lens. The area was calculated for each isopter for both no lens and the colored lens trials. The area of all like-isopters were averaged and compared across both conditions and the percent change determined.\n\nResults:\nA statistically significant decrease of all three isopters on Goldmann perimetry was found.

We compared two different intraocular pressure (IOP) measuring devices over the top of 3 kinds of bandage contact lenses to determine which if not both were viable options. We also set a range for central corneal thickness (CCT) as it affects IOP readings between devices with RTVue OCT.\n\nMethod:\n30 healthy subjects recruited from the student population of Southern College of optometry were gathered for a total of 60 eyes. A baseline pachymetry/CCT measurement using RTVue OCT was taken OUfor all subjects, Eyes were randomly assigned to Acuvue Oasys, Biofinity CL’s or Air Optix Night & Day CL’s. The prescription range was plano to -0.50 D. Each patient was given the same brand OU. IOP was measured via iCare and Tonopen. Initial measurement was recorded pre-bandage CL’s with Tonopen on all right (OD) eyes and iCare on all left (OS) eyes and 10 minutes post-instillation of bandage CL’s.\n\nResults:\nPaired t-test and Wilcoxon Sign-Rank were performed on the mean differences and standard deviations of IOP of both instruments. IOP measured via Tonopen (OD) was not significantly different (p = 0.17) when measured over CL versus without. Mean pressure w/o CL was 15.87 mmHg (SD =2.29) while over CL was 15.30 mmHg (SD = 2.59). Significantly higher intraocular pressure values were observed using iCare (OS) over CL compared to without. Mean iCare w/o CL was 14.97 mmHg (SD = 3.21) and 15.70 mmHg (SD = 3.83). Although statistically different, the distributions were similar.\n\nConclusion(s):\nBoth instruments were found to be viable options for taking IOP over bandage CL. The IOP fluctuation was not statistically significant for the Tonopen measurements, but was statistically significant for the iCare measurements. However, given the small standard deviation, the iCare measurements are likely not clinically significant meaning both iCare and Tonopen accurately measure IOP over top of bandage CL’s.","title":"Two Forms of Tonometry Over Three Types of FDA-Approved Bandage Contact Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175352\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Christopher Borgman, Michael Christensen\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry, Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

To quantify changes in the PLTF on contact lens surfaces differing in material composition. To assess possible visual effects of PLTF changes during the course of a 6 hour period using high and low contrast visual acuity.\n\nMethods:\n5 clinically normal subjects were fit into 2 contact lens designs, delefilcon A and etafilcon A. Lipid layer thickness measurements of the PCTF were acquired using the Stroboscopic Video Color Microscope prior to lens insertion. The PLTF was assessed 15 minutes after lens insertion, and after 6 hours of lens wear. High and low contrast logMAR acuities were measured at each time interval. Average lipid layer thickness and logMAR acuity were averaged between the right and left eye and compared using paired t-tests.\n\nResults:\nA trend towards decreased lipid layer thickness was found after 6 hours of contact lens wear when compared to the baseline PCTF, -6.2 ± 7.7 nm (p = 0.14) in delefilcon A and -9.6 ± 13.8 nm (p = 0.19) in etafilcon A. From 15 minutes to 6 hours of contact lens wear, there was an average decrease in lipid layer thickness of -3.0 ± 7.9 nm (p = 0.44) in delefilcon A and -9.2 ± 14.8 nm (p = 0.24) in etafilcon A. After 6 hours in delefilcon A, there was no significant change in high (p = 0.24) or low contrast (p = 0.11) logMAR acuity. After 6 hours in etafilcon A, there was no difference in high contrast acuity (p=0.41), but a significant decrease in low contrast acuity, 0.10 ± 0.6 logMAR (p = 0.02).\n\nConclusion(s):\nOcular surface imaging is useful in assessing tear film dynamics associated with contact lens wear, where quantifiable changes in lipid layer thickness can be identified over the course of a wearing cycle. Low contrast acuity may be a more sensitive marker than high contrast acuity for vision changes associated with PLTF dynamics.","title":"Ocular Surface Imaging to Assess Tear Film Dynamics Associated with Contact Lens Wear","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175353\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        P.

It's known that CLs can cause corneal warpage with up to 70% of CL wearers experiencing lens-induced astigmatism1-3. It's important to monitor corneal changes in pediatric CL wearers due to the amblyopia risk. This case presents a child with Alagille syndrome and CL-induced corneal warpage from a soft toric CL.\n\nCase Report:\nA child with Alagille syndrome presented for evaluation of corneal changes and decreased VA. Her records show myopic astigmatism and VA of 20/25. She was wearing a soft sphere CL in her right eye (OD) and toric in her left eye (OS). Her OS had an irregular retinoscopy reflex, 3D hyperopic shift, and VA of 20/40. Slit lamp exam OS revealed a tight CL and punctate keratitis. Topography was normal OD and irregular OS with an area of steepening not unlike keratoconus. She was diagnosed with corneal warpage from a tight fitting CL with a differential diagnosis of keratoconus or other corneal ectasias. She was asked to stop CL wear, start frequent artificial tears, and was seen monthly. Her most recent VA was 20/25. Topography now shows symmetric, normal corneal contour.\n\nConclusion(s):\nCorneal warpage is a known complication of CL wear. It’s thought to occur with RGPs, but can also affect soft CL wearers2. Alagille syndrome affects the liver, lungs, heart, and eyes5. It is unclear whether her syndrome was related to the corneal changes. Posterior embryotoxon is a known finding with Alagille syndrome but no other corneal irregularities have been described. This patient didn’t experience any issues OD therefore the corneal warpage may have been caused by a difference in modulus or base curve of the toric lens.  Corneal warpage can be caused by a tight fitting soft CL and can mimic corneal changes in conditions like keratoconus6,7. Optometrists should be aware of this to avoid misdiagnosis and amblyopia in children.","title":"Soft Toric Contact Lens Induced Corneal Warpage in a Patient with Alagille Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175354\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

One may assume that if CL wearers’ hands are contaminated with pathogens, the risk for developing MK and CIEs increases. Past studies show that some CL wearers are not compliant with hand washing procedures. This study evaluated hand washing and drying of patients prior to inserting CLs, and assessed beliefs about transferring bacteria to eyes during CL insertion.\n\nMethods:\nA CooperVision-sponsored Internet survey was conducted by Decision Analyst, an independent marketing research service, from April 19 - May 1, 2017.  Self-described 1 day CL (1dCL) wearers, 14 years or older and living in the U.S., were surveyed. The sample was drawn from Decision Analyst’s American Consumer Opinion® panel and the agency’s trusted partner panels.\n\nResults:\nA total of 950 patients were surveyed (63% female and 37% male, average age 35 years). Geographic distribution of respondents was 25% Northeast, 22% Midwest, 36% South, and 17% West. With respect to hand hygiene practices, 41% of 1dCL wearers do not wash their hands with soap immediately before insertion, 15% rarely or never wash their hands or do so without soap, and 65% do not utilize a sanitary drying option after washing their hands. Eighty-eight per cent of 1dCL wearers believe that bacteria on their fingers can transfer to their eyes during lens insertion, with 86% indicating the amounts of bacteria are ‘A little’ to ‘some’, and 7% indicating ‘A lot’.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis study provides more evidence that many CL wearers do not wash and/or dry their hands hygienically prior to lens insertion, despite believing that they are transferring bacteria to their eyes. This suggests that in addition to hand washing and education, other strategies are needed to employ preventive measures that minimize microbial contamination of CLs.","title":"Hand Washing Behavior of 1 Day Contact Lens Wearers","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175345\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        CooperVision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Desmond Fonn, Aldo Zucaro\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Consultant, CooperVision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study evaluated the feasibility of a novel clinical test method for assessing the rotational stability of a widely prescribed TCL design during natural wearing conditions.\n\nMethods:\nTwelve subjects were fitted bilaterally with a TCL featuring printed white fiducial markings and plano optics for a minimum of 5 hours wear. At 30 minute intervals, subjects were instructed to photograph each eye using a smartphone (iPhone 6 Plus) fitted with a macro lens attachment (Olloclip Macro Pro 7x Lens) and a custom 3D printed eyecup. Images from each timepoint were analyzed to determine the angle of the fiducial markings relative to the intercanthal angle using custom a written software application in MATLAB. The distribution of lens rotational data was investigated and quantified using descriptive statistics.\n\nResults:\nIn total, 273 images from both eyes of 11 subjects were analyzed. Photographs for both eyes of one subject were excluded due to poor image quality. TCL rotation data appeared to be normally distributed. For each eye, rotational stability was quantified by calculating the standard deviation of the total set of data points for that eye. Standard deviations range from 0.91° to 5.4° with a mean of 2.4°, inferring a 95% prediction interval of approximately ± 5° for an average eye.\n\nConclusion(s):\nA novel clinical test method was successfully used to investigate TCL rotational stability during natural wearing conditions. The TCL design used in this study demonstrated good rotational stability throughout the wear period.

Numerous studies have indicated that poor compliance including hand hygiene is a common problem. To minimize the lens bioburden introduced by contact lens handling, we evaluated the effect of a natural, biologically derived compound ¿-poly-L-lysine (¿-PL) in the packaging solution on contamination of three lens materials in the presence of tear film components.\n\nMethods:\nSingle-masked studies compared a test lens (stenfilcon A, omafilcon A, somofilcon A) packaged in blister solution containing e-PL at 100mg/mL against the same lens  with no compound (control). Up to 20 subjects handled each contact lens in a manner mimicking routine lens removal from the blister pack. Handled lenses were collected in either saline (PBS) or artificial tear (AT) solution and left for a total of 30 minutes prior to plating, simulating the on-eye residence time of e-PL under the lens. Bioburden was expressed as the mean of colony forming units transformed log\n10\n(\n+\nstandard error).  Log\n10\nreduction (LR) was calculated as a difference between log\n10\ncontrol and test lens and reported in addition to percent reduction (PR). Two-tailed Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis.\n\nResults:\nLenses packed in the test solution had lower microbial count than lenses packed in the control solution. Statistically significant LR was observed for all lens types in PBS (omafilcon A LR=1.7, PR=95%, stenfilcon A LR=0.9, PR=89%, somofilcon A LR=1.0, PR=90%; p\n<\n0.001 for all). Importantly, a statistically significant reduction was still present when lenses were placed in AT solution (omafilcon A LR=0.8, PR=62%, p=0.005; stenfilcon A LR=0.9, PR=73%, p=0.025; somofilcon A LR=0.7, PR=82%, p=0.0006).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThese pilot studies demonstrate that e-PL, a novel compound in the blister pack solution, can reduce bioburden introduced by lens handling on three different lens surfaces in the presence of tear film components.","title":"The Effect of a Novel Contact Lens Blister Pack Solution on Bacterial Contamination of Various Soft Contact Lens Materials during Lens Handling","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175347\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carol Morris, Andrew Luk\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        CooperVision Inc., CooperVision Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Specifically, the kinetic friction between a 5 micron diameter colloidal silica probe and three commerical SiHy lotrafilcon B lenses packaged in sterile saline(O2 Optix (O2)), sterile saline including copolymer 845 (Air Optix Aqua (AOA), and sterile saline including copolymer 845 + block copolymer EOBO-41 (Air Optix plus Hydraglyde (AOHG)), was measured as a function of simulated wear time.\n\nMethods:\nFriction values were recorded immediately upon removal from the pack and at specific time points following gentle agitation in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solutions at 34°C, free of comfort agents. Agitation, intended to mimic on eye wear, entailed a swirling saline solution, oscillating over the surface of the lenses for periods of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 20 hours, evaluating each time point with a unique lens and taking 3 measurements per lens.\n\nResults:\nBased on out of pack measurements, the friction of the lenses can be rank ordered O2 > AOA > AOHG, correlated with the presence of the comfort agents present in the respective packing solutions (none, copolymer 845, copolymer 845 plus ethylene oxide butylene oxide (EOBO) copolymer). In general, substantivity measurements demonstrated an increase in friction with agitation time; however, a greater substantivity was observed for AOHG (only 20% increase in friction) as compared to AOA (50% increase over 20 hours). It was also demonstrated that retreatment of the AOHG lens with EOBO-41 copolymer in lens care solution following 20 hours agitation serves to return friction to out of pack levels.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThese results depict the benefit of comfort agents found within packing solutions of certain silicone hydrogel lenses with respect to friction and demonstrate superior substantivity of the EOBO-41 copolymer.","title":"Retention of Packing Solution Comfort Agents","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175349\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Alcon Laboratories, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Scott Perry, Xueying Zhao\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Florida, University of Florida\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Habitual EA lenses were evaluated at the first visit and then subjects were re-fitted with FA lenses, with the same power as their EA lenses, for 4-weeks of daily wear. Subjects used the same lens care regimen – Opti-Free® PureMoist® MPS. Follow-up evaluations were conducted at 1, 2, and 4-weeks.\n\nResults:\nThirty-five habitual EA contact lens wearers aged 18 to 39 (mean ± SD: 24.1 ± 5.5 years), were enrolled and 34 completed the study. FA lenses were rated better for overall comfort than the AE lenses at 1-week (8.9 ± 1.1 vs. 8.0 ± 0.9, p = 0.003), 2-weeks (9.0 ± 0.8 vs. 8.0 ± 0.9, p = 0.000), and 4-weeks (8.9 ± 0.9 vs. 8.0 ± 0.9, p = 0.000). Overall dryness ratings were better with the FA lenses than habitual EA lenses at 1-week (8.8 ± 1.1 vs. 7.9 ± 1.3, p = 0.021), 2-weeks (8.9 ± 1.1 vs. 7.9 ± 1.3, p = 0.005), and 4-weeks (8.8 ± 0.9 vs. 7.9 ± 1.3, p = 0.005). FA lenses were rated better for ease of handling than AE lenses at 2-weeks (9.6 ± 0.8 vs. 8.9 ± 1.4, p = 0.029) and 4-weeks (9.6 ± 0.7 vs. 8.9 ± 1.4, p = 0.016). Subjects were more satisfied than dissatisfied with the comfort of the FA lenses for the whole follow-up period (p < 0.05). FA lenses were more preferred for comfort and overall performance than the EA lenses at each visit (p < 0.05). After 4-weeks of wear, 94% of subjects reported that they were very likely / likely to switch to the FA lenses.\n\nConclusion(s):\nFA lenses provided excellent comfort and higher levels of satisfaction than the subject’s habitual EA lenses after a simple refit and 4-weeks of daily wear. Further work is needed to identify the complex interplay between key contact lens material properties and clinical outcomes.","title":"Subjective Assessments of Habitual Wearers of Enfilcon A Sphere Lenses Following a Direct Refit with Fanfilcon A Sphere Lenses for 4 Weeks","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175350\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        CooperVision, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Gary Orsborn, Robert Montés-Micó\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        CooperVision Inc., University of Valencia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Before lens wear, LLT was measured by LipiView interferometer while NITBUT and TFSQ were measured by Medmont E300 corneal topographer. Subjects were fitted contralaterally with Etafilcon A (EA), Stenfilcon A (SA), or Delefilcon A (DA) lenses according to a pre-determined randomization scheme. NITBUT & TFSQ were repeated after insertion and 6 hours of wear.\n\nResults:\n30 subjects (15 Sx: 23 ± 4 years of age; 15 ASx: 22 ± 3 years of age) participated. No difference was observed between ASx & Sx groups in baseline LLT (68 ± 16 nm vs. 65 ± 20 nm, p = 0.91) and NITBUT (9.1 ± 4.9 s vs. 8.7 ± 5.7 s, p = 0.21) prior to lens wear. For Asx group, there was a statistical difference in NIBUT between DA & SA at insertion (4.7 ± 3.2 vs. 3.6 ± 2.1, p = 0.04), but not at 6 hrs (4.1 ± 1.7 vs. 3.5 ± 1.7, p = 0.16), and no difference was observed between the other lens pairs at any time points, while Sx group showed no difference between any lens pair at any time (p > 0.05 all). For TFSQ, ASx group showed a statistical difference at insertion between EA and SA (0.3 ± 0.2 vs. 0.4 ± 0.2, p = 0.03) and DA and SA (0.3 ± 0.2 vs. 0.4 ± 0.2, p = 0.03), while no difference was observed between lens pairs at any time points. Sx showed no difference in TFSQ values for any lens pair at any time point (p > 0.05 all).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe discernable differences were detected in pre-lens tear-film dynamics between lens types for ASx lens wearers after lens insertion, while no difference was observed in Sx counter parts. The observed difference at lens insertion but not at 6-hour lens wear suggests that innate tear film components interaction with lens-material could mask the differences in lens surface properties, according results of our previous studies. Further research is needed to understand how other pre-existing ocular parameters influence tear-film dynamics over soft contact lenses.","title":"Tear-Film Stability in Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Subjects Before and After Wearing Daily Disposable Hydrogel and Silicone Hydrogel Contact Lenses.","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175351\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        CooperVision, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Tan Truong, Antonio López Alemany, Meng Lin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UC Berkeley School of Optometry, University of Valencia Optometry & Vision Sciences, UC Berkeley School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

But, it is vital to consider other causes, such as topical meds. Early recognition of drug-induced cicatricial ectropion and removing the inciting agent may result in resolution and prevent surgery.\n1\n\nCase Report:\nOn January 23, 2017, an 88-year old male presented to clinic with a complaint of tearing and outward turning of his left lower eyelid for one week. He discontinued his eye meds two days prior. Anterior segment findings showed outward turning of lower lid with periorbital dermatitis and hyperemia. His intraocular pressure (IOP) was 17 OU.  He had hypertension, vascular dementia, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was taking losartan, lasix, ASA 81mg and finasteride.  His ocular history was significant for moderate primary open angle glaucoma OS worse than OD. Before stopping his topical meds, he was on latanoprost qhs OU and timolol bid OU since April 2013, which kept his IOP in low-teens until December 2015, when the left eye spiked to 20, so patient was put on brimonidine tid OS.  Because patient had unilateral ectropion OS, patient was advised to stop brimonidine and start erythromycin bid OS. He also restarted latanoprost qhs OU. Patient returned in two weeks with marked improvement of ectropion and symptoms and his IOP was reduced to 11 OU.\nConclusion(s):\nAlthough involutional is the most common type, consider topical drug-induced cicatricial ectropion in patients using topical meds.  Drug-induced cicatricial ectropion tend to occur in older patients with lid laxity, which makes them prone to lid malposition in the setting of chronic mechanical change due to allergic etiology of the topical agent.\n1,2\nEarly recognition and removal of the topical agent can result in reversible skin changes and ultimately, resolution of ectropion to prevent surgical intervention.","title":"Treatment of Drug-Induced Ectropion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175336\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kimberly Pham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Complications due to poor positioning or inappropriate IOL diameter include corneal decompensation, uveitis, hyphema, and secondary glaucoma. Rare cases of scleral perforation have been reported in association with ocular trauma, incorrect IOL size, or chronic inflammation.\n\nCase Report:\nA 67 year old black female presented with new onset right eye discomfort. She was seen frequently over the past year for episodes of blepharitis, relieved with topical steroids. Ocular history also included complex cataract removal with ACIOL placement in the right eye in 2007, and IOL re-positioning in 2011. Visual acuity, entrance testing and intraocular pressure were stable from prior exam. Anterior segment exam revealed the superior ACIOL haptic footplate extruding through the sclera and conjunctiva. The was no Seidel sign. Besivance was administered and a fox shield placed until the patient could be transferred to a corneal surgeon. Urgent surgery was performed to tuck the IOL back through the conjunctiva and scleral tunnel, which were fastened with nylon sutures. The wound was Seidel positive for several days, and stabilized by one week with the use of topical aqueous suppressants and antibiotics.\n\nDiscussion:\nSpontaneous exposure of an ACIOL is rare. Presumed triggers include chronic inflammation, oversized IOL, and ocular trauma. This patient’s history of prior ACIOL malposition and adjustment likely compromised the scleral and conjunctival integrity. Ocular surface inflammation from allergy or blepharitis has been reported in other cases of IOL extrusion, and this patient had similarly been treated for recurrent blepharitis with topical steroids. Patients with ACIOL and chronic ocular inflammation should be monitored for evidence of scleral thinning.","title":"Rare Late Complication of Anterior Chamber Intraocular Lens Placement","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175337\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

CE can be isolated or accompanied by anterior segment inflammation. Repeat inflammation to the corneal endothelium can lead to corneal decompensation which can be visually significant. Specular microscopy is a quick and noninvasive modality for quantitative and qualitative imaging of the corneal endothelium.\n\nCase Report:\nTwo cases of patients presenting with unilateral anterior uveitis were imaged with a specular microscope. Neither patient reported a history of uveitis, signs and/or symptoms consistent with uveitis prior to the current episode, or ocular surgery. Both patients reported unilateral redness, pain, and light sensitivity for several days. The patients were evaluated with slit lamp biomicroscopy and no signs of CE were noted. No corneal scarring or corneal edema was appreciated. Goldmann applanation tonometry was asymmetric in both patients, with the affected eye having lower pressure. Specular microscopy revealed unilateral pseudo-guttata but no significant differences in corneal thickness were noted. No corneal dysfunction was noted in the fellow eye of either patient. The patients were treated with topical steroids and asked to follow up accordingly. Specular microscopy and slit lamp biomicroscopy was repeated at the follow up visit. Anterior chamber inflammation had decreased and no changes in the cornea were appreciated. Specular microscopy revealed improvement in corneal endothelial structure and stable corneal thickness. The patients were treated and followed up as needed.\n\nConclusion(s):\nCE is easily visualized with specular microscopy. Though considered a rare entity, CE may be more common than previously thought. Further investigation into this relationship is necessary to elucidate the pathophysiology of uveitis and CE.","title":"Subclinical Corneal Endotheliitis in Uveitis as Visualized by Specular Microscopy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175338\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects took 3-5 photos for 4 days to capture moments revolving around their TCL. At the end of each day, they uploaded the photos and responded to a survey via their smartphone.\n\nResults:\n30 binocular astigmatic patients wearing TCL (15 US 15 Singapore, 10 daily disposable 20 reusable, mix of brands) participated. 381 moments were captured. Of those moments, 317 (83%) were MOD with their lenses. Evaluation of the 317 MOD revealed six themes: Lens Shifting (47), Blurred Vision (54), Lens Awareness (123), Light Effects (23), Eye Dryness (148), and Irritation (80). Specific MOD contributed to multiple themes. From the 317 MOD captured, 243 (76%) moments were accompanied with a compensating behavior. Examples include: squinting, blinking, using rewetting drops, producing tears to lubricate their lens, physically repositioning their lens, removing and cleaning their lens. No patient visited their Eye Care Professional (ECP) to address these issues.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe study’s results show that some astigmatic patients live with MOD. Some TCL wearers are dealing with a compromised experience and use compensating behaviors to get by. However, they do not seek the advice of their ECP. ECP should be aware of this and probe TCL patients for these behaviors and if needed change lens brand or adjust the lens to maximize patient success.","title":"The Astigmatic Patient’s Moments of Disruption with Their Soft Toric Contact Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175340\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Giovanna Olivares\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Johnson & Johnson Vision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Data were collected with habitual SiHy (control) lenses at baseline and after 4 weeks of etMF DD wear, each after 6 hours of wear. Binocular distance and near LogMAR visual acuities (VAs) were measured. Ocular physiology was assessed for objective limbal/bulbar hyperaemia (Oculus K5M), central and peripheral corneal thickness (Visante™ OCT), subjective grading of upper lid margin staining (ULMS) and corneal staining (CS). Participants rated overall vision and comfort.\n\nResults:\nThe mean age (SD) was 54.5 (± 7.1) years. Successful fitting was achieved in 95% of subjects with ≤ 4 etMF CLs, with 54% requiring 2 CLs only (1/eye). The least-square mean (LSM) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of distance LogMAR VAs were -0.07 (-0.10, -0.04) with habitual SiHy and -0.07 (-0.11, -0.04) with etMF.

Participants completed questionnaires for general history, outdoor activity, outdoor protective measures, and for dry eyes using the OSDI© and SPEED©. Conjunctival UVAF images were obtained using a Nikon D7000 camera system that was adapted with appropriate flash and filter system. Images were acquired of temporal and nasal conjunctiva. For contact lens wearing participants, images were first captured while wearing lenses, and again following lens removal. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software. For each image, the area of UVAF was carefully measured twice and an average was taken. Comparison of UVAF area was made between the three groups.\n\nResults:\nParticipants were 68.2% female, 31.8% male (mean age 24.3 ± 2.5 years). No significant differences in age, gender, or questionnaire results were present between groups. Data was analyzed by non-parametric methods, as it was found to be non-normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk). While no significant UVAF differences were found between Alcon® and JJVC® lens wearers, a significantly higher amount of UVAF was found in JJVC® wearers following lens removal when compared with non-contact lens wearers (p = 0.02), as determined by the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\nConclusion(s):\nContrary to our hypothesis, data from this study supports conjunctival UVAF is increased for UV-absorbing contact lens wearers. It is possible the UV-absorbing material increases conjunctival UV effects while protecting the cornea from UV radiation. Implications for the ocular surface remain to be determined.","title":"Effect of UV-Absorbing Contact Lenses on Conjunctival Ultraviolet Autofluorescence","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175343\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kristina Haworth\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Prior studies have reported on the presence of an increased inflammatory response associated with dry eye. There are many subjective and objective tests available to identify dry eye at different stages and quantify the same. There is not much information available on the presence of inflammatory markers in young adults with different stages of dry eye. Thus, the aim of the present study is to quantify the presence of inflammatory markers and its correlation to objective and subjective assessment of dry eye in young adults who might exhibit milder dry eye.\n\nMethods:\nTears were collected using a surgical sponge and then centrifuged and extracted into a vial. Samples were collected from all the subjects in a single visit, frozen and tested for the presence and magnitude of IL-RA, IL-1B, IL-6 and IL-8. Tear break up time (TBUT) was assessed and subjects completed a SPEED dry eye questionnaire.\n\nResults:\n27 subjects participated in the study that included 13 women and 14 men. TBUT scores less than 10 was considered dry eye. Seventeen subjects had dry eye and 10 served as age matched controls. Subjective symptoms based on SPEED questionnaire was significantly different (p=0.01) between dry eye (mean=11.7) and controls (mean=7.5). Symptoms also correlated inversely with TBUT (r=-0.44, p=0.01) and were higher in women than men (p < 0.01). TBUT scores were higher in men (p=0.03). IL-RA was significantly higher in dry eye subjects than controls (p=0.04). Other inflammatory markers were not significantly different due to the presence of mild dry eye in most of the subjects.\n\nConclusion(s):\nCertain Inflammatory markers like IL-Ra are higher in dry eye subjects than controls even in young subjects. SPEED questionnaire served as a good screening tool to differentiate dry eye from control in young adults with less dry eye. Women are more susceptible to dry eye signs and symptoms at a much younger age.","title":"Presence of Inflammatory Markers in Young Adults with Dry Eye","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175332\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Vinay Nagaraj, Kevin Helmuth\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

A battery of clinical tests was used to characterize the subjects. These included symptom questionnaires, fluorescein tear breakup time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining, gland secretion quality, gland atrophy and Schirmer I without anesthetic. The TearLabTM system was used to assign the subjects’ osmolarity. Subjects were assigned randomly to the model-building and model-testing groups. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine cut-points based on criteria other than the test under consideration.\n\nResults:\nA total of 186 subjects completed the study; 88 normals, 79 MGDs and 19 ADDEs. For combined drys vs. normals relative to symptom surveys, ROC curves were minimally discriminatory (AUCs of 0.670, 0.663 and 0.654 for Schein, OSDI and MGD-Specific, respectively). TBUT demonstrated excellent discrimination with AUC of 0.810, cut-point of 5.2 seconds, sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.71. Upon cross-validation, TBUT correctly identified 26 of 20 drys (sensitivity of 0.90) and 37 of 50 normals (specificity of 0.74). Osmolarity ROC (25 normals vs. 30 drys) yielded an AUC of 0.717 (acceptable discrimination), cut-point of 311 mosm, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.63 and 0.80, respectively.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOf the typical clinical tests, only TBUT appears efficacious as a stand-alone diagnostic test for dry eye, with osmolarity providing acceptable test efficacy. To reliably diagnose dry eye, a test battery that includes the global tests (symptoms, TBUT and staining) in conjunction with specific tests to identify either MGD (e.g., secretion quality, gland atrophy) or ADDE (Schirmer I sans anesthetic) are necessary.","title":"Test Efficacy of Common Clinical Tests in the Diagnosis of Dry Eye","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175333\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jerry Paugh, Tiffany Nguyen, Andrew Loc-Nguyen\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Marshall B Ketchum University, Marshall B Ketchum University, California State University Fullerton\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The Oculus Keratograph 5M measures the tear break-up time without the need of fluorescein, nor observation by a practitioner. Two results are provided: the time it takes for any part of the tear layer to begin to break-up and the average tear break-up time as measured across multiple zones of the cornea. This study looked at the Keratograph 5M to see how repeatable the different tear break-up measurements were and how they compared to one another.\n\nMethods:\nThe tear film stability of 190 eyes was measured using the Keratograph Oculus 5M. The first tear-break up time (tbut-first) and the multi-zonal tear break-up average were completed, then each eye was re-measured twice more with those same tests.\n\nResults:\nOn 190 eyes, the mean (SD) TBUT-first scores for three consecutive measurements were 8.1 (6.8), 8.9 (6.7) and 10.7 (6.4) secs. Mean (SD) multi-zonal (avg) TBUT scores for three consecutive measurements were 10.7 (6.1), 11.2 (6.3) and 12.5 (6.1) secs. There was no significant difference between measurement 1 and 2, but the third measurement was significantly larger (p < 0.01) regardless of which method was used. Between the two metrics, the multi-zonal (avg) TBUT was significantly larger than the TBUT-first (p < 0.01). The coefficient of variability of subsequent measurements for both TBUT-first and the multi-zonal (avg) TBUT was not significantly different.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThere appears to be no significant difference in the repeatability of the tear break up scores with the Oculus 5M regardless if one uses TBUT-first or the multi-zonal (avg) TBUT. However, regardless of which method is employed, one should not measure the TBUT more than twice. Introducing a third measurement in both cases caused a significantly different result, presumably due to reflex tearing.","title":"The Repeatability of Tear Break-Up Time as Measured by the Oculus 5M Keratograph","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175334\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Tyler Jevne, Thomas Gall\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Three time intervals were evaluated; A) time-to-peak temperature (TTPT) interval; B) therapeutic interval (38-42°C); C) return-to-ambient temperature (RTAT) interval. Each mask was evaluated three times in a randomised fashion. A single facecloth (FC) and Bundle Method (BM) were used as controls.\n\nResults:\nThe TTPT interval was < 6 min for most masks with the exception of the EyeGiene (15 min) and the BM (10 min). All masks, except the TheraPearl, reached the therapeutic interval at different times, and maintained it for an average of 5 minutes, while the FC lasted only 3 min. The TheraPearl was just shy of the desired temperature reaching 36°C within 2 min. All masks had a long (115-120 min) RTAT interval with the exception of the FC (20 min) and the BM (25 min). The peak temperature of the innermost towels of the BM was increasingly warmer than its outer counterparts and the overall temperature remained within the therapeutic interval throughout the changes of the 6 towels used. The DERM with a moistened liner lost heat more quickly than without a liner.\n\nConclusion(s):\nContemporary eyelid warming masks are effective at reaching the therapeutic interval quickly and for at least 5 minutes, with the exception of the FC heated only once. The BM was able to retain heat longer and can be a viable alternative to the FC. The EyeGeine took longer to reach peak temperature, however maintained it for a longer time and does not require a microwave, which makes it suitable for travel. Clinical studies are underway to evaluate the mask intervals in vivo.","title":"Heat Intervals of Eyelid Warming Masks","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175325\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Etty Bitton\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        École d'Optométrie Université de Montréal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The surveys utilized the SPEED questionnaire to determine perceived eye dryness (score greater than 10). The testing sites performed clinical tests of lower lid staining using fluorescein and a non-invasive tear break up time evaluation using each site’s Keratograph NIKBUT software. After clinical evaluation the clinicians accessed https://weather.com/forecast/allergy to record the daily pollen count for the area in which the patients stated they spent the most time in the last week prior to their clinical visit.\n\nResults:\nResults from 40 patients were recorded and analyzed. Using a Pearson linear correlation analysis, NIKBUT values were shown to be lower when pollen counts were higher (r=-0.34 p=0.031). Additionally average Lower lid staining scores were higher when pollen counts were higher (r=0.33. p=0.033). Pollen counts showed a directional trend of mild correlation with SPEED scores (r=0.26, p=0.092).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThere has long been suspicion that increased incidence of allergens may influence the clinical signs and symptoms of ocular surface disease that patient’s exhibit. In times of higher pollen counts, this study revealed statistically significant correlation with objective signs of increased lower lid staining and lower NIKBUT scores. Symptom scores also showed a mild correlation (directional trend) with increased pollen counts.

Second, the reflectance and transmittance of the screen layer under directional and diffuse illumination was measured. Third, the reflectance and transmittance spectra of thin glass normally used to protect mobile phones were measured using an UV–VIS absorption spectrometer (LAMBDA 3B with double beam from Perkin Elmer). Finally, with all the information gathered, a theoretical model was developed to calculate the increase in the flux of ultraviolet light reaching the eye.\n\nResults:\nThe light emitted by the smartphones resembles the spectrum of a white LED (no UV radiation). The screens of the three phones of the study have the same reflectance and transmittance properties. These screens reflect an 8% of the incoming light and transmit a 20% of the diffuse UV radiation (250-400nm). The protection thin-glass screens share the same properties. Very interestingly, screens of older phones reflected a 1% and transmitted a 0.1% (250-325nm). The theoretical model indicates that there is an increment on the amount of UV radiation that reaches the eye – caused by and proportional to the UV light reflected by the smartphone screen.\n\nConclusion(s):\nSmartphones do not produce UV radiation. However, the diffuse reflectance occurring on the screen when used outdoors duplicates the doses of UV radiation reaching the eye. Further improvements in the filtering capacities of smartphone screens when dealing with reflected UV light need to be developed (i.e. incorporating interference filters for UV light).","title":"Evaluation of the Increased Levels of UV Radiation Reaching the Eye Due to the Outdoor Use of Smartphones","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175327\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Joel Molina -Reyes, Pablo DeGracia, Jorge Martínez-Gaytan, Carlos Martínez-Gaytan, Rosalia Ramirez-Jaimes\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        INAOE, 4.

The goal of this study was to determine how dry eye is affected by temperature, humidity, breathing and heat indices by geographic location.\n\nMethods:\nSixteen investigator-designed questions related to allergy and dry eye including the ocular surface disease index (OSDI) and standard patient evaluation of eye dryness survey (SPEED) were administered to patients at four clinical sites in accordance with each site’s Institutional Review Board. Patients were provided a link (https://weather.com/forecast/allergy), to search allergy index, pollen counts, breathing and heat indices for their geographic location.\n\nResults:\n45 participants responded. The average age was 35.6 +14.8 (range 15 to 70) and 68.9% (31/45) were female. 53.3% (24/45) were considered dry by both SPEED and OSDI with average scores of 14.625 + 3.84 and 35.47+29.77. SPEED scores worsened as pollen (r=0.26, p < 0.001) and temperature (r=0.16, p<0.001) increased. SPEED scores improved as breathing indices (r=-0.32, p < 0.001) and humidity (r=-0.17, p= < 0.001) increased. As pollen (r=-0.15, p= < 0.001), breathing indices (r=-0.12, p= < 0.001), and humidity increased, OSDI scores showed a negative correlation (r=-0.19, p=0.047). Higher OSDI scores showed a positive correlation with increased temperature (r=0.22, p=0.0002). SPEED and OSDI symptom scores worsened and heat index increased (r=0.15, p < 0.001; r=0.22, p=0.0004).\n\nConclusion(s):\nDry eye can be a great burden to patients and a common trigger is the environment, specifically humidity. In climates with low humidity, dry eye signs and symptoms often worsen as tear evaporation increases. This study demonstrated that as humidity increased dry eye scores improved and as temperature and heat index increased, dry eye symptom scores worsened.","title":"Impact of Humidity Levels, Temperature, Breathing and Heat Indices on Dry Eye Symptom Scores","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175328\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Milton Hom, Leslie O'Dell, Clare Halleran\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Private Practice, Private Practice, Private Practice\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Roughly, 30 cases have been reported in medical literature.\n1\nIt is characterized by decreased lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, and therefore a reduced ability to esterify cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. The cholesterol accumulates in the body and deposits in a mosaic pattern along the central and peripheral corneal stroma, eventually leading to decreased visual acuity. Treatment is a penetrating keratoplasty, though few previous reports have demonstrated long-term graft survivability.\n\nCase Report:\nA 44-year-old white female presented with eye strain and reduced contrast sensitivity. She reported that her vision had been getting worse since adolescence and that she was now having difficulty completing activities of daily living. Her medical history was notable for osteopenia and partial LCAT deficiency. Her family history was notable for a brother with complete LCAT deficiency. She had a penetrating keratoplasty OD in 2015. Prior to surgery, slit lamp examination OD revealed moderate, diffuse opacification of central and peripheral corneal stroma. Pachymetry readings OD showed significant corneal thickening (1021 um). Two years status post-surgery, slit lamp examination OD remains unremarkable and pachymetry readings OD are stable (488 um). Patient is expected to undergo penetrating keratoplasty OS in the near future and will be fit in scleral contact lenses post surgery.\n\nConclusion:\nCentral and peripheral corneal stroma OD have remained clear of opacities for two years since receiving a penetrating keratoplasty. This establishes one of the longest postoperative observations for a patient with fish-eye disease. The patient will continue to be monitored closely as opacities may reoccur in the future.","title":"Long-Term Graft Survivability in Fish-Eye Disease (Partial LCAT Deficiency)","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175329\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        ColumbiaDoctors Ophthalmology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Leejee Suh, Nolan Wilson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        ColumbiaDoctors Ophthalmology, SUNY Optometry student\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

It usually presents unilaterally in middle aged white females1. EIA is driven by a dysfunction of the corneal endothelium which results in cellular migration to the anterior chamber angle and the iris2. This migration causes a disruption of aqueous outflow and can lead to glaucoma3. Additionally, it leads to corneal edema from a loss of the endothelial mosaic. The diagnosis of EIA is aided by case history, slit lamp examination, gonioscopy, and confocal microscopy4,5. Anterior segment OCT (ASOCT) may now be used to visualize of the endothelial disruption, iris atrophy and peripheral anterior synechiae7, and is a useful option to monitor the progression of the disease.\n\nCase Report:\nA 64 year old African American male presented to a Boston Veterans Affairs clinic as a new patient with “cloudiness” of vision from his left eye with a duration of 3-5 years. On examination, corneal edema and iris atrophy OS were evident. Peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) were found OS with gonioscopy. ASOCT confirmed and documented the extent of iris thinning and peripheral anterior synechiae OS. The right cornea and iris were essentially normal on clinical and ASOCT exam. The patient was prescribed therapeutic treatment of corneal edema and continues to do well without diagnosis of glaucoma.\n\nDiscussion:\nA patient of atypical age, gender, and race presented as a new patient with signs and symptoms consistent with essential iris atrophy. A thorough history, slit lamp examination, gonioscopy, and ASOCT were used to diagnose the condition. ASOCT was able to document the extent of the condition and is helpful in monitoring progression of the condition. Identification of EIA is important since these patients at are increased risk for glaucoma.","title":"Atypical Presentation of Essential Iris Atrophy with Anterior Segment OCT Findings","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175331\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This effort was to uncover any new risk factors from a patient profile survey and then refine the instrument items to predict dry eye.\n\nMethods:\n14 investigator-designed questions and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) were administered to clinic patients at seven clinical sites in accordance with each site's Institutional Review Board. Contact lens wearers were examined on a day they did not wear their lenses to minimize confounding of clinical findings related to contact lens removal at the time of examination. Subjects were defined as dry if their OSDI was ≥ 13 and had at least one clinical sign per established cut points: tear break up time, Efron corneal or conjunctival staining, meibomian gland expression quality, phenol red thread test. Proportions and chi-squared tests were performed on the categorical responses by subjects. Multivariate regression was then performed and a receiver operating characteristic curve generated.\n\nResults:\n115 subjects were included in this study (44.3% normal, 55.7% dry). Average age was 50.8 (15 to 83). The final regression model found four out of the 14 items statistically significant: migraines (p=0.001), seeing a doctor regularly (p=0.025), sinus issues (p=0.015), and use of eye drops (p=0.001). Age approached borderline significance (p=0.071). The dependent value of the multivariate regression was used to calculate the probability of dryness by applying the natural exponent. The cut point of 0.61 had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 74% with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.855.\n\nConclusion(s):\nNew risk factors were identified and previous known risk factors such as diabetes were not found to be significant. This refined five item instrument is brief and will be useful in population studies. Next steps entail validating its efficacy in an independent sample and seeing if it correlates to any clinical signs.","title":"Dry Eye Risk Assessment (DERA): New Predictive Risk Factors Identified","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175322\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern California College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jennifer Harthan, Katherine Mastrota, Andrew (Loc) Nguyen, Kristen Hipolito, Leslie O'Dell, Scott Schachter, Marc Bloomenstein, Scott Hauswirth, Milton Hom\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, New York Hotel Trade Council, California State University Fullerton, Private Practice Azusa CA, Mechanicsburg Eye Associates Wheatlyn EyeCare, Advanced Eyecare and The Eyewear Gallery Optometry, Schwartz Laser Eye Center, University of Colorado, Private Practice Azusa CA\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

OST was recorded using NEC infrared thermo-tracer TH 9260 and marking of the ocular surface and OST acquisition was performed using a novel ‘diamond’ demarcation method. Temperatures of the geometrical center cornea (GCC) and mean ocular surface temperature (MOST) of the region of interest were studied. Body temperature was measure using Braun thermometer and corneal curvature/eccentricity were measured using Medmont Corneal Topographer E300.\n\nResults:\nMean and SD of the GCC and MOST were 33.98°C ± 0.12 and 34.31°C ± 0.08 respectively for the studied population. GCC was shown to decrease significantly at a rate of 0.017°C / year (r = - 0.428, p < 0.001) and MOST was shown to decrease significantly at a rate of 0.019°C / year (r = - 0.500, p < 0.001) at 95% CI. Body temperature was shown to decrease significantly with increasing age by 0.004°C / year (r = - 0.233, p = 0.046). Corneal curvatures and eccentricity did not contribute to the change in OST with age.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOST decreases significantly with age throughout life in Asian eyes.

OCT images were acquired at the minimum TCT determined by Pentacam®. Images were processed with custom Matlab algorithms. ECT was measured at this location. Data was analysed using t-tests with MedCalc.\n\nResults:\nMean TCT was 429 ± 28 µm for the KCs wearing GPCL, and 494 ± 22 µm for the HCs wearing GPCL. For HCs wearing SCL, mean TCT was 488 ± 41 µm.

Zoledronate has been a popular treatment option due to its single annual infusion. Although it is an effective treatment, there have been emerging reports of periorbital and orbital inflammation associated with its use.\n\nCase Report:\n65 y/o male presented with 2 day history of red OD, tender/swollen RUL/RLL following Reclast infusion for osteoporosis 6 days prior; he reported having flu-like symptoms during the two days preceding the onset of the red eye. BCVA was 20/20 OD, 20/20 OS. There was no APD, CVF were FTFC OD/OS, EOM was full OU with pain on eye movement OD. Slit lamp exam revealed focal erythema RLL, 1-2+ diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, and 1+ conjunctival chemosis OD. IOP and DFE were unremarkable OU. At the 2-day follow-up, 4 mm proptosis was observed and he had new complaint of retrobulbar pain. CT and MRI of the orbit revealed right periorbital inflammation with postseptal extension. Empiric IV antibiotics were initiated with mild improvement in symptoms. Although periorbital inflammation persisted at 1-week follow-up, the signs and symptoms later self-resolved.\n\nDiscussion:\nFew cases of bisphosphonate-induced orbital inflammation have been reported. Patients usually experience a prodromal illness followed by ophthalmic involvement that responds rapidly to corticosteroid therapy. Orbital CT or MRI often reveals extensive preseptal and postseptal inflammation without a particular disease focus. It is important to recognize these potential adverse effects to treat accordingly.\n\nConclusion(s):\nAlthough uncommon, zoledronate injections should be considered as a differential diagnosis for periorbital and orbital inflammation.","title":"Presumed Reclast-associated Orbital Inflammation","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175315\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Danielle Weiler, Matthew Rhodes\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern Arizona VA Health Care System, Southern Arizona VA Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This case report details an occurrence of scleritis in a patient who is unable to take oral NSAIDs and the role of anterior segment OCT in his diagnosis.\n\nCase Report:\nA 62-year-old male presented with symptoms of intense ocular pain, profuse tearing, blur, and light sensitivity, worsening over the course of 6 days OS. The patient’s systemic history included diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and hepatocellular carcinoma treated with liver transplantation. His medication list was extensive and included Tacrolimus to prevent transplant rejection. Examination was significant for severe lid tenderness with mild edema, moderate to severe bulbar injection, moderate chemosis, and 2+ cells and flare in the anterior chamber OS. He was diagnosed with acute unilateral non-granulomatous anterior uveitis and treated with topical steroids and Atropine. On day 5 of treatment, patient reported improvement in symptoms, but still had moderate pain and tenderness. On examination, the anterior chamber reaction had completely resolved while the bulbar injection remained unchanged despite aggressive topical steroid treatment. Anterior segment OCT revealed increased scleral thickness and presence of hyporeflective areas of edema consistent with scleritis. Therefore, his diagnosis was modified to mild, diffuse, sectoral, anterior scleritis. Treatment modification was challenging due to increased risk for nephrotoxicity when taking Tacrolimus and oral NSAIDs. After consulting with ophthalmology, the treatment plan included both topical steroids and topical NSAIDs. The topical treatment was effective and patient recovered after 3 weeks.\n\nConclusion(s):\nScleritis comes with a variety of symptoms that may occur with other inflammatory disorders such as uveitis. Utilization of anterior segment OCT and close follow up can allow for appropriate treatment and management.","title":"A Case of Anterior Scleritis in a Liver Transplant Recipient","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175316\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        City of Vision Eye Care\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Grace Tsan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Veterans Administration\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

We describe a case of luxation of the lens in a patient with a history of corneal transplantation and congenital cataract.\n\nCase Report:\nA 30-year-old white male presented with a complaint of darkening vision OS of sudden onset two hours prior to examination. Upon self-inspection moments after the episode, the patient noted a large white object in his left eye. He reported no history of trauma or systemic conditions. The patient’s ocular history was significant for a corneal transplant and strabismus surgery OS prior to the age of five and no central vision OS since childhood. Vision OS was CF@5’, with 11 o’clock eccentric fixation. IOP was measured to be 48 mmHg OS. Slit lamp evaluation showed 1+ edema within the corneal graft, 1+ cell and flare in the anterior chamber and a 5mm round, opaque, white lesion located anterior to the iris inferiorly. Acute angle closure protocol was instigated and IOP was lowered to 34mm Hg. The patient was told to return to clinic the following morning. At 8:50 am the next day, IOP was lowered to 14 mm and a diagnosis of anterior luxated congenital cataract was made. The patient was referred to OMD for surgical removal of the lens. The patient was prescribed pred acetate 1%, Muro 128 ung, and scheduled for surgical removal of the lens along with a limited anterior vitrectomy in 48 hours.\n\nConclusion(s):\nSudden, non-traumatic luxation of the lens is exceedingly rare and is often associated with systemic hereditary conditions. This event can lead to acute angle closure and damage to the corneal endothelium. Urgent management of angle closure and subsequent referral for surgical removal of lens material led to resolution of angle closure and no LPI was needed. The patient will be monitored closely for failure of the corneal graft in the future.","title":"Spontaneous Non-Traumatic Unilateral Luxation of the Crystalline Lens in a Caucasian Male with a History of Congenital Cataract","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175318\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Vladimir Yevseyenkov\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This prospective study enrolled consecutive patients being evaluated for new ScCL fitting between 6/2016-8/2016 at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary. Fitting indication, prior interventions, OSDI, VFQ-25 and baseline exam were recorded and repeated at 6 weeks.\n\nCase Report:\nNineteen patients were enrolled with a mean age of 54 (range 24-90) with 58% female. Primary treatment indication was ocular surface disease(OSD) in 74% (8 female, 6 male) and corneal irregularity(CI) in 26% (3 female, 2 male). The majority were evaluated for ScCL in both eyes (68%).\n\nPrevious treatments for OSD included topical lubricants (100%), oral antibiotics (71%), bandage lenses (71%), punctal occlusion (67%), cyclosporine A (57%), topical steroids (36%) and serum tears (29%), with a mean of 5 treatments prior to ScCL evaluation. Therapeutic goals in OSD eyes were ocular surface support (93%) and improved comfort (93%). OSDI improved from 27 to 16 after ScCL use in patients with OSD (n=5).\n\nIndications for ScCL evaluation in CI eyes included poor best correct visual acuity, foreign body sensation, eye pain, RGP intolerance and RGP fit failure. Previous treatments included RGPs (100%), soft (40%), hybrid (20%), and piggyback lenses (20%) with a mean of 1.8 treatments prior to evaluation. Vision improved for 7 eyes of patients with CI from 0.80 logMAR to 0.10 logMAR during the screening visit.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe majority of patients in this series presented for lens evaluation due to OSD and had attempted multiple other treatments prior to evaluation. Additional prospective studies are needed to further define the long-term benefits of scleral lenses.","title":"Indications for Scleral Lens Use and Previous Treatment in a Tertiary Referral Clinic","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175319\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary at UIC\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ellen Shorter, Sneha Bontu, Charlotte Joslin, Timothy McMahon, Mark Rosenblatt\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

AF is indicated for keratoconjunctivtis sicca to promote healing of the ocular surface.\n\nCase Report:\nA 48-year-old healthy Asian female complained of long-standing contact lens (CL) intolerance with noticeable deposits after 5 hours of wear. Her ocular history is significant for use of rigid gas permeable (Boston ES) CLs for 30 years, and use of numerous non-preserved artificial tears and omega-3 fish oils without improvement in symptoms. Examination showed no signs of aqueous or lipid deficiency, but severe symptoms accompanied by tear film instability and patchy corneal and conjunctival staining suggested presence of mucin deficiency. Tear-aqueous quantity was normal by tear meniscus (0.26,0.28 mm OD,OS) and Schirmer’s I (12,14 mm OD,OS). Tear-lipid thickness (TLT), meibomian gland expression, and meibography were normal. However, coalesced corneal staining (fluorescein) and conjunctival staining (lissamine green) were accompanied by short tear breakup times (TBUTs): 1.74 sec OD, 2.89 sec OS with fluorescein and 5.23 sec OD, 3.94 sec OS with Medmont. Regener-Eyes® AF ophthalmic solution was recommended twice daily to facilitate ocular surface healing. Corneal staining resolved after 19 days. The severity of conjunctival staining, although markedly improved after 19 days, had subsided to mild after 49 days. TLT increased 20 days after treatment while TBUT remained unchanged. Patient reported mild improvement in dryness symptoms but continued to notice lens deposits impeding vision after 5 hours of lens wear.\n\nConclusion(s):\nRegener-Eyes® appears to be effective at healing the ocular surface after approximately 3 weeks of treatment. Our goal is to follow this patient over the next 6 months and consider alternative treatments targeting mucin production to improve tear film stability.","title":"Ocular Surface Healing with Amniotic Fluid Ophthalmic Solution in a Patient with Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175320\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UC Berkeley School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Thao Yeh, Meng Lin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UC Berkeley School of Optometry Clinical Research Center, UC Berkeley School of Optometry Clinical Research Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study is to compare pre-surgical measurements of corneal thickness to intra-operative measurements.\n\nMethods:\n19 eyes with keratoconus from 19 subjects were imaged with a research grade swept-source optical coherence tomographer (SS-OCT) no more than one month prior to receiving CXL surgery. 11 received CXL surgery and 8 eyes received CXL with intracorneal ring segments (CXL+ICRS). The pre-operative thicknesses of the cornea and the epithelial layer at the point of minimum total corneal thickness were acquired from the SS-OCT images using custom processing software. The epithelial thickness measurement was subtracted from the total corneal thickness measurement to obtain the epithelium-off value. The minimum corneal thickness during CXL surgery was measured using ultrasound pachymetry, after the epithelial layer was removed.\n\nResults:\nFor the CXL only group, the mean epithelium-off pre-operative thickness measured with the OCT was 409.5 ± 29.7 µm and was not significantly different than the mean intra-operative measurement of 426.5 ± 29.8 µm (p=0.09). For the CXL + ICRS group, the mean pre-operative value of 400.6 ± 37.7 µm was significantly smaller than the mean intra-operative measurement of 438.8 ± 32.1 µm (p=0.01). Both comparisons showed weak correlations of R2 = 0.22 for the CXL only group and R2 = 0.36 for the CXL + ICRS group.\n\nConclusion(s):\nSince pre-operative and intraoperative corneal thickness is used to determine treatment options in CXL, this discrepancy in corneal thickness measurements after CXL + ICRS requires further investigation to ensure safe application of ultraviolet light. The use of hypotonic drops in those three cases may have affected the results.","title":"Central Corneal Thickness Comparison Between Pre-Operative and Intra-Operative Measurements for Corneal Crosslinking Surgery","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175321\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Olivera Kralj, Sebastian Marschall, Ahmed Gawish, Paul Fieguth, Neera Singal, Hall Chew, David Rootman, Allan Slomovic, Wendy Hatch, Kostadinka Bizheva, Kostadinka Sorbara\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo, Oculus, University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Maria Navascues-Cornago","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/the-influence-of-methodology-on-blink-dynamics","text":"Abstract\n\nPurpose:\nDue to the rapid movement of the eyelids during blinking, special techniques are required to observe human blinking. High-speed cameras typically require the use of bright illumination. This pilot study compares spontaneous blinking characteristics captured under white light and infrared illumination.\n\nMethods:\nSpontaneous eyelid blinking was characterized in eight subjects. The blinking motion was recorded at 500 frames per second under two illumination conditions: white light and infrared. Custom video analysis was used to determine palpebral aperture height (PAH), blink rate, blink speed and blink duration. Subjective comfort was also captured (0-100 scale).\n\nResults:\nThese data showed a difference in PAH between white light and infrared illumination (9.4 ± 0.8 vs. 10.4 ± 1.3mm, p < 0.001). Blink rate was higher for white light compared with infrared illumination (22.4 ± 9.3 vs. 17.5 ± 8.4blink/min, p = 0.03). The blink speed during the closing and opening phases was higher for white light compared with infrared illumination (closing phase: 196.4 ± 57.8 vs. 182.4 ± 51.6mm/s, p = 0.04; opening phase: 69.8 ± 24.5 vs. 60.8 ± 16.2mm/s, p = 0.0007). The total blink duration was longer for infrared illumination compared with white light (212 ± 74 vs. 193 ± 64ms, p = 0.002). Subjects felt more comfortable performing the task under infrared illumination than white light (74.2 ± 6.7 vs. 41.7 ± 8.2, p = 0.002).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis pilot study has shown that human spontaneous blinking can be recorded and characterized using either infrared illumination or white light. However, the use of high intensity white light required for imaging appears to influence the characteristics of spontaneous blinking. Infrared illumination represents a less invasive technique that is also better tolerated by subjects.","title":"The Influence of Methodology on Blink Dynamics","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175311\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Eurolens Research, The University of Manchester\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Michael Read, Carole Maldonado-Codina, Philip Morgan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Eurolens Research The University of Manchester, Eurolens Research The University of Manchester, Eurolens Research The University of Manchester\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Alexandra Horne","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/transparent-medical-dressing-moisture-chamber-for-the-treatment-of-exposure-keratopathy","text":"Abstract\n\nIntroduction\n\nTransparent medical dressings, like Tegaderm, have many applications in healthcare. They provide a barrier to external contaminants, while allowing for exchange of vapor and gas. They are hypoallergenic and latex-free. In the ophthalmic setting, they can be used to create a moisture chamber for the treatment of various corneal diseases including lagophthalmos-related exposure keratopathy.\n\nCase Report:\nAn 85 yo Caucasian male presented with recent diagnosis of a left Bell’s palsy and severe ocular pain. Vision OS was 20/30-. External observation revealed left facial laxity, complete loss of reflexive and voluntary blinking, and absence of a Bell’s reflex with attempted forced lid closure. Anterior segment findings included 3+ SPK and a small corneal abrasion. The patient was diagnosed with severe exposure keratopathy secondary to facial nerve dysfunction.\n\nDiscussion:\nInitial treatment with pressure patching and aggressive lubrication provided mild improvement of corneal signs, but extensive SPK remained and the patient continued to report extreme ocular pain. To promote healing and comfort, a moisture chamber was created using Lacrilube PM and Tegaderm.  The ocular surface was covered with Lacrilube, and a Tegaderm dressing cut to size was tented over the orbit from the nasal bone to the lateral orbital rim and from the frontal bone to the maxilla bone. The dressing was replaced every 24 hours with re-application of the ointment. After one week of continued use, a significant improvement of corneal signs was observed and the patient denied ocular pain.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe use of transparent medical dressings in conjunction with lubricating ointment to create a moisture chamber may be considered in cases of severe exposure keratopathy as an alternative to surgical intervention. This treatment method provides a temporary lubricating environment to foster corneal healing while also facilitating clinical observation.","title":"Transparent Medical Dressing Moisture Chamber for the Treatment of Exposure Keratopathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175312\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        James Smith, Laura Dowd\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA Maine Healthcare, VA Maine Healthcare\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

It was our purpose to examine these parameters to determine if habitual swimming goggle wear contributes to meibomian gland atrophy and ultimately dry eye.\n\nMethods:\nSubjects with minimal goggle wear experience (normals) and subjects with maximal goggle wear experience (competitive swimmers) were recruited. An unmasked examiner collected dry eye clinical data and captured meibography images. A second masked investigator assessed meiboscore and gland morphology. Clinical tests included symptom questionnaires (OSDI and Schein), lipid layer thickness via interferometry, tear breakup time, corneal and conjunctival staining, lid margin signs, gland secretion quality (Bron scale), and Schirmer I.\n\nResults:\n39 age-matched subjects completed the study (25 normals, 14 goggle-wearing swimmers). Differences in meiboscore, percent gland area remaining, average lipid layer thickness, corneal and conjunctival staining, gland expression (Bron), and Schirmer 1 test were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Schein and OSDI had more drier scores than normal, but did not reach significance. TBUT was significantly shorter in goggle wearers (p = 0.0363, Mann-Whitney).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThere was no apparent difference in meibomian gland morphology between goggle-wearing swimmers and non-goggle wearers in this study sample. TBUT was significantly shorter in the swimming group; however, the small sample size may be a limiting factor in observing differences.

He reported a foreign body struck his OS 4 days prior while cutting brush in the woods. Ocular history was positive for cataracts, and medical history was non-contributory. Vision measured 20/20 OD and OS. Extraocular motilities, confrontations, and pupils were normal OU. Pain was noted on the nasolacrimal sac left lower lid. Slit lamp found grade 2+ injection of inferonasal conjunctiva OS. Corneae and anterior chambers were clear OU. No foreign body was found. Tonometry measured 14 OD and 18 OS. Dilated fundus exam was unremarkable OU. The patient was diagnosed with Dacryocystitis OS and treated with oral cephalexin and Polytrim ophthalmic solution. At 3 day urgent follow up exam, the patient reported marked pain now on temporal lower lid OS. A scabbed lesion was noted in this region. Beneath the scab a larva was found burrowing into the eye lid toward the globe. With great difficulty, the larva was removed using a jeweler forceps and forceful digital pressure. The remainder of the anterior and posterior segment exam was stable.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe patient was diagnosed with cutaneous myiasis left lower lid. He was instructed to finish the oral cephalexin 14 day course. Mayo clinic confirmed that the specimen was a “fly larva”. Myiasis is the infection of a fly larva in human tissue. Typically the parasite is the larva of the human bot fly [Dermatobia hominis], and the infection occurs in tropical areas of Africa or South America. It is rarely acquired in the United States. This patient had not traveled outside New England for years. He is a hunter/trapper, so he most likely was infested with a rabbit or rodent botfly.","title":"Oculo-cutaneous Myiasis:  Infection of Fly Larva in Human Tissue","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175314\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dept of Veterans Affairs\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jonathan Andrews\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        OPTOMETRIC ASSOCIATES\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The electronic survey invitation was distributed by the National Keratoconus Foundation and public links were shared among keratoconus support groups.\n\nResults:\n423 individuals with keratoconus completed the survey. The majority of respondents (74%) were from the US. The average age of respondents was 47 years (SD +/- 15 years) with 62% female. Ninety percent of individuals reported bilateral disease, 6% were diagnosed in the right eye only and 4% in the left eye only. The most common age at diagnosis was between 11-20 years (37%) with the second most common age range from 21-30 years (35%). An ophthalmologist was the primary provider for 51% of respondents, an optometrist for 41%, and a technician/non-doctor for 8%. There was a range of optical corrections for one or both eyes including corneal gas permeable lenses (25%), scleral lenses (22%), spectacles (21%), no correction (11%), hybrid lenses (8%), soft contact lenses (7%) and other types of correction (3%). Eighteen percent reported surgical intervention for one or both eyes: full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty (9%), corneal cross-linking (6%) intrastromal ring segments (6%) and lamellar keratoplasty (4%).\n\nConclusion(s):\nWhile corneal gas permeable lenses have traditionally been the gold standard optical correction for keratoconus, scleral lenses are being used almost as frequently in this group. Surgical interventions are uncommon despite half of respondents obtaining care from an ophthalmologist.","title":"Patient-Reported Experience with Keratoconus","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175304\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Cherie Nau, Jennifer Harthan, Amy Nau, Jenny Fogt, Joe Barr, Muriel Schornack\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Mayo Clinic, Illinois College of Optometry, Korb and Associates, Ohio State University, Ohio State University, The Mayo Clinic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

It involves alteration of corneal shape and thickness. Corneal biomechanics could be affected due to corneal geometry changes. Few studies using bidirectional non-contact applanation tonometry investigated effect of orthokeratology on corneal biomechanics. This study measured corneal tangent modulus from short-term orthokeratology.\n\nMethods:\nSixteen young non-contact lens wearers were recruited. Their refractive errors were between -4D to -5D sphere, and astigmatism within -1.50D, in each eye. One eye, randomly selected, wore orthokeratology lens and the fellow eye wore conventional rigid gas permeable (RGP) lens. Wearing time included 30 minutes, 60 minutes and one night, in separate visits randomly assigned with a washout time of at least one week between visits. Corneal radius, thickness and corneal biomechanics (using bidirectional non-contact applanation tonometry and an indentation device) were measured before and after lens wear, and compared between the two eyes.\n\nResults:\nAll corneal parameters were similar before lens wear at each visit, confirming sufficient washout time. Significant corneal flattening was observed, even with 30-minute of orthokeratology lens wear, accompanied by myopia reduction (0.63D), and the amount increased with duration of lens wear. After one night of orthokeratology lens wear, myopia was reduced by 1.18D. No significant change was observed in the fellow eye. Corneal resistance factor was reduced (0.4mmHg) after 30-min of orthokeratology lens wear. A significant reduction of corneal hysteresis (0.4mmHg) was also found when wearing RGP lens for one night. Corneal stiffness and tangent modulus measured by the indentation device were stable in both eyes throughout the study.\n\nConclusion(s):\nCorneal stiffness and tangent modulus were stable biomechanical parameters. They did not vary from short-term orthokeratology. Changes in corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor could be related to their intrinsic measurement variability.","title":"Effect of Orthokeratology on Corneal Tangent Modulus: A Short-Term Randomized Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175306\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Hong Kong Polytechnic University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Stanley Leung, Ying Hon, Shu-ho Lu, Kit-ying Wong, Pui-kwan Tiu, David Lam\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Ocular history included trichiasis with entropion OS due to trauma. Also, two instances of Herpes Simplex Keratitis OS which induced macular edema for which the patient was being treated with Ketorolac QID. Systemic medical history included Diabetes, controlled with Metformin. BCVAs OD: 20/40 PH 20/25; OS: 20/200 PH 20/125. Biomicroscopy revealed circular anterior scarring centrally, all other findings unremarkable OD. Anterior stromal scar with adherent iris, diffuse neovascularization, symblepharon, 2mmX2mm superior nasal ulceration with thinning, no signs of perforation and decreased corneal sensitivity OS. Dilated fundus examination showed no remarkable findings OD, and cystic macular edema OS. The two leading diagnosis were Corneal Melt induced by Ketorolac and Neurotrophic Keratitis. Neurotropic Keratitis was ruled out because patient regained corneal sensitivity after discontinuing Ketorolac. Patient was followed daily for a week and then weekly while being treated with Moxeza QID, Artificial Tears Q2Hrs, and bandage contact lenses OS. Patient was also monitored with a Visante OCT to measure corneal thickness. At the final visit, BCVAs improved to PH 20/80, corneal melt was resolved, and cystic macular edema remained.

Although tetracyclines are known to cause various hyperpigmentation throughout different areas of the body, mainly the skin, nails, teeth, and oral mucosa, ocular hyperpigmentation is not as common and may be easily overlooked. This case illustrates the differential diagnoses and proper management for pigment deposits in the conjunctiva.\n\nCase Report:\nA 28 year old Caucasian male presents for a comprehensive eye exam with no complaints. Ocular history is unremarkable. Systemic history is remarkable for depression and anxiety, asthma, and cystic acne. Medications include Celexa, Clonazepam, and Minocycline use for greater than 10 years. Acuities are 20/20 OD and OS and all preliminary tests are unremarkable. Slit lamp examination is unremarkable except for small cystic pouches enveloping pigmented deposits in the inferior palpebral conjunctiva of the right eye. Baseline photos were taken and recommended biopsy with oculoplastic surgeon. Patient returned for follow up in 4 months and all findings were stable with no development of any other deposits. Patient was diagnosed with minocycline induced conjunctival hyperpigmentation and correspondence was sent to the patient’s dermatologist.\n\nConclusion(s):\nDiscoloration of facial features, namely the eye, may be an undesirable cosmetic side effect of tetracycline use, which can be permanent despite discontinuation of therapy. Educating patients and dermatologists about this effect when on these medications may avoid these adverse effects before long term use is initiated. In addition, there are various differentials for hyperpigmentation or pigment deposits in the conjunctiva. Although most arise from benign conditions, a melanoma is a differential that may be fatal. It is pertinent to differentiate these types of lesions and properly diagnose the etiology in order to prevent missing fatal disease.","title":"Minocycline-Induced Palpebral Conjunctiva Hyperpigmentation","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175308\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

While the adjunctive therapies lower the rate of pterygium recurrence, they can cause scleral necrosis requiring immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nCase Report:\nA 33-year-old Hispanic male presented to the clinic with a complaint of bilateral conjunctival growths which were cosmetically unappealing. His vision at was 20/20 OD/OS with biomicroscopy revealing bi-nasal pterygia. Ocular health was otherwise normal, so the patient was referred for pterygium excision. The surgeon removed the pterygia using a bare sclera technique with mitomycin C to prevent regrowth. Nine weeks later, the patient presented with a complaint of severe ocular pain and redness in the left eye. Unaided vision was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS. IOPs were 14mmHg OD and OS. Biomicroscopy revealed an area of blanched sclera at the surgical site with surrounding hyperemia and a moderate chamber reaction in the left eye. Initial treatment of tobramycin/dexamethasone ointment QID OS only showed little improvement after a week. He was then switched to indomethacin 50 mg PO BID and prednisolone acetate 1% ophthalmic solution 6 times a day OS. The patient was followed weekly for two months and was slowly tapered off all medications, leading to resolution of the scleritis and returning unaided vision to 20/20 OD and OS with only minimal scleral thinning. Subsequent blood work was negative for autoimmune disorders.\n\nConclusion(s):\nMitomycin C (MMC) reduces pterygium recurrence by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation in the episclera but carries the risk of tissue necrosis. SINS caused by MMC can be managed by immunosuppressive therapy to eliminate inflammation, eventually halting necrosis. It is still important to rule out infection and to order blood work for appropriate treatment.","title":"Necrotizing Scleritis Following Uncomplicated Pterygium Surgery Using Mitomycin C","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175309\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Marcus Gonzales, David Dinh, Andrew Kemp, Joe Deloach, Zanna Kruoch\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Clinical characteristics include a crescent-shaped infiltrative lesion that can spread in a circumferential manner along the periphery of the cornea with corneal thinning. Conventional treatment includes immunosuppressive agents including topical steroids.\n\nCase report:\nA 54-year-old Hispanic female presented with a chief complaint of “white dots that had been visible on her left eye for one week. She reported associated symptoms of blurry vision, discomfort, foreign body sensation, and photophobia. Her medical history includes uncontrolled rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nBest corrected visual acuities were OD 20/20 and OS 20/20. Biomicroscopy revealed an area of excavation of the inferior cornea, measured to be about 1.5 mm x 2 mm with a 30% loss of corneal thickness. The patient was diagnosed with PUK of the left eye secondary to uncontrolled rheumatoid arthritis.& She was started on an initial regimen of doxycycline 50 mg bid po and prednisolone acetate 1% QID OS. Despite improvement with topical steroid therapy, a concern for corneal thinning prompted the use of a hydrated amniotic membrane. The membrane was applied to the left eye with a taper schedule for the steroid and continuation of doxycycline. Upon removal of the amniotic membrane a week later, complete re-epithelialization of the lesion was noted. The lesion resulted in a dense corneal scar with approximately 20% thinning. The addition of the amniotic membrane greatly aided the cornea's ability to heal without the risk of progressive corneal thinning.\n\nDiscussion:\nPeripheral ulcerative keratitis can result in perforation of the cornea if not managed appropriately. The novel use of an amniotic membrane may aid in a greater chance for successful management of this condition without adding further risks of corneal thinning.","title":"The Application of an Amniotic Membrane in a Case of Peripheral Ulcerative Keratitis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175310\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Waziha Samin, Andrew Kemp, Joe Deloach, Marcus Gonzales\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The RAPID study group is a multi-centered clinical trial enrolling patients with suspected Ad-Cs to test the safety and efficacy of one-time, in-office 5% ophthalmic Betadine treatment. Here, we report the clinical signs and symptoms found in red-eye presenting individuals during their initial screening visit, and compare the results for those with and without molecularly-confirmed Ad-Cs.\n\nMethods:\nEligibility included informed consent, age 18 or older, and a red eye with symptoms ≤4 days. Subjects rated the severity of ten ocular symptoms on a scale of 0 (not bothersome) to 10 (very bothersome). Clinicians rated eight clinical signs of the first affected eye on a scale of 1 (absent), to 5 (severe). Conjunctival swabs were performed, and the presence of adenovirus in these samples was assessed using qPCR assays.\n\nResults:\nConjunctival swabs were obtained from 115 subjects on their screening visit, of which 16.5% (n=19) tested qPCR positive for Ad-Cs. For symptoms, there was a statistically significant difference between qPCR positive and negative subjects for 6 of the 10 queried symptoms: itching (p=0.01), eyelid swelling (p=0.01), redness (p=0.02), light sensitivity (p=0.02), gritty sensation (p= 0.01), and overall discomfort (p=0.01). There was a statistically significant difference between qPCR positive and negative subjects in 4 of the 8 clinical signs: lid edema (p=0.006), clear serous discharge (p=0.02), bulbar redness (p=0.002), and conjunctival follicular response (p=0.02).

Only the right eye underwent surgery and treatment with the left eye serving as an untreated control. Rabbits were evaluated by slit lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, anterior Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), and histopathology. Eyes were scored based on a modified McDonald-Shadduck scoring system and imaged following fluorescein staining. OCT imaging and digital slit lamp photography was performed at day -7 (baseline), 0, 7, 21 and 28. The right eyes were formalin-fixed, processed routinely for light microscopy and H&E staining. The corneal lesions were evaluated and scored for inflammatory infiltrate in the cornea and anterior chamber, stromal edema and vascularization and epithelial integrity.\n\nResults:\nCorneal opacification and stromal haze were observed at the surgical margin of the flap, while the central flap area maintained normal transparency at the end of the study. No significant differences between groups were observed by clinical and histopathological evaluations at any time point except on Day 28 in which Group 3 had significantly less haze than Group 1 (mean score of 0.8 vs. 1.3, P = 0.0387). Histologically, discrete regions of epithelial thickening were observed at the surgical margin of the stromal flaps in all groups.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis animal study supports that OM3 eye drops is suitable for post-LASIK usage. These results support further work to study the use of OM3 in human post-operative care.","title":"Effects of the Topical Application of Refresh Optive® Mega-3 After Lasik Surgery in Rabbits","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175295\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Haixia Liu, Andrea Rodrigues, Soohyun Kim, Jennifer Li, Monica Motta, Leandro Teixeira, Christopher Murphy, Joseph Vehige, Peter Simmons\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Clinical Development Allergan Plc.

The OCT source is a broadband 840nm superluminescent diode with 175nm bandwidth, and has an axial resolution of 1.5um in corneal tissue. The TDF source is a white incandescent bulb. Both the OCT and the TDF simultaneously scanned a 3mm diameter area of the central cornea. The PCTF thickness was quantified by measuring the peaks in reflectivity profiles that represented the air-tear and tear-cornea interface, and LL thickness was quantified by assigning thickness values to the hue-saturation-values (HSV) of the lipid pattern. To measure PCTF and LL thinning rates, the OCT scanned 3 transversal sections (superior, central, and inferior) within the 3mm zone of the central PCTF over a course of 20s. Simultaneously, the TDF measured the average LL thickness of the entire 3mm zone over a course of 20s. To demonstrate the technique for the first time in humans, a volunteer was asked to blink 3 times before keeping their eyelids open for 20s. Measurement of thinning rates started at 2.5s after the final blink.\n\nResults:\nThe initial PCTF thicknesses were 4.6um, 4.6um, and 4.2um, and the PCTF thinning rates ([95%CI], R2) were 3.4um/min ([3.3, 3.4], R2=0.998), 3.0um/min ([2.9, 3.1], R2=0.993), and 4.2um/min ([4.1, 4.2], R2=0.998) for the superior, central, and inferior PCTF sections, respectively. The initial LL thickness was 91nm and decreased at a rate of 1.9nm/min ([1.3, 2.5], R2=0.550).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe OCT and the TDF can simultaneously measure both PCTF and LL thinning over larger areas than previously described optical systems are capable, and with distinct spatial measurement capabilities.","title":"The Development of an Optical Coherence Tomography and an Interferometer Combined System to Measure Tear Film and Lipid Layer Thinning Rate","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175297\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Yuqiang Bai, Jason Nichols\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The classic location for lymphoma is in the inferior fornix, though may be noted elsewhere. Lymphoma is most common in females in the 5th to 7th decades. After squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, it is the third most common malignancy involving the conjunctiva.\n\nCase Report:\nA 62 year old African American male presented for a routine eye exam. Visual acuity was best-corrected to 20/20-3 OD, 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive to light with no APD OU. Extraocular motility was full OU and confrontation fields full to finger count OU. Anterior segment revealed mild ptosis OD. Lid eversion showed with a 10 x 22 mm flesh-colored lesion along the temporal bulbar conjunctiva with large lobulated lesions along the superior palpebral conjunctiva. All other anterior and posterior segment findings were unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with conjunctiva neoplasm of uncertain behavior and referred to oculoplastics, and for oncology work-up.

Significant improvements in wrinkle self-assessment reduction (p < 0.001), OSDI (p < 0.001) and SPEED (p < 0.001) were seen. Average change in OSDI was 49 to 32.8. Average change in SPEED was 16.7 to 10.7.  Some dry eye signs also showed modest improvements: 50% had an improvement in Lipid Layer Thickness (p=0.03  OU).  Non-significant improvements were seen in D.E.T. TFBUT and NaFl staining.  No changes were noted for lissome green straining, tear meniscus height, meibography or meibum secretion.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis pilot study demonstrated improvements in dry eye symptoms and wrinkle reduction using the ThermiSmooth® device. This effect lasted for weeks after treatment. Further studies are needed to verify treatment effects. The mechanism of action is not well established and may be linked to neuro-stimulation of the nerves supporting the meibomian glands.","title":"A Pilot Evaluation of a Radio Frequency Thermistor for Use in Dry Eye Treatment","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175301\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Whitney Hauser\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The effects of PV to the conjunctiva and eyelids can be devastating if left untreated. Typically presenting in older adults, these patients may also have additional, more common ocular comorbidities such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n\n\nCase Report\n: An 83-year-old Caucasian male with pemphigus vulgaris underwent conversion from dry to wet AMD OD.  Although the patient was being treated for his PV, the condition continued to worsen as he refused more aggressive treatment options. Due to the severity of his pemphigus vulgaris, he was unable to undergo anti-VEGF therapy for his wet AMD given the increased risk of endophthalmitis. Unfortunately, vision in his right eye was compromised and he continued to be monitored closely for development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) OS.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe presence of ulcerated lid margins and severe blepharitis precluded the retina specialist from performing an anti-VEGF injection even though it meant potentially missing the opportunity to recover functional vision in the right eye. Endophthalmitis secondary to anti-VEGF injection occurs with an incidence between 0.7% to 1.6%.External infectious processes such as blepharitis, and eyelid abnormalities such as ectropion, have been found to increase this risk and are established contraindications to anti-VEGF treatment.\n\nConclusion:\nFor this 83-year-old patient with dementia and limited mobility, keeping medical intervention to a minimum was his priority. This case exemplifies the importance of aggressive treatment early on, before a severity and patient age is reached that makes clinical improvement difficult. Furthermore, it is important to consider anterior segment disease, like pemphigus vulgaris, in the treatment of posterior segment disease due to the increased risk of complications such as endophthalmitis.","title":"Where Anterior & Posterior Segment Meet: Pemphigus Vulgaris Complications Prevent Anti-VEGF for Wet AMD","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175302\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Missouri-St. Louis College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sherrol Reynolds\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

In this study, the accuracy of central corneal thickness measurements of the new Optovue Avanti instrument were compared to measurements with ultrasound pachymetry.\n\nMethods:\nThe central corneal thickness was measured in 33 subjects over 18 years of age. The CCT was measured by USP with the Pachmate DGH-55 as well as the newer, less invasive Optovue Avanti widefield OCT instrument. Avanti measurements were taken three times followed by the Pachmate. Data was assessed using a Bland-Altman analysis.\n\nResults:\nThe mean (±1 SD) CCT measured by USP, Avanti minimum (min), and Avanti central 2 mm (C2) were 559.3 ± 30.1µm, 539.4 ± 28.8µm, and 546.4 ± 28.9µm. Bland-Altman analysis of USP and Avanti min showed an upper 95% LOA of 32.10µm and a lower 95% LOA of 8.63µm. The same analysis of USP and Avanti C2 showed an upper 95% limit of agreement (LOA) of 22.75µm and a lower 95% LOA of 2.22µm. The intra-class correlation was 0.992 for the Avanti min and central 2mm.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe Optovue Avanti, as well as several other OCT instruments evaluated through previous studies demonstrated remarkable accuracy compared to USP and repeatability with corneal pachymetry measurements. The results from the two measurement techniques correlate well with each other and the non-contact aspect of OCT pachymetry makes it an excellent alternative to conventional techniques in monitoring corneal thickness values.","title":"Accuracy and Repeatability of CCT Measurements with Optovue Avanti and USP","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175303\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Randy Cox, Earlena McKee\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Northeastern State University, Northeastern State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Clinicians are often frustrated when there is disagreement between clinical signs. Since most of dry eye has meibomian gland involvement, the focus of this study was to determine if the presence of an altered meibum secretion would agree or disagree with other signs.\n\nMethods:\nSubjects were recruited across four sites and six clinical tests were performed: tear break up time (TBUT), lower lid staining, lower lid roughness, corneal staining, meibomian gland expression (MGE), and meibography of upper and lower eyelids. The Pult Scale was used for grading of Meibomian gland atrophy (MGA). The sample was then divided into two groups: one with MGE less than grade 1 (opaque, low viscosity) and MGE ≥ 1. Unpaired t-tests were used to determine differences.\n\nResults:\nThere were 42 subjects (31 female, 14 male). Average age was 35.6 ± 14.6. Symptoms were significantly different between the two groups for lower lid staining (p=0.043), TBUT (p=0.016), MGA upper lid (p=0.016) and MGA lower lid (p < 0.001). Lower lid roughness and corneal staining were not statistically different.\n\nConclusion(s):\nGently expressing the lower eyelid meibomian glands can be powerful in gauging the expressibility and day to day function of these specialized glands. As an objective test, it was found to be in agreement with three of five clinical tests. It is also minimally invasive, fast, and inexpensive. All in all, MGE was found to be an ideal candidate as the dry eye test to die for.","title":"Is Meibomian Gland Expression the Test to Die For?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175283\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern California College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Clare Halleran, Jennifer Harthan, Milton Hom\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Private practice Clarenville NL Canada, Illinois College of Optometry, Private practice Azusa CA\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

As much as 60% of dry eye may be attributable to meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Multiple treatments are available to address MGD. The aim of this study is compare/contrast the efficacy of 2 established MGD treatments (hot compresses/lid scrubs) versus each other and a relatively new treatment (Blephex) for MGD.\n\nMethods:\nThirty-two subjects with dry eyes were randomized into three different treatment groups. These groups were given either lid scrubs, hot compresses or Blephex therapy. Baseline values were measured of signs, using the (NIKTBUT-non-invasive keratograph tear-break up time) and symptoms, using the Ocular Surface Disease Index survey (OSDI). Therapy was instituted and these measures were repeated after two and four weeks.\n\nResults:\nThe OSDI for all three treatment groups improved from baseline to week four as follows: Blephex (45.8%), Oasis heat mask (30.5%) and Ocusoft lid scrubs (23.4%). Although all groups improved the OSDI, only the Blephex group was determined to be statistically significant between baseline and the week four visit (p=0.031). Paradoxically, all treatment groups had a negative effect on the NIKTBUT. The following decreases were noted at week four: Blephex (14.6%), Oasis heat mask (23.0%) and Ocusoft lid scrubs (4.0%). While the decreases were not statistically significant, this measure is in stark contrast to the observed reduction across the board in patient symptoms.\n\nConclusion(s):\nFor all groups, dry eye symptoms were less post-treatment than at baseline. The Blephex group decreased the OSDI most and it was the only treatment that was statistically significant. All groups unexpectedly experienced a negative impact on their NIKTBUT, Oasis heat mask being the worst. All three treatments are worthy of consideration to minimize dry eye symptoms. However, further study is warranted due to the inexplicable negative effects on the tear layer in all groups.","title":"A Comparative Study of the Efficacy of 3 Different Treatments for Dry Eye","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175284\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Tyler Jevne, Thomas Gall, Pierce Kenworthy\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Midwestern University, Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The use of cosmetics is also common in this subset of the population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate any correlation between patient self-reported ocular comfort with cosmetic use and clinical signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.\n\nMethods:\nThis was a multicenter study with data collection from five centers, four clinical sites in the United States and one in Canada. Patients were asked to rate their ocular comfort when wearing eye cosmetics on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being “extremely comfortable” and 1 being “not comfortable”. Symptoms of dry eye disease were evaluated using the OSDI, SPEED and UNC DEM questionnaires. Clinicians evaluated five clinical signs of dry eye vital dye staining and evaluation of the corneal and conjunctival tissue, TBUT, meibomian gland expression and meibography. Pearson correlation and frequency analyses were completed.\n\nResults:\n25 patients were enrolled, 100% female with a mean age of 31.3 years (range 15-57). The overall patient reported comfort score was 6.68 + 2.51. A moderate correlation was found between ocular comfort score with cosmetic use and symptoms using both UNC DEM (p=0.004, r=0.534) and OSDI (p=0.006, r=0.505). &A moderate correlation was found between the ocular comfort score and clinical findings of dry eye disease, lower lid staining with fluorescein(p=0.002, r=0.576). A mild correlation was found between the ocular comfort score with cosmetic use and symptoms based on SPEED (p=0.11, r=0.26).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis study demonstrated both clinical signs and symptoms of dry eye disease correlated with a decrease in ocular comfort reported by patients using cosmetics. Lower lid staining is an important diagnostic test for cosmetic wearing patients. Further studies are needed looking at larger cohorts of patients.","title":"Evaluation of Ocular Comfort for Eye Make Up Wearers and the Correlation to Dry Eye Symptoms and Clinical Findings","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175285\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Director, Dry Eye Center of PA at Wheatlyn Eye Care\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jennifer Harthan, Clare Halleran, Scott Schwartz, Milton Hom\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Faculty - ICO, Private practice - Canada, Private practice, Private practice - CA\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Current over-the-counter vasoconstrictors used to reduce ocular redness are limited by rebound redness upon treatment discontinuation. Here, we examined rebound redness in two clinical studies evaluating brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.025% for the reduction of ocular redness.\n\nMethods:\nBoth studies were single-center, double-masked, safety and efficacy studies. Subjects ≥18 years of age with baseline redness scores >1 (0-4 scale) but otherwise normal ocular health were randomized 2:1 to treatment with brimonidine or vehicle. Treatments were instilled bilaterally QID for 4 weeks, and subjects completed 3 on- and 1 post-treatment study visits. Rebound redness was assessed in the week following treatment cessation by both investigator and subjects.\n\nResults:\nIn the first study (N=57 subjects), no subjects experienced rebound (ocular redness greater than baseline) after treatment cessation. Mean (SD) redness scores in the brimonidine group (n=38) were 1.70 (0.537) at the follow-up week visit vs 1.82 (0.376) at baseline as assessed by the investigator, while subject diaries for the post-treatment week showed a return to baseline redness scores. In the second study (N=60 subjects), only 1 subject in the brimonidine group (n=40) experienced rebound (ocular redness ≥1 unit compared to baseline) based on investigator assessment, with mean (SD) redness scores of 1.55 (0.51) at the follow-up week visit vs 1.82 (0.41) at baseline. Per subject diary data, 4 subjects in the brimonidine group (3 in the vehicle group) experienced rebound redness.\n\nConclusion(s):\nTogether with data from these studies supporting a rapid onset (1 minute post-dose) and long duration (up to 8 hours) of action, brimonidine 0.025% appears to be effective for ocular redness reduction with negligible rebound redness following discontinuation.","title":"Lack of Rebound Redness Following Discontinuation of a Low-Dose Formulation of Brimonidine (0.025%)","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175286\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Christine Sanfilippo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Bausch & Lomb\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The intranasal tear neurostimulator (ITN, TrueTear™, Allergan plc) has been shown to temporarily increase tear production in dry eye. This study was conducted to quantify total tear lipid and total protein concentrations following activation of the nasolacrimal pathway with the ITN.\n\nMethods:\nFifty-five subjects with dry eye were enrolled in a single-arm study and used the ITN for approximately 3 minutes. Tear volume was assessed by tear meniscus height (TMH) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) prior to and immediately following ITN use. Up to 10 µL of tears were collected in a capillary tube prior to and 5 minutes after the ITN application. Total lipid and total protein concentrations were determined using a modified spectrophotometric sulfo-phospho-vanillin reaction and micro-bicinchoninic acid protein assay, respectively. Mean difference in OCT was analyzed using paired t-test. Mean difference in total lipid and total protein concentrations were evaluated by determining an equivalence margin and comparing the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean difference to the margin.\n\nResults:\nMean (± standard deviation [SD]) post-stimulation TMH (634.9 ± 471.2 µm) was significantly higher than pre-stimulation (238.4 ± 131.9 µm; P < 0.001). Mean ± SD pre- and post-stimulation total lipid concentrations were 0.391 ± 0.30 µg/µL and 0.375 ± 0.25 µg/µL and protein concentrations were 12.7 ± 5.0 μg/μL and 12.0 ± 4.1 μg/μL, respectively.

Previous studies have shown that debridement-scaling of the lid margin improves symptoms and signs of MGD. BlephEx allows lid margin debridement without using a surgical instrument. Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (such as Matrix Metalloproteinase MMP-9) at the ocular surface is well known in dry eye patients. The RPS InflammaDry recognizes elevated levels of MMP-9. This study investigates if MMP-9 levels change following lid debridement with BlephEx.\n\nMethods:\nEleven MGD patients (6 male, 5 female) with evaporative dry eye (Age range 25 to 57; mean age 29.7+/- 9.15) participated in this study. The OSDI, NITBUT, RPS Inflammadry and Meibography grading (Pult grading scheme; Oculus 5M Keratograph) were performed prior to and four weeks after BlephEx treatment. Data was analyzed by a t-test with post hoc test for significance.\n\nResults:\nAll patients had a significant (p < 0.001) reduction of symptoms four weeks after BlephEx treatment with baseline OSDI score reducing from 31.32 +/- 16.48 to 13.13 +/- 8.10. The NITBUT improved significantly (p < 0.01) from a baseline of 6.86 +/- 2.87 seconds to 9.27 +/-2.33 seconds posttreatment. Meibography grades did not change significantly (pre-treatment Grade 1.5 to grade 1.35 posttreatment). Ten patients tested positive for MMP-9 on the RPS InflammaDry before BlephEx treatment. All ten patients were negative for MMP-9 at four weeks post-BlephEx treatment.\n\nConclusion(s):\nAs we have shown before, lid margin debridement, using the BlephEx, consistently improves MGD symptomatology as well as tear break-up times. In the current study, MMP-9 marker was negative (based on the Inflammadry test) at 4 weeks post-BlephEx treatment in ten patients. The betterment in symptoms and signs in these patients can possibly be explained by the reduction in ocular surface inflammation. Therefore, lid margin debridement may offer significant benefits to MGD patients.","title":"Lid Margin Debridement Decreases Inflammatory Marker MMP-9 in the Tear Fluid","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175291\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Keisha Brown, Bao Thach Ngo, Kaylynn Poyner, Charles Connor, William Miller\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Univ Incarnate Word Rosenberg Sch of Optometry, Univ Incarnate Word Rosenberg Sch of Optometry, Univ Incarnate Word Rosenberg Sch of Optometry, Univ Incarnate Word Rosenberg Sch of Optometry, Univ Incarnate Word Rosenberg Sch of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

All images were subjectively assessed by a single-masked investigator to determine the amount of MG loss using Arita et al’s 4-point meiboscore grading scale. The images were also semi-objectively analyzed with ImageJ to calculate the percentage of MG dropout by tracing around the non-glandular area and the total exposed area of the lower lid. Paired t-tests were used to compare the meiboscore and percentage dropout obtained with ImageJ analysis between LVII and K5M. The limits of agreement (LOA) for meiboscore and percentage dropout were assessed with Bland-Altman plots.\n\nResults:\nTwenty participants (mean age 37 years, range 23 - 60, 60% female) completed the study. A significant difference in meiboscore (mean ± SD) was obtained between LVII and K5M (1.43 ± 0.78 vs. 1.90 ± 0.81, t = -4.2, p = 0.0002). The meiboscore 95% LOA ranged from -1.88 to +0.93. A significant difference was found with ImageJ percentage dropout (mean) between LVII and K5M (31.5% vs 43.4%, t = -4.8, p = 0.00003). The percentage dropout 95% LOA ranged from -42.79% to +19.06%.\n\nConclusion(s):\nLVII images had significantly lower meiboscores and less percentage MG dropout than those obtained with K5M. Varying amounts of dropout were observed with the LVII Lid Everter because less of the eyelid was everted than with the K5M and digital manipulation, and due to differences in image quality between the devices. Due to the large amount of disagreement in percentage dropout, it is recommended that these devices cannot be used interchangeably in a clinical setting to assess MG dropout.","title":"Comparison of Meibomian Gland Dropout using Two Infrared Imaging Devices","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175292\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sruthi Srinivasan, Lyndon Jones, Paul Murphy\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Contact Lens Research, Centre for Contact Lens Research, University of Waterloo Cardiff University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Measurements of lipid layer thickness (LLT) were repeated 15 minutes after the eye drops were instilled. Data were collected over a central 6mm diameter field (resolution 1400x1100, 23 frames/s) over 40 seconds. Before each measurement, subjects completed a Current Symptoms Survey (CSS) which utilized a visual analog scale (VAS) indicating their current eye symptoms for burning/stinging, grittiness/foreign body sensation, dryness, blurry/fluctuating vision, and overall ocular pain/discomfort.\n\nResults:\nThe average LLT was measured over the 6mm diameter field, and in three zones (superior, central and inferior thirds). Comparing the LLT at baseline and 15 minutes after the instillation of the eye drop revealed the following: LLT of the inferior third at increased 9.12nm ±17.46nm; LLT of the central third increased 8.08nm±10.58nm; LLT of the superior third increased 5.38nm±14.04nm; LLT of the overall field increased 7.82nm±11.14nm.

This study aimed to determine, in subjects with symptoms of dry eye disease (DED), the frequency and severity of staining presenting in each of five geographic regions of the cornea (central, superior, nasal, inferior & temporal) by retrospective review of data from clinical studies conducted at the Centre for Contact Lens Research.\n\nMethods:\nData from the baseline assessment of 13 DED studies were included in the analysis (OD only) using inclusion criteria of an OSDI score >12 and corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) assessment for the 5 zones separately. For each subject, the corneal zones were ranked by the relative severity of the staining grades. The zone with the highest grade was designated Rank-1, through to the least severe staining as Rank-5. Equal grades were given the same rank. The frequency of Rank-1 incidence was determined for each zone.\n\nResults:\nThe sample comprised 368 subjects across all eligible studies. Mean OSDI score was 33.4 (median 31.3; 12.5-93.8). The proportional frequency of Rank-1 being assigned for each zone was: inferior 52.5% (n=193); nasal 20.9% (n=77); temporal 18.8% (n=69); superior 17.1% (n=63) and central 12.8% (n=47). The distribution of the observed data was tested against a model where the probability of staining arising in any zone was equal (H\n0\n), and was rejected (Multinomial LLR: p<0.001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nCFS is commonly listed as a key outcome to show treatment efficacy for DED therapies and may use staining grades for the cornea (central zone or as a whole) for study entry and/or outcome analysis. This study clearly shows that the inferior zone most commonly exhibits the most severe staining.

The purpose of this study was to measure sensory thresholds before and after repeated TFI, using prolonged eye opening (STARE) to induce TFI.\n\nMethod:\nTwenty subjects participated in the study. Detection thresholds to cool stimuli were measured using a computerized Belmonte esthesiometer before, immediately after and 30 minutes after subjects completed 10 consecutive STARE trials. They also completed a Current Symptom Questionnaire (CSQ) after threshold measurement.

Considering the invasive and disruptive nature of fluorescein, a non-invasive (NIBUT) method is preferred. The purpose of this study was to assess if the NIBUT measurement is instrument and examiner dependent.\n\nMethods:\nFive instruments (Placido disc, Oculus; Medmont corneal topographer, model E300; Keratograph 5M, Oculus; Tearscope, Keeler (with both small and larger grid pattern) were used for comparison on participants by 2 examiners.\n\nResults:\nParticipants (n=20, mean age 24.6±3.2 yrs, 9M:11F, OSDI values <23/100) were tested three times for each instrument by two examiners. When compared to the Tearscope with the small grid (NIBUT 10.4±5.8sec), two instruments gave significantly shorter values (p < 0.05), notably the Keratograph (8.5±4.8sec) and topographer (7.5±3.4sec), with the later approaching a greater significance (p≈0.00). No significant difference was noted between the Placido and the two Tearscope grids. No significant difference was noted between the two examiners (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusion:\nThis study noted that the NIBUT can be instrument dependent but not observer dependent.

While commercial cleansing wipes offer some symptomatic control, weekly application of a 50% tea tree oil solution, remains the recognised treatment in more persistent cases, although this can cause intense ocular irritation. The antibacterial effects of an alpha-cyclodextrin enhanced MGO™ Manuka Honey eye cream, (Manuka Health NZ), with proven safety and tolerablity in human studies, are well established and exceed the effects of Manuka honey alone. This study sought to evaluate the effect of this cyclodextrin-complexed Manuka honey eye cream on the viability of Demodex, in vitro.\n\nMethods:\nDemodex (n=52) extracted from the epilated lashes of affected individuals were randomized to treatment with uncomplexed Manuka honey (Manuka Health NZ), complexed Manuka Honey eye cream, or 50% tea tree oil. Mite survival times, assessed according to mite movement and morphology, were analysed with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, followed by log rank testing of differences in mite survival distributions between treatment groups.\n\nResults:\nNo statistically significant difference (p=0.812) in survival distribution was established between treatments with complexed Manuka honey and 50% tea tree oil. Manuka honey complexed with α-cyclodextrin was significantly more effective than Manuka Honey alone (p<0.001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nComplexation with α-cyclodextrin enhances the anti-parasitic effect of Manuka honey against Demodex.

Eye make-up may aggravate an already dry eye, contributing to increased tear evaporation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of make-up wear on self-reported ocular comfort and on the ocular surface.\n\nMethods:\nSixteen investigator-designed questions related to ocular comfort, make-up wear and dry eye were administered to patients at four clinical sites in the United States and one in Canada. Clinical tests performed included Meibomian gland expression and PULT classification of Meibomian gland atrophy.\n\nResults:\n45 subjects were enrolled, 55.5% (25/45) wore make-up on or around the eye an average of 5.08 + 2.25 days/week and removed their make-up 3.56 + 0.96 days/week. The average self-reported ocular comfort score for make-up wearers was 6.68 + 2.51 (scale of 1 to 10, 10 being most comfortable). Patients who wore make-up less and removed it more often showed a positive correlation to their perceived ocular comfort (r=0.45, p=0.03; r=0.15, p= < 0.001). Comfort scores also showed a moderate correlation with the PULT severity levels of MG atrophy for the lower lids (r=0.21, p < 0.001; r=0.19, p < 0.001). With lower levels of MG expression for the right and left eyes, comfort increased (r=-0.11, p < 0.001; r=-0.17, p < 0.001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nMake-up may worsen dry eye signs and symptoms. As patients wore make-up less often and removed more frequently, comfort scores improved. A positive correlation was found between patients’ perceived comfort scores and severity level of MG atrophy.

Children with dyslexia (DYS) and low vision (LV) have difficulty learning to read. Research has demonstrated that specific font characteristics and text formats may improve reading speed and comprehension for individuals with DYS and LV. We evaluated if childrens books are being published to be visually accessible for DYS and LV patients.\n\nMethods:\nOne hundred, 2nd and 3rd grade level books were randomly sampled from the public library. Font type, font size, line separation, letter separation, paper quality, and contrast were measured and compared to criteria established by past research. Frequency analysis was performed to assess the number of LV and DYS criteria books met. Analysis of variance was performed to determine if criterion met significantly varied with publisher or date of publication.\n\nResults:\nAnalysis revealed a mean font size of 10.62pt, a mean line spacing of 4.5mm, and a mean date of publication of 2011. There were not any books that met all six criteria for either LV or DYS patients. For LV criteria, 1% of books met only 1 of 6 criteria, 10% met 2 of 6, 66% met 3 of 6, 21% met 4 of 6, and 2% met 5 of 6 criteria. For DYS criteria, 2% of books met only 1 of 6 criteria, 21% met 2 of 6, 48% met 3 of 6, 22% met 4 of 6, and 7% met 5 of 6 criteria. LV and DYS criterion met did not vary significantly by publisher (p > 1) or by date of publication (p > 1).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe majority of the books only met 3 of 6 criterion for both LV and DYS. There were not any publishers that were determined to be formatting their books significantly better for LV or DYS than any other publishers. No significant improvements in accessible formatting have been made in the last 15 years. Overall, the data suggests that there remains significant room for formatting improvement within the childrens books publishing industry.","title":"Evaluation of Visually Accessible Formatting Characteristics in Children’s Books","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175263\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Caitlyn Reynolds, Jeffrey Weaver\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UMSL, n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects were required to be 18 years of age or older. Qualifying subjects were asked to complete an online survey (Qualtrics) about myopia knowledge, health care utilization, access to insurance, and demographics. SAS was used to calculate frequencies and percentages and to assess predictors of myopia knowledge with logistic regression.\n\nResults:\nThis study included 330 participants, and 66.4% of them chose the correct definitions for nearsightedness and myopia. Some subjects (6.7%) chose incorrect definitions, but the same definition for both suggesting that these subjects understood that nearsightedness and myopia are synonymous. Seventy-four participants chose the correct definition for nearsightedness but not myopia, while only 10 chose the correct definition for myopia but not nearsightedness. While information related to age, income, education, insurance for eye care, and timing of last eye exam was surveyed, only age was a significant predictor of the knowledge that myopia is associated with other eye conditions, which was answered positively by 51.8% of respondents. Respondents less than 45 years of age had a 2.18 times (95% confidence limits = 1.37, 3.48) greater odds of knowing this association compared to the odds of respondents 45 years of age or older.\n\nConclusion(s):\nWhile most subjects correctly defined myopia and nearsightedness, those who did not were more likely to understand the term nearsightedness, which should be considered when educating patients. The health literacy results obtained in this study may be an overestimation of health literacy since 90% of respondents have recently had an eye exam. Results also suggest that more education is needed so that the emerging methods of myopia prevention can be best utilized.","title":"Patient Understanding of Nearsightedness","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175264\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Stephanie Cox, Andrew Pucker\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The severity of the presentation requires surgical intervention for the glaucoma. PA is a congenital disorder resulting in abnormal development of the anterior segment. 50-70% of patients with PA have glaucoma. Evaluation noted bilateral corneal opacities due to incomplete separation of the cornea from the iris. The corneal opacity OS is larger and more significant than that OD . Evaluation reveals minimal fixation and no ability to track an object. B scan reveals that the lens is not adhered to the cornea thus likely a Type I Peters Anomaly. Dilated fundus examination reveals normal optic nerve head appearance. Repeated IOP measurements of high 20s OD and high 40s OS are noted. An IET is present in the left eye.  The associated ocular findings of microphthalmos, iris hypoplasia, aniridia, coloboma and optic disc hypoplasia do not appear to be present. No observable systemic defects have been detected in this patient. The two months of optometric care focused on controlling IOP and minimizing the risk of amblyopia. Muro 128 was rxed to treat the corneal edema, the combination of Cosopt and Latanoprost proved most effective in controlling IOP. 0.5% Cyclopentalate was installed daily to allow for expansion of the visual axis around the central opacities. Occlusion therapy was prescribed to address concerns of amblyopia development. A referral was made for evaluation by glaucoma and corneal specialists. After surgical intervention is complete Low Vision evaluation will address the patient’s refractive and overall visual needs.  The clinical and systemic features of Peters Anomaly differ from case to case. Bilateral Peters Anomaly is often associated with systemic malformations and increased ocular severity. Optometric care presents a path to directly treat the disease as well as prepare a future for development of the patient’s best visual potential.","title":"Optometric Care of an Infant with Bilateral Peters Anomaly and Congenital Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175266\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Punita Kapadia, Julie Lafreniere\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Tallahassee VA, Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

However there are no published reports of the impact of congenital cataract on the caregiver’s QoL. Therefore the aim of this study was to examine changes in the caregiver’s QoL after surgery for congenital cataract.\n\nMethods\n: 276 caregivers (79% mothers; mean age, 28.9 years) of children with congenital cataract (55% boys; median age, 3.3 years) scheduled to undergo congenital cataract surgery were included. Two hundred and nineteen children (79%) had bilateral congenital cataract. All the caregivers completed the 20-item Caregiver QoL questionnaire (CarQoL) preoperatively and at 6-8 weeks postoperatively. In addition, caregivers rated their overall QoL using a single item. Psychometric properties of CarQoL questionnaire were assessed and Rasch-scaled scores (in logits) of the CarQoL were used for all analyses.\n\nResults\n: CarQoL scores were significantly higher postoperatively (preoperative CarQoL score [mean ± SD], 1.45 ± 1.42 vs postoperative score 2.69 ± 1.53 logits; P < 0.0001). The magnitude of change in the caregiver’s QoL was large (Cohen’s d = 0.83 [95% CI, 0.50, 1.05]). Using the single overall QoL item, 67% reported their QoL to be poor/very poor preoperatively compared to 8% postoperatively. However, 21% of the caregivers reported their QoL to be good/very good preoperatively compared to 79% postoperatively (p<0.0001).\n\nConclusion(s)\n: Congenital cataract in a child has adverse impacts on his/her caregiver’s QoL.

The curvature was determined as the area under the curved MG and a straight tangent connecting its two ends.\n\nResults:\nThe mean length of the upper (7.10 ± 1.48 mm) and lower (2.92 ± 0.59 mm) MGs was significantly different (p  < 0.001). Similarly, the mean width of the superior (0.44 ± 0.08 mm) and inferior (0.63 ± 0.10 mm) MG was also different (p <0.001). No significant difference was noted for length and width between age groups. The curvature was greater in the upper lid (p < 0.01). A significant difference (p=0.04) was noted between the curvatures in the younger group (upper 1.81 ± 1.02 mm\n2\n, lower 0.30 ± 0.18 mm\n2\n) versus the older group (upper 0.93 ± 0.50 mm\n2\n, lower 0.24 ± 0.15 mm\n2\n). No significant correlation existed between any morphological parameters of the MG and NIBUT, however the strongest correlation (R=0.682) existed with the length of inferior MG in the older group. NIBUT decreased with age by 2.70 ± 0.94 sec, however this did not reach significance (p=0.06). Stringent criteria restricted recruitment for the older group.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis study confirms what is already well known, namely concerning the length and width of the MG in the upper and lower lids. The increased curvature of MG observed the younger group brings about a new element, which needs to be corroborated with a larger sample size.","title":"Age-related Morphologic Changes of Meibomian Glands in Men","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175269\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Maude Beauregard, Etty Bitton\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        École d'optométrie Université de Montréal, École d'optométrie Université de Montréal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study was to optimize a method to quantify the amount of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) found in the tear film.\n\nMethods:\nBasal and flush tears (following instillation of 20 microliters of saline on the ocular surface) of 7 healthy participants were collected from the right and left eyes respectively, using a microcapillary method on day 1. On day 2, the same procedure was repeated. CGRP concentration in the tears was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The ELISA kit was tested for specificity and sensitivity as per manufacturer’s guidelines and the experiment was repeated three times to determine reproducibility. The limit of detection was based on the variance of the blank samples and the variance of the lowest level of each individual tear samples added.\n\nResults:\nThe amount of CGRP concentration in basal tears was found to be 2.72 ± 1.18 ng/ml on day 1 and 3.48 ± 1.18 ng/ml on day 2. The amount of CGRP in flush tears was found to be 3.19 ± 1.50 ng/ml and 2.50 ± 1.31 ng/ml on days 1 and 2 respectively. There was no significant difference between the basal and flush tears for day 1 (p = 0.59) or day 2 (p = 0.22). Repeated measures ANOVA showed no statistical difference between basal tears for days 1 and 2, (p = 0.08) or for flush tears for days 1 and 2 (p = 0.32). The limit of detection of the kit was found to be 0.33 ng/ml.\n\nConclusion(s):\nELISA is a sensitive method that can be adopted to quantify CGRP in the human tear film. The optimized technique can be used to identify differences in CGRP levels in patients with contact lens discomfort and varying degrees of dry eye.","title":"Method Optimization to Quantify Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) in Human Tear Film","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175270\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lakshman Subbaraman, Negar Omali, Sruthi Srinivasan, Lyndon Jones\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Contact Lens Research University of Waterloo, Centre for Contact Lens Research University of Waterloo, Centre for Contact Lens Research University of Waterloo, Centre for Contact Lens Research University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This novel eye drop provides a new dry eye treatment option for both the symptoms and signs of dry eye. Symptomatic approval was based on clinical trials evaluating subjects eye dryness score (EDS) based on the visual analogue scale (VAS) with 0 = no discomfort and 100 = maximal discomfort as well as improvement to Inferior Corneal Staining Score (ICSS). While relevant, these metrics are not commonly used indicators in clinic to monitor dry eye disease. This retrospective study evaluated patient dry eye evaluations to analyze trends in signs and symptoms after initiation of Lifitegrast 5% BID OU. Data evaluation included dry eye test results more commonly used in today’s clinical settings than those used in the clinical trials, including symptom questionnaires SPEED and OSDI, as well as tear osmolarity and meibomian gland expression.\n\nMethods:\nThis study looked at retrospective patient data of 21 subjects with a 16:5 F:M ratio and median age 52 years old. Data analyzed included SPEED and OSDI scores, as well as tear osmolarity with the TearLab system. Meibomian gland expression was done on the lower lids utilizing the Meibomian Gland Evaluator by TearScience with the protocol described by Dr. Donald Korb et al. Data was compared for the initial evaluation and the first follow-up after initiation of Lifitegrast.\n\nResults:\nWith a median follow-up period of 30 days after initiation of Lifitegrast, both SPEED and OSDI symptom scores improved, 27% and 17.4% respectively. Tear osmolarity increased by 2% on average OU but was clinically insignificant. Meibomian gland expression increased 54% on average OU.\n\nConclusion(s):\nPatients prescribed Lifitegrast 5% for treatment of dry eye disease had both symptomatic and sign improvement during a short follow-up period when evaluating SPEED, OSDI, and MGE scores. There was no clinically significant change to tear osmolarity. Future studies would evaluate a larger subject pool as well as long-term results with the medication.","title":"The Short-Term Impact of Lifitegrast on Dry Eye Symptoms, Meibomian Gland Expression, and Tear Osmolarity","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175271\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Puget Sound Eye Care\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        April Chiu, David Kading\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Specialty Eyecare Group, Specialty Eyecare Group\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Two multicenter studies were conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of the ITN in increasing acute tear production in subjects with dry eye.\n\nMethods:\nStudy 1 was a double-masked, 1-day, crossover trial in 48 subjects who received 3 test applications in a randomized sequence: active intranasal, extranasal (active control), and sham intranasal (inactive control). The primary effectiveness outcome was the difference in Schirmer scores between active and control extranasal and sham applications. Study 2 was an open-label, 180-day, single-arm trial in which 97 subjects were asked to perform intranasal neurostimulation 2 to 10 times/day. The primary effectiveness outcome was the difference in unstimulated versus ITN stimulated Schirmer scores at day 180. ITN application was performed for up to 3 minutes in both studies. The primary safety measure in both studies was assessment of device-related adverse events (AEs).\n\nResults:\nIn study 1, significantly greater acute tear production was observed during active intranasal application vs control applications (mean ± standard deviation [SD] Schirmer scores: 25.3 ± 10.7 mm vs 9.5 ± 8.2 mm [extranasal] and 9.2 ± 7.3 mm [sham]; P < 0.0001 for both). In study 2, mean Schirmer test scores were significantly higher with ITN versus unstimulated scores at day 180 (17.3 ± 12.0 mm vs 7.9 ± 6.4 mm; P < 0.0001).

In New Zealand, ROP is one of the most common causes of preventable childhood blindness. Since 2006, infants in Auckland, New Zealand, at risk of developing ROP have been screened by wide-field digital imaging via telemedicine. This prospective observational study aimed to report the medium to long-term visual outcomes of infants who have undergone this screening.\n\nMethods:\nA retrospective review of the Auckland ROP database from May 2008 to October 2011 identified 274 eligible children. All participants received a comprehensive paediatric optometric examination including cycloplegic autorefraction, retinal assessment and wide-field retinal imaging. All retinal images were reviewed by a paediatric ophthalmologist.\n\nResults:\nA total of 125 children were able to be contacted and 69 children, aged 5 to 8 years were examined: 44 had a history of ROP, 7 of whom required treatment for type 1 ROP. Infants with ROP had significantly lower gestational age (26.6 ± 1.9 vs. 29.1 ± 1.6 weeks,\np\n< 0.001) and birth weight (937 ± 237 vs. 1177 ± 311 grams,\np\n= 0.001).

Clinical features can include telecanthus, iris and choroidal hypopigmentation, sensorineural hearing loss, and a white forelock of hair. Typically it is an autosomal dominant condition, with incomplete penetrance, thus giving a wide variety of clinical presentations even within the same family. Multiple mutations have been linked with WS, and there are four distinct types differentiated from each other both clinically and genetically.\n\nCase Report:\nAn 11 year old African American female presented for first eye exam with a complaint of blurry distance vision. She had a history of Type 1 diabetes, congenital deafness, and Grave’s disease. Examination was significant for moderate myopia which corrected vision to 20/20 in each eye, blue irides, and broad areas of choroidal pigmentary changes in both eyes. Upon questioning, patient had a white forelock when younger, and pedigree revealed various phenotypic presentations in the family. At the follow up, retinal OCT imaging was normal and anterior segment and fundus photos showed stability. This phenotype of iris and choroidal hypopigmentation along with congenital deafness meets diagnostic criteria for Waardenburg Syndrome, and was previously undiagnosed in this patient. Patient was referred to genetics for genetic counselling.\n\nDiscussion:\nWaardenburg syndrome varies in its degree of ocular involvement. This case highlights the striking appearance when both the anterior and posterior uvea is affected. On review of the literature, no previously reported associations between WS and endocrine disorders were found, but the genetics of WS are continuing to be established. Ocular manifestations are an important diagnostic finding in a multitude of genetic syndromes, thus priming Optometry for a role in coordination of care in these patients.","title":"Ocular Manifestations and Diagnosis of Waardenburg Syndrome in 11 Year Old Female with History of Congenital Deafness and Endocrine Disorders","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175261\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Non-Cycloplegic Retinoscopy (NCR), when performed by eye care professionals, had the highest sensitivity of 11 screening tests in the Vision in Preschoolers (VIP) study. This study compared the effectiveness of a simplified NCR procedure to the Bruckner test in screening for amblyogenic factors in children.\n\nMethods:\nThe\n\nBruckner and NCR were performed on 108 patients examined in the UCBSO pediatric and special needs (SVAC) clinic by a rising second year optometry student. A decision for a screening pass or refer was made immediately after each test was performed. This included bilateral dark or asymmetric red eye reflexes for the Bruckner and a dark, slow retinoscopy reflex and/or asymmetric reflexes between eyes or between meridians within either eye for NCR. The patients then received a comprehensive eye exam and the sensitivity, specificity, and phi coefficient of each screening test was calculated.\n\nResults:\nFrom the clinical examination, 37 of 64 young children < 5 years and SVAC patients combined (Group 1), and 25 of 44 older (6-13 years) pediatric patients (Group 2) had one or more of the targeted conditions (strabismus, anisometropia, high astigmatism or high ametropia). For Group 1, the Bruckner and NCR had specificities of 89%, with sensitivities of 35% and 59% respectively. For Group 2, the Bruckner had 52% sensitivity with 100% specificity, and NCR had 80% sensitivity with 95% specificity.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe Bruckner and NCR can effectively screen for amblyogenic factors in children. Training non-eye care professionals to perform these tests may broaden their implementation during annual pediatric medical exams or school screenings.","title":"The Bruckner Reflex Versus Non-Cycloplegic Retinoscopy as Screening Tools for Amblyogenic Factors in Children","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175262\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Deborah Orel-Bixler, Anne Tasaki, Sarah Fisher\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UCBSO, UCBSO, UCBSO\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Due to reduced parameters offered in soft contact lenses and poor optical quality of high plus spectacles, both options are limited. Large diameter scleral gas permeable lenses (SCLs) are a great option for pediatrics because they are stable on the eye, thus, not easily dislodged, and are available in most any parameter. This case report discusses two pediatric aphakic patients corrected with SCLs.\n\nMethods:\nThis case report refers to two aphakic pediatric patients who were successfully fitted into SCLs. The first patient was a ten-month-old Caucasian female with unilateral aphakia due to removal of congenital anterior polar cataract in the left eye. The second patient, a five-year-old Caucasian female with bilateral aphakia due to the removal of congenital posterior subcapsular cataracts caused by systemic Rhizomelic Chrondrodysplasia Punctata. Aphakic correction was attempted but not successful with both silicone elastomer and corneal gas permeable contact lenses. High plus spectacles were not considered for full time correction in either patient since the poor optical quality is a barrier to binocular fusion. SCLs were successfully fitted on the affected eyes of both patients to correct for aphakia.\n\nResults:\nThe follow-up period was 6 and 24 months for the first and second patient respectively. The patients were seen every 8 weeks within the follow-up period. The patients wore their SCLs for 12 hours a day and were removed nightly. No adverse events happened during the follow-up period.\n\nConclusion(s):\nSCLs provide clear optics and stable vision correction in aphakic children. SCLs should be considered as an alternative to small diameter contact lenses and spectacles for vision correction in pediatric aphakia.","title":"Scleral Gas Permeable Lenses for Correction of Pediatric Aphakia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175253\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kristen Pratt, Melanie Frogozo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry, Alamo Eye Care- Contact Lens Institute of San Antonio\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

It is characterized by episodic hyperpnea, abnormal eye movements, ataxia, and developmental delay. Ocular findings vary and can include hypometric saccades, impaired smooth pursuits, oculomotor apraxia, strabismus, and nystagmus.\n\nCase Report:\nAn 8 year old female was referred to our clinic for a binocular vision and visual information processing (VIP) exam. Her medical history was remarkable for Joubert syndrome and developmental delays. Her ocular history was remarkable for isometropic amblyopia due to high myopia. Exam results showed reduced VA OU, accommodative insufficiency,  and no strabismus. No nystagmus was present. EOMs were full but jerky, saccadic testing showed consistent undershoots, and she had great difficulty maintaining fixation during pursuit testing.  VIP testing showed below average performance in all visual spatial, visual analysis, and visual motor integration skills with the exception sequential memory.\n\nDiscussion and/or Conclusion(s):\nThis case presents the binocular vision, oculomotor, and VIP findings in a patient with Joubert syndrome. Oculomotor findings are consistent with case reports and studies previously published. Visual information processing deficits associated Joubert syndrome are not widely published.

The patient’s age, gender, race, distance visual acuity, refractive error, and the presence of amblyopia and strabismus were obtained.\n\nResults:\nA total of 140 children were examined because they failed a vision screening. Of those children, 85 (60.7%) were found to have a clinically significant vision disorder: myopia: n=20; hyperopia: n=35; astigmatism: n=49; anisometropia: n= 27; amblyopia: n=37; and/or strabismus: n=10. Several children with clinically significant refractive error had up to 3 refractive error diagnoses (1: n=37; 2: n=29; 3 n=12). Only 7 children with amblyopia or strabismus did not have clinically significant refractive error. Three children had both amblyopia and strabismus.\n\nConclusion(s):\nRoughly 60% of the patients seen in our office because of a failed vision screening were found to have a significant vision disorder as defined in this study. Uncorrected astigmatism was the most common clinically significant refractive error detected. Eighty-five percent of the children diagnosed with amblyopia and/or strabismus also had clinically significant refractive error. Our results indicate there is need for improvement in vision screening methodology and implementation to improve the sensitivity and specificity of children’s vision screenings.","title":"Children Diagnosed with a Clinically Significant Vision Disorder after Failing a Vision Screening: A Retrospective Chart Review","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175255\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lillian Prince, Tawna Roberts\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Biostatistics and Research Awareness Network Inc (BRAIN), Akron Children's Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This condition is often severe, chronic and frequently complicated by the systemic workup being idiopathic in up to 60% of cases.\n\nCase Report:\nPatient DM initially presented to clinic in October 2012 with his CC of floaters OU; his medical and ocular history were unremarkable. Exam results found VA: 20/30 OD, 20/25 OS, 2+ anterior uveitis OU, and 3+ intermediate uveitis OU; all remaining ocular structures were WNL. At this time he was started on PF 1% QID and Prednisone 40mg daily. He returned 4 days later with minimal VA improvement: 20/25 OD, 20/25 OD, quiet anterior chamber OU and no improvement in intermediate uveitis OU. Prednisone was increased to 80mg daily and patient DM was referred for a rheumatology workup. One week later DM returned, vision was 20/20 OD, OS, anterior chamber remained quiet and intermediate uveitis was unchanged; at this time DM was placed on Methotrexate. Over the next few months DM's medications were altered to achieve remission of his inflammation. Three months later DM was completely quiet on Methotrexate and Humira. A slow taper off both of these medication, over a 2 year period, resulted in DM remaining quiet with no systemic medication in August 2016. Unfortunately, in April 2017, DM's inflammation returned OU and he was placed back on only Methotrexate and Humira.\n\nConclusion(s):\nPediatric uveitis patients require a stepwise approach in management, beginning with the administration of steroids to control acute inflammation, followed by immunosuppressive medications when steroids are unable to yield adequate control. It is necessary to coordinate care with a rheumatologist who is comfortable administering immunomodulatory therapy as prolonged steroid treatment is undesirable and leads to long-term systemic consequences.","title":"The Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenges of Pediatric Uveitis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175256\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Children 's Mercy Hosp & Clinic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jamie Weiser\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Children's Mercy\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

There has been no true treatment for keratoconus, until recently with the development of corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL). This case will discuss the mechanism behind corneal crosslinking, the literature supporting pediatric crosslinking and how we as optometrists play a vital role in the implementation of this treatment.\n\nCase Report:\nPatient EJ was initially referred to our clinic September 25th, 2013 due to suspect diagnosis of keratoconus. Examination results found iron lines present on both corneas, positive Munson sign OU, and BCVA OD: 20/40 w/ -3/75+1.75x150 and OS: 20/80 w/ -4.00+1.00 x 050. Topography was performed and confirmed keratoconus diagnosis with Kpi of 100%. An in depth discussion was had with EJ regarding the etiology of his condition and the ability of rigid contact lenses to improve his vision compared to spectacles alone. Patient EJ was successfully fit in Rose K CL with BCVA OD:20/25 and OS:20/30. For 3 years EJ was monitored for keratoconus progression with appropriate updated CL Rx. In August of 2013 progression of his keratoconus was making it difficult to find a successful CL fit. At this point he was referred to our pediatric ophthalmologist for consultation of corneal collagen crosslinking. On February 16th, 2017 EJ underwent CXL OS with continued stable findings today and as a result, he is getting ready to undergo CXL of the right eye.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOptometrists are generally the first to examine and diagnose pediatric keratoconus.

In the absence of pathology, the patient must be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist who can treat the underlying source for psychogenic amblyopia.\n\nPatient CH, an 8 year, 7 month old male, was referred to clinic on 12/14/16 due to concern for decreased vision secondary to a presumed unspecified retinal degeneration. His mother reports the patient’s vision rapidly declined, beginning at approximately age 5. He was receiving special services at school, including a Braille instructor. CH was wearing spectacles with mild astigmatic correction in both eyes. His best corrected distance VA was hand motion in the right eye and 20/300 in the left eye. His near VA was 20/800 in each eye. Patient reported no stereo and reported only seeing the red lights at near and no lights at distance with Worth 4 Dot testing. Cover test was orthophoric. Despite CH’s reported lack of vision, he was able to ambulate around the room easily, made eye contact consistently, and easily grasped objects handed to him. Cycloplegic retinoscopy revealed mild hyperopic astigmatism. CH reported no visual improvement with the cycloplegic correction. Anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination were unremarkable. Tangent screen visual field was attempted, but the patient would not respond. Fundus photos, OCT, ERG, and MRI were performed to rule out ocular or neurologic abnormalities. All testing was unremarkable.Findings were discussed with CH’s parents, and a diagnosis of psychogenic amblyopia was discussed. CH was referred to a psychologist for further examination. A familial source for anxiety was identified and addressed. CH continues care with his psychologist and is reporting improved vision. He is no longer attempting to learn Braille.\n\nThe diagnosis of psychogenic amblyopia can be difficult for some providers to make.

Traditional optometric evaluation of these individuals has included a comprehensive near testing in addition to standard refractive and ocular health assessments. However, a comprehensive history may reveal behaviors and complaints associated with other pathology such as Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), clinical depression, anxiety disorders, toxicities, metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, seizure disorders and sleep disorders. This case illustrates the complexity of diagnosing and treating patients with binocular vision complaints.\n\nCase Report:\nAn 18 YO Caucasian male was referred by his pediatrician to both optometry and ENT to rule out pathology accounting for complaints of “unequal focusing, inability to concentrate, blurred vision, mild dizziness, tinnitus with ear fullness, poor depth perception and frontal headaches.” His ocular health examination was unremarkable, his cycloplegic refraction revealed low hyperopia, a near work up revealed low amplitude of accommodation and convergence insufficiency. Simultaneously, the patient was seen by ENT and had an MRI to rule out semicircular canal fistula. A comprehensive lab panel was performed to rule out underlying systemic disease. Both MRI and lab panel results were normal. The pediatrician began Melatonin for a sleep abnormality and ordered a sleep study. At his follow up visit all subjective symptoms had cleared and his clinical findings fell within the normal ranges on all measures.\n\nConclusion(s):\nTreatment of the patient’ssleep disorders resulted in the resolution of complaints and a notable improvement in patient’s clinical binocular vision findings; highlighting the complexity of patient complaints and need for comprehensive evaluation when additional symptoms are elicited.","title":"Binocular Vision Disorder Resolution with Treatment of Confounding Diagnosis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175259\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Loyola University Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

It results in legal blindness in 400-600 infants born in the US each year, and is most likely to occur in infants born at or before 32 weeks and weighing less than 1500 grams.\n\nCase Report:\nHistory: A 12 year old African American male was referred by school psychologist for evaluation of visual tracking and possible mobility training due to frequently bumping into obstacles and people. He also reported having to look over his glasses and use a very close working distance when reading. He was born at less than 7 months gestation with a birth weight of 1 lb 11 oz. History of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with laser treatment OU, retinal tear OS, retinal detachment and aphakia OD. Findings: Entering acuity was light perception OD and 20/40 OS. Pupils revealed 2+ APD OD. CVF showed constricted field OS and Goldman Perimetry showed less than 20 degrees of central field OS. EOMs were full. Refractive error was -12.25-1.00x110 OS. Accommodative amplitude was 10.00D OS. Developmental Eye Movement Test and NSUCO revealed deficiencies of smooth pursuits and saccadic eye movements. Ocular health evaluation showed corneal opacity and fibrotic retinal detachment OD and Stage 4, Zone 2 ROP OD. Diagnosis and treatment: The patient was diagnosed with oculomotor dysfunction and accommodative insufficiency and enrolled in weekly vision therapy for training of visual tracking, visual scanning, peripheral awareness, and accommodation. Outcomes: The patient is n no longer bumping into obstacles. He has improved tracking and accommodation with an appropriate working distance.\n\nDiscussion:\nVision therapy may be overlooked in monocular patients as they are unable to obtain binocularity. This case highlights the ability to train monocular visual skills and enhance the remaining vision in patients with severe VF loss.","title":"Vision Therapy in a Monocular Child with Retinopathy of Prematurity","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175250\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kaitlyn Kelley, Man Kin Chow\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Patients frequently suffer from developmental delays, epilepsy, behavioral problems, autism, and hearing abnormalities.  Visual complications include a range of visual impairment from mildly reduced to 20/200 or worse. Other visual signs may include: absent fixation, nystagmus, strabismus, poor pursuits/saccades, and optic nerve hypoplasia.  MRI scans confirm a diagnosis.\n\nCase Report:\nWe will present a series of four cases seen with varying age levels and visual acuity reduction. All cases share the diagnosis of SOD diagnosed by an absent septum pellucidum. Three of the four cases have ONH abnormalities. Two of the four share hearing loss and prematurity.  The oldest patient in our series presents with abnormal cover test findings and a dissociated horizontal intermittent strabismus.  She showed an eso deviation in the left eye while manifesting an exo deviation in the right eye through PACT.  Deviation was worse with near fixation and made worse thru near addition lenses. Central left suppression was found and no tertiary stereopsis. Patient was asymptomatic for diplopia, asthenopia, and headaches.  Her myopic prescription was adjusted and bifocal removed.  Photos, OCT, and video documentation of her motilities was performed.\n\nDiscussion:\nCases will be summarized and presented as to their similarities and differences.

The proportion of signal to noise required for form discrimination is the stereo coherence threshold (StereoCT). We evaluated StereoCTs to assess the potential clinical utility of this test.\n\nMethods:\nStimuli were RDS containing disparity defined sinusoidal gratings viewed through LCD shutter goggles. Control participants (n = 10 in each condition) discriminated grating orientation within a 2AFC staircase. Signal to noise or peak-to-peak amplitude of the grating was varied to measure StereoCTs and disparity thresholds, respectively. Binocular vision was degraded by inducing interocular luminance (0.3 to 1.8 log units) or contrast differences (ratios 0.8 to 0.2), uniocular blur (acuity reduction to 0.2 and 0.3 LogMar) or uniocular Bangerter® filters (rated 0.8 and 0.6). Adult participants with amblyopia (n = 4) were also tested and interocular contrast was varied to reduce suppression.\n\nResults:\nWithout binocular disruption, mean disparity thresholds were < 30 arc sec and StereoCTs were 27% coherence. Disparity and StereoCTs deteriorated with interocular differences. For example, StereoCTs were elevated to 66% (± 15%) and disparity thresholds to 176 (± 81) arc sec with uniocular blur to 0.3 LogMar. The variance of disparity thresholds increased markedly with binocular degradation whereas StereoCTs showed no increase in variability (F test, p > 0.05). In one participant with amblyopia, StereoCTs improved from 56% to 49% and disparity thresholds improved from 90 to 45 arc sec with optimum contrast balancing.\n\nConclusion(s):\nStereoCT for disparity defined form detection is a stereopsis measure that is complementary to conventional disparity thresholds. Better sensitivity and lower inter-individual variability to interocular differences may enable a more robust clinical measurement of global stereopsis than current tests allow.","title":"Stereocoherence Thresholds; A Novel Measure of Global Stereopsis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175243\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Daphne McCulloch, Benjamin Thompson.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry University of Waterloo, School of Optometry University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Participants fixated a 20/30 visual acuity Snellen E during 3 cycles of binocular vision, left eye occlusion, binocular vision and right eye occlusion. Each state lasted 5 seconds. The eyes were occluded by means of two pairs of motorized crossed polarizers which blocked visible light, but passed IR, allowing to register movements of the occluded eye. The phoria was computed with two different methods. First, it was computed as the deviation of the occluded eye from its previous binocular position. Second, it was computed as the deviation of the occluded and fixating eyes from their previous binocular positions. The final value of phoria was obtained as the median of the 6 occlusions. Two sessions separated by a 15 min break were recorded for every participant.\n\nResults:\n17 young subjects participated in the study (3 esophoric 14 exophoric). The mean accuracy ± SD of the eye-tracker was 0.31° ± 0.08°. The phoria computed as one eye’s displacement was greater than computed as between eyes deviations in all subjects (p = 0.001). The mean difference ± SD was 0.41 ± 0.41 PD (prism diopter) (range from 0 to 1.34 PD). The coefficient of repeatability of the phoria measurement was 1.63 PD.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe phoria computed as one eye’s deviation is greater than when the relative deviation of both eyes is considered. Under dissociated conditions the fixating eye might move according to Hering’s law, which leads to an overestimation of phoria when deviations of one single eye are measured. Besides the possibility of computing new metrics, the use of eye-trackers during the cover test allows to obtain a more precise measure of phoria than with the typical methods used in clinics.","title":"New Insights into Phoria Measurement using an Eye-Tracker","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175244\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carles Otero, Fernando Díaz-Doutón, Josselin Gautier, Jaume Pujol\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Davalor Research Center.

However, there is little information as to how much computer time causes changes to these systems. With more students using laptops for studying, we looked at the bv and ac of professional students before and after 30 minutes of continuous work on a laptop to determine the effects on the these systems. We also investigated differences between subjects that report symptoms with continuous studying versus those that report no symptoms.\n\nMethods:\nTwenty subjects participated in this study, all with 20/20 or better VA OU, good ocular health, and no previous diagnosis of ac problems, specified systemic conditions, or history of ocular surgery. Participants completed the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey to determine symptoms with near work. Corrected VAs, stereo acuity, cover test, NPC, phorias, vergences, NRA/PRA, accommodative amplitudes and facility, and binocular measurement of ac via the Plus Optix Power Ref were performed. After this testing, subjects spent 30 minutes studying on a laptop. Immediately following, the same tests were repeated. The subjects were placed in 2 groups: symptomatic and asymptomatic. Comparisons were made between the 2 groups via paired t-test.\n\nResults:\nEight of the 20 subjects reported being symptomatic via survey. There were statistically significant changes in NRA values in the symptomatic group (p=0.049), and in the BO break values of the asymptomatic group (p=0.021).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThere were no differences in ac and bv after 30 minutes of continuous studying. Symptomatic subjects had changes in NRA and BO break values. Asymptomatic subjects had no significant changes. More research is needed with larger sample sizes to determine if a specific amount of time on a computer contributes to changes in the bv and ac systems.","title":"The Effects of Computer Use on the Binocular Vision and Accommodative Systems in Professional Students","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175245\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lauren Deveraux, Stacy Perreault\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Arizona College of Optometry, Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Prevalence is more common in females to males 3:1. Incidence is 3.5/100,000 in women 15 to 44 years and increases 19.3/100,000 in women who weigh 20% of more than their ideal body weight.\n\nCase History:\nA 25 year old Jamaican female presented for evaluation of headaches and decreased vision. She experiences transient loss of vision for about 3-5 seconds that happens twice a week that was accompanied by intermittent diplopia at distance and near and pain on eye movements. She was diagnosed with IIH 1 month ago and currently taking Diamox 250 mg bid. Entering acuity was 20/200 OD, 10/400 OS and 20/100 OU with correction at distance. Cover Test showed an 18 IAET at distance and 20 IAET at near both high frequency. Retinoscopy showed -7.25-0.25x090 OD, -7.25-0.75x100 OS resulting in 20/30 acuities in each eye. Damp Retinoscopy showed -4.25-0.50x090 OD, -4.00-0.75x110 OS resulting in 20/20 vision. Cover test was reassessed showed 12 EP in five gazes of field at distance. Posterior segment exam and OCT showed optic nerve elevation in inferior and temporal quadrants OD, OS. CVF showed constricted field, however HVF was normal OD, OS. The patient was referred to neuro-ophthalmology consultation where the dosage of Diamox was increased to 250 mg qid. Once intracranial pressure had stabilized patient presented to clinic for follow up with improved accommodative and convergence strain.\n\nDiscussion\n: Patients with IIH present with headaches and 70% report transient visual obscurations. Diplopia is reported in occurring in about 30-65% of these patients. An accommodative spasm is frequently attributed to a non-organic etiology however, occasionally, organic disorders are associated. This case describes accommodative spasm, with new onset esotropia as a presenting symptom in a patient with IIH that was alleviated after intracranial pressure was reduced.","title":"Accommodative Spasm and New Onset Esotropia Secondary to Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175246\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Katherine Green, Jacqueline Rodena\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

With this low level it can cause typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. A heightened sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one symptom. The sympathetic receptors in the eye include beta receptors on the ciliary body, which produce poor accommodation when active. Blocking these beta receptors with a beta-blocker (BB) can sometimes assist with accommodative insufficiency (AI).\n\nCase Report:\nMP is a 42-year-old African American female who was treated 5 years earlier for thyroid cancer and has had diplopia, dizziness and near blur ever since.  A diagnosis of convergence insufficiency (CI), AI, and hyperphoria led to an initial treatment of vision therapy (VT) and prism glasses. She had a near point convergence of 6 cm with fatigue on repeat, could not clear better than -1.50D OD and -2.00D OS on flippers monocularly, and the monocular accommodative amplitudes were atypically asymmetric with fatigue. A same day blind monocular in-office trial OS of 0.5% timolol gel-forming solution proved better accommodation compared to 30 minutes earlier. After using the drop qam OU, the accommodative amplitudes continued to be asymmetric 1 week later. Monocular treatment was needed OD in order to better balance the accommodative amplitudes. Following treatment, a reduction in symptoms was noted, as well as a  “more balanced” feeling overall. VT continued to assist her CI.\n\nDiscussion:\nTreatment with VT and prism reading glasses was going well, but when accommodation was not improving, research into the patient’s systemic diseases and medication showed a common starting point to her symptoms. Further literature research was the missing piece that showed the significant improvement a BB can have on accommodation.\n\nConclusion(s):\nA BB ophthalmic solution may be the missing treatment in a patient with AI and history of thyroid cancer with a presumed SNS excitability.","title":"Monocular Timolol Ophthalmic Solution is the Missing Treatment in a Patient with Accommodative Insufficiency and History of Thyroid Cancer:  A Case Report","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175247\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Margaret Baumgartner, Bridget Veglia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Baltimore VAMC, Ralph H.

Examination revealed a comitant 20Δ constant left esotropia at distance and a 14-16Δ constant left esotropia at near. A strabismus evaluation showed normal correspondence but poor sensory fusion. The patient had a left afferent pupillary defect and visual field testing showed a left homonymous hemianopsia.\n\nFollowing his initial evaluation, the patient was given fusion prism and completed 15 sessions of office-based vision therapy to improve his sensory fusion and divergence ranges. He then had strabismus surgery to reduce the size of his esotropia and additional vision therapy following surgery.\n\nAfter treatment with vision therapy, the patient noted his diplopia had resolved but he continued to have difficulty walking without bumping into things on his left. He had a low vision evaluation and was given Fresnel prism to aid in mobility with his visual field loss. The patient then had 2 sessions of low vision rehabilitation training where he was taught to use his Fresnel prism and also trained with a mobility cane for independent travel.

These tend to be noncancerous with a 10-year survival rate of 78% (20 to 44 years) and 37% for those 75 and older. Even if the surgery is successful, numerous post-surgical adverse side effects can be particularly challenging and will significantly detract from the patient’s quality of life. This case report demonstrates the need for multiple interventions including vision therapy to address the many issues of patients with brain injury.\n\nCase Report:\nA 63 Y/O WF first presented in 2012 with numerous functional limitations due to the removal of a pituitary tumor which resulted in a CNlll nerve palsy, optic atrophy, left hemianopsia, diplopia, dry eye and visual impairment, as well as ptosis, a fixed/dilated right pupil, and photophobia. Her medical history included stroke, trauma from a car accident, ADHD, induced diabetes, depression, headache and various allergies. FA is taking numerous medications including but not limited to Adderall, Crestor, Boniva, and Synthroid. After prioritizing her goals, interventions that included expertise in vision rehabilitation, anterior seg disorder management and vision therapy were utilized to improve or eliminate her many symptoms.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThose with brain injury have numerous oculo-visual anomalies that optometrists need to address. It is important to have patients prioritize their outcomes so that improved function relates to these desired outcomes. For example, vision therapy was specifically designed for FA to improve her oculomotor and fusional skills so that she could sew her daughter’s wedding dress, eliminate/reduce diplopia and enhance mobility. FA continues to be monitored closely with various interventions utilized as needed.","title":"Vision Therapy Intervention Post Brain Surgery","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175241\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Dennis Ireland\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, the relationship between eye and foot dominance is largely unexplored. This relationship may be useful to understand the way soccer, basketball, ice and field hockey players engage their dominant eye, hand and foot. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between eye, hand and foot dominance.\n\nMethods:\nThirty-two visually-normal (OU: 20/20), healthy subjects (mean age 25.9 + 3.14) participated in the study. The Miles test was performed to determine ocular dominance. Pick an object test was used to determine hand dominance and the ball kicking test was used to determine foot dominance.\n\nResults:\nFifty-nine percent were right eye (OD) dominant and 41% were left eye (OS) dominant. Eighty eight percent were right hand (RH) and 12% left hand (LH) dominant. Eighty-four were right foot (RF) and 16% were left foot (LF) dominant. The agreement between eye & hand dominance was 59% (κ= 0.05, 95% CI -0.214 to 0.324), eye & foot dominance was 69% (κ= 0.28, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.577) and hand & foot dominance was 84% (κ= 0.35, 95% CI -0. 09 to 0.80).

The mechanisms with which CHR-RPE can cause central vision loss include: dense epiretinal membrane, subretinal fluid, and development of choroidal neovascular membranes. The monocular central vision loss associated with CHR-RPE can sometimes contribute to development of a sensory strabismus.\n\nCase report:\nA 13-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of her right eye turning out and intermittent diplopia. Her personal ocular history is significant for a CHR-RPE OD, history of pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peel OD, and a strabismus surgery OD. Her personal medical history was remarkable for attention deficit disorder. Her best correctable vision OD is 20/30 linear optotype, 20/25 single optotype, and OS is 20/15. Contrast sensitivity is slightly reduced in the right eye at 0.52% Michelson, and normal in the left eye. Other visual functions are normal. Her versions demonstrated a mild abduction restriction OD, but full versions OS. Cover test revealed a 30pd right exotropia (XT) with a 4pd right hypo component at distance, and a 25pd right XT with a similar vertical component at near. She had no detectable fusion or stereopsis with free space measurements, however she demonstrated sufficient sensory and motor fusion at her subjective angle measured in the Major Amblyoscope with normal correspondence.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe cause of the XT in this case is most likely sensory in nature. We will further discuss the current theories regarding the causes of sensory strabismus. Additional etiologies include intermittent XT, congenital XT, and paralytic XT. Because this patient demonstrated potential for sensory and motor fusion, we prescribed her prism correction. We also recommended a trial period of vision therapy to expand her motor fusion ranges.","title":"An Unusual Case of Sensory Strabismus","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175233\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Yu-Tai Wu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UC Berkeley School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Symptom-level may be assessed with a variety of self-report written questionnaires including the CISS (a disease-specific tool for convergence insufficiency), the VQS (a quality of life [QOL] tool for binocular vision skills), the COVD-QOL (a QOL tool for visual efficiency and VIP skills), and a novel tool the Visual Information Processing Questionniare (VIPQ) which measures the underlying constructs of VIP function.\n\nWhat is not known is the sensitivity of the VIPQ compared to the CISS, VQS and COVD-QOL tools in the diagnosis of LRVP patients and how the various questionnaires track symptom level(s) as patients complete vision therapy programs.

The hypothesis being that the medication can be a possible confounder in the connection between ADHD and convergence insufficency.\n\nThere is a link between convergence insufficiency and ADHD as 3X as many children with ADHD has this visual problem. Children lacking the abiliy to converge will often compensate by accommodating more when facing a near task. It is unlikely that this is a strategy that will work while being medically treated for ADHD. Centralstimulating medication like Ritalin is the first choice in Denmark when treating ADHD. When the sympathetic nervesystem in the eye is stimmulated it will effect the nearreflex and thereby decreases the eyes ability to focus on a near object.\n\nMethods:\n20 children between the ages of 9-15 were recruited through the Youth Phyciatric Ambulatoriums in the Greater Copenhagen area. Each child underwent 2 visual tests, the first in the morning  before taking their medication and the second while under the influence of their habitual medication. In addition a danish translation of CISS (Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey) was used to asess the typical symptoms of convergence insufficiancy.\n\nResults:\nThe study found a significant change in the monocular accomodation, but not directly in the convergence tests or the binocular accommodation tests. This change was unrelated to whether the testsubject had high or low CISS-scores.\n\nConclusion:\nThe use of centralstimmulant medication taken for ADHD affects the visual function. Even though the drugs do not seem to directly affect the convergence function, it is probable that it indirectly can contribute to the higher prevalence of convergence insufficiency in children with ADHD by decreasing the ability to accommodate and thereby reduce the accommodative convergence.","title":"Convergence Insufficiency and ADHD – Can the Connection be Due to Medication?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175236\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Clinicians often use the Miles test to determine ocular dominance. In this test, the subjects are instructed to extend both arms, bring both hands together to create a small opening to view a distant object.

Amplitude-Scaled Binocular Accommodative Facility (AS-BAF) (Wick et al, 2002), modifies the standard BAF of +2.00 D / -2.00D lens flippers at a 40 cm test distance, to produce an equivalent stimulus for each patient based on individual binocular accommodative amplitude. That is, the higher the amplitude the closer the test distance and the stronger the lens magnitudes used.\n\nWhat is not known is the AS-BAF response compared to the standard BAF response in a population of LRVP patients. Comparison of responses as the LRVP patient progresses through vision therapy may identify when to start and stop accommodative facility training and improve treatment.\n\nMethods:\nIn a private practice in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, 30 consecutive school-aged children (60% male) with an average age of 11 +/- 4 yrs (range: 6.5 to 23 yrs) who were screened for LRVP, completed an initial assessment, and completed their vision therapy. The initial assessment included selected symptom-questionnaires, visual efficiency, VIP and AS-BAF testing along with a re-test of the AS-BAF response. The initial assessment test-battery was repeated at the middle and final evaluations of vision therapy.\n\nResults:\nAt the initial and final assessment, the group-mean response for AS-BAF was 6.3 cpm +/-5.5 & 11.7 cpm +/-5.7, and for BAF was 4.7 cpm +/-5.3 & 13.9 cpm +/-5.1. Paired t-tests for the differences between the initial assessment and final evaluation group-mean responses were highly significant for both AS-BAF (t = 3.80, p\n\nThe sensitivity (Sn) decreased with vision therapy over time for both AS-BAF (Sn1 = 0.77, Sn2 = 0.47, Sn3 = 0.37, cut-off =< 10 cpm) and BAF (Sn1 = 0.53, Sn2 = 0.13, Sn3 = 0.03, cut-off =< 2.5 cpm), and similar if BAF’s cut-off increased from 2.5 to 10 cpm (Sn1 = 0.83, Sn2 = 0.30, Sn3 = 0.30).\n\nTest-retest responses for AS-BAF showed no significant difference (p > 0.3), although slightly faster (~1.8 cpm); the test-retest correlation (r) was high (>0.88) at the initial and final assessment and good (0.63) at the middle evaluation.\n\nConclusion(s):\nFor AS-BAF and BAF tests, the bulk of the reduction in sensitivity (improving) occurred after the first 6-week block of vision therapy suggesting that binocular accommodative therapy should be multi-tasked early in the vision therapy cycle.\n\nThe AS-BAF test-retest difference was too small to be clinically relevant suggesting low compensation or reliance on a predictor operator.\n\nThese results are important as they suggest either the AS-BAF and/or BAF test detects a dysfunction in a population of LRVP patients; however, AS-BAF shows a higher sensitivity at diagnosis and should be used routinely in children screened for LRVP.","title":"Amplitude-Scaled Binocular Accommodative Facility (AS-BAF) Responses in a Population of Patients Screened for Learning-Related Vision Problems (LRVP)","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175239\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ronald Gall\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Private Practice\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Monocular accommodative responses of both eyes were measured using modified Nott retinoscopy at target distances of 50cm, 33cm and 25cm. Three sets of measurements with 15-minute intervals between them were taken in a visit and repeated within 1 week. Within- and between-visit repeatability was assessed by analyzing the responses at all distances and the slopes of the accommodative stimulus-response function (ASRF).\n\nResults:\nIn a linear mixed model, ASRF slopes were 0.72 and 0.71 for better and worse eyes of children with typical vision, and 0.67 and 0.39 for dominant and amblyopic eyes of amblyopes. An average improvement in accommodative response of 0.1 to 0.2D was found at all distances within each visit for both typical eyes and the dominant eyes of amblyopes (all p < 0.0001), but not for the amblyopic eyes (p=0.423).

This apparent deficit was stable within and between visits and may need to be considered when prescribing forms of therapy involving monocular viewing.","title":"Repeatability of Accommodation in Children with Amblyopia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175240\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        So.

The expectations for the amount of time spent reading intensifies as we progress throughout school. We seek a better understanding of the potential variations in accommodation during sustained visual tasks. We evaluate if the lag of accommodation changes following extended periods of reading.\n\nMethods:\nTen subjects, Illinois College of Optometry students, aged 22-26 with acuities of 20/20 were tested. Near testing and lag of accommodation (measured using the Grand Seiko WAM 5500 Optometer) were obtained before participants read a novel on an iPad mini for thirty minutes. Once this was completed, near testing, accommodative testing, and a post study questionnaire were repeated. Reading speed was calculated at ten minute intervals.\n\nResults:\nThere was no statistical difference in lag of accommodation before and after reading. Secondary outcomes including near point of convergence, amplitudes of accommodation and negative fusional vergence also did not change significantly. Positive fusional vergence recovery at near was statistically significantly lower in the post test group (p<0.05).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis pilot study indicates that after thirty minutes of reading, the lag of accommodation remains stable. A notable change after extended reading is a deterioration in convergence recovery at near.

Primary outcome was a group comparison of success rates based on strict or monofixation criterion in randomized spectacles at 2 months. Strict criterion defined success as no manifest esotropia at distance and near while monofixation criterion defined success as any manifest esotropia of ≤ 8¿ measured at distance and near.\n\nResults:\n39 participants (21 in full plus and 18 in partial plus) completed the primary outcome examination.  Mean age (3.3 years in full plus and 3.1 years in partial plus) and mean refractive error in the most hyperopic eye (4.8D in full plus and 4.5D in partial plus) were not statistically different between the two groups. When strict criterion was used, the success rate was 52% (11  of 21)in the full plus group  and 44% (8  of 18) in the partial plus group (p=0.751).  When monofixation success criterion was used, success rate was 57% (12  of 21) in the full plus group and 61% (11  of 18) in the partial plus group (p=1.00).\n\nConclusions:\nChildren with new onset esotropia treated with partial plus had fairly similar success rates compared with full plus. Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to support one treatment method over the other for improved alignment in children with new onset esotropia. Additional studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up are warranted to confirm the effectiveness of partial plus for new onset esotropia in children.","title":"Full Hyperopic Correction vs Partial Hyperopic Correction for Acquired Childhood Esotropia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175223\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Angela Chen, Sergul Erzurum, Benjamin Ticho\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern California College of Optometry, North East Ohio Medical University, Eye Specialists Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Symptoms of CI such as double vision and eyestrain may lead to poor concentration and a short attention span.\n\nCase Report:\nA case study is presented to explore the effects of 12 weeks of vision therapy on symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity in a child diagnosed with CI through Pacific University's Eye Clinic and a reported diagnosis of ADHD from their pediatrician. The subject does not present with a typical pattern of CI, as their ability to release convergence is deficient. The subject's grade school teacher filled out the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) and the ADHD Rating Scale adopted from The Foundation for Medical Practice Education before and again after 12 weeks of vision therapy. Responses were then compared. The total symptom score decreased on the CISS after 12 weeks of vision therapy. The total symptom score also decreased on the ADHD Rating Scale comprising of a decrease of the total ADHD inattention sub-score but a slight increased of the hyperactivity sub-score. Haynes normative analysis was also conducted to evaluate the success of VT throughout the 12 weeks of sessions. Index scores improved from 26.67 at baseline to 36.67.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe results from this case study suggest that vision therapy is useful in treating symptoms of inattention. This case study also presents a starting point for a future full-scale study to determine reliability of results and any statistical significance between survey scores.","title":"ADHD Rating Scale and CISS Score in Children with CI and ADHD Before and After 12 Weeks of Vision Therapy:  A Case Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175225\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Latencies of vertical saccades in aged vs younger subjects, however, are longer for most test conditions. Few studies have examined whether vertical saccades are affected by mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or neurodegenerative disease. Whether mTBI or neurodegeneration can be detected early via subjective assessment of vertical saccades is unknown.\n\nMethods:\nSubjects were 31 adults, aged 35-68 years, with best-corrected near visual acuity of 20/30 or better and no neurodegenerative disease, dyslexia, or recent concussion. Subjects were timed while orally naming numbers (30arcmin size at 40cm) in order of appearance on a high contrast card held at the 40cm near reading distance. It required small upward vertical saccades of varied amplitudes (2.2 to 8deg at 40cm) to successive targets and large return downward sweep saccade (26.6deg at 40cm) to the next column. Each subject was tested twice on a set of 3 cards, with total completion time and errors recorded for each set.\n\nResults:\nTwo-tailed student’s t test on group data showed a significant difference in mean completion time between sets (58.2 +/-12.1 vs 56.7 +/-12.3sec; p=.0006). One-way ANOVA across 5 age subgroups showed no significant difference in mean completion time for either set. No subject had more than 2 errors per set.\n\nConclusion(s):\nAssessment of vertical saccades with number naming showed slight improvement with practice in this group of adults, but completion time was not dependent on age. Additional tests of repeatability in normal subjects and investigations in neuro-pathology are indicated.","title":"Vertical Saccades in a Normal Adult Population:  Subjective Assessment with Number Naming – A Pilot Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175226\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lindsey Brise, Kamil Hill, Jennifer Stewart, Patricia Cisarik\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry, Southern College of Optometry, Southern College of Optometry, Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Newer digital phoropters contain rotary prisms which progress in small step increments of variable magnitude. The purpose of this study was to compare near vergences measured with an automated phoropter to those measured with PB.\n\nMethods:\nTwenty-seven adult subjects with normal binocular vision were recruited. The Reichert VRx Digital Phoroptor® with rotary prism was used to measure vergences with an increment of 1 prism diopter (PD) per eye, or 2 PD total (2PD auto). The test sequence between PB and 2PD auto was randomized. Paired t-test (or Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test), Bland-Altman and Pearson correlation analyses were performed to compare BI and BO break and recovery values between PB and 2PD auto. Agreement was assessed by determining the 95% limits of agreement (LoA): + 1.96 SD of the mean difference between the two tests.\n\nResults:\nMean BI differences between PB and 2PD auto (+ SD) were 7.4 (+ 3.9) PD for break (P < 0.001) and 4.4 (+ 5.5) PD for recovery (P < 0.001). Mean BO differences between the tests (+ SD) were 0.1 (+ 7.7) PD for break (P = 0.84) and 3.4 (+ 9.8) PD for recovery (P = 0.08). BI break and recovery were strongly correlated between the two tests (r = 0.73, P < 0.001 and r = 0.63, P < 0.001, respectively). BO break and recovery were moderately correlated (r = 0.51, P = 0.01 and r = 0.48, P = 0.01, respectively). Agreement between the two tests was better for BI than BO with 95% LoA: 7.5 PD for BI break, 10.8 PD for BI recovery, 15.1 PD for BO break and 19.2 PD for BO recovery.\n\nConclusion(s):\nMeasurement of BI break and recovery differs between PB and this digital phoropter. While measurement of BO break and recovery is not different between the two methods, the agreement between the two methods is relatively poor. Clinicians should use caution when comparing vergence ranges measured digitally with published norms for PB vergences.","title":"Comparison of Near Vergences with Traditional Prism Bar and with Rotary Prisms in an Automated Phoropter","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175230\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Taylor Harris, Michael Gorz, Diana Li, Yi Pang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Development is similar for all individuals, passing through several phases from general to more specific. Deficiencies in typical childhood development can relate to deficiencies in vision development. Visual deficiencies among the deaf population have been shown to correlate with specific disease and syndrome presentations, however, functional visual skills tested on a sample population of deaf children are less studied. Our purpose is to explore the possibility that there is a higher prevalence of visual deficiencies within a deaf population than the general population.\n\nMethods\n: A vision screening was held at the Phoenix Day School for the Deaf. 47 deaf students, ages 8-17, participated in the screening. Visual acuity at distance and near, amplitude of accommodation, near point of convergence, cover test at near and NSUCO pursuits and saccades were tested on each student. Sign language interpreters were used to address any communication barriers and helped to provide additional instructions in order to obtain accurate data.\n\nResults\n: 33 of the 47 students performed outside the normal limits of visual function, indicating a visual deficiency, on at least one test performed. The number of students deficient on each test was as follows: visual acuity: 18, cover test: 10, near point of convergence: 5, amplitude of accommodation: 11, NSUCO: 6.\n\nConclusion(s)\n: This was only one population of deaf students, and it is important to recognize the limitation of sample size. The high overall prevalence of visual deficiencies discovered through this screening highlights the importance of yearly eye exams to diagnose and/or rule out visual deficiencies, specifically in a deaf population. Visual deficiencies can affect school performance and quality of life. With early detection, early intervention can be pursued, creating a foundation for learning and further success.","title":"Study and Analysis of Visual Deficiencies within a Population of Deaf School-aged Children","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175231\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Lu, Tania Marcolin, Basim Taliani\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Arizona College of Optometry, Arizona College of Optometry, Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The initial assessment included four self-report written questionnaires (CISS, VQS, COVD-QOL, VIPQ) and selected visual efficiency and VIP tests; this test-battery was repeated at evaluations in the middle and end of vision therapy.\n\nResults:\nThe selected visual efficiency and VIP tests that showed a sensitivity (Sn) higher than 0.70 at the initial assessment were: distance vergence facility (distVF, Sn1 = 0.82, Sn2 = 0.64, Sn3 = 0.23, cut-off =< 12), near vergence facility (nearVF, Sn1= 0.73 Sn2 = 0.45, Sn3 = 0.14, cut-off =< 15,), amplitude-scaled binocular accommodative facility (AS-BAF Sn1 = 0.73 Sn2 = 0.45, Sn3 = 0.32, cut-off =< 10),) and for the questionnaires were: CISS (Sn1 = 0.73, Sn2 = 0.36, Sn3 = 0.32, cut-off => 16), COVD-QOL (Sn1 = 0.73 Sn2 = 0.36, Sn3 = 0.36, cut-off => 20) and VIPQ (Sn1 = 0.82, Sn2 = 0.59, Sn3 = 0.36, cut-off => 11).\n\nThe group-mean response and standard deviation (SD) at the initial assessment (1), middle (2) and final (3) evaluations were:\n\ndistVF1 = 1.9 +/- 4.1, distVF2 = 7.8 +/- 6.2 & distVF3 = 13.4 +/- 6.5;\n\nnearVF1 = 10.5 +/- 6.6, nearVF2 = 14.9 +/- 7.6 & nearVF3 = 18.8 +/- 4.1;\n\nAS-BAF1 = 7.0 +/- 5.6, AS-BAF2 = 11.7 +/- 5.4 & AS-BAF3 = 12.4 +/- 5.4;\n\nCISS1 = 23.2 +/- 13.5, CISS2 = 16.0 +/- 9.3 & CISS3 = 10.3 +/- 8.5;\n\nCOVD-QOL1 = 27.0 +/- 10.0, COVD-QOL2 = 18.1 +/- 9.8 & COVD-QOL3 = 14.6 +/- 9.8.\n\nVIPQ1 = 15.5 +/- 6.4, VIPQ 2 = 11.6 +/-6.5 & VIPQ 3 = 8.8 +/- 6.5.\n\nFor this group of tests and questionnaires the paired t-tests for differences between the initial assessment and final evaluation were highly significant at the 0.001 level: distVF t = 7.07, nearVF t = 5.0,  AS-BAF t = 3.22, CISS t = 3.78,  COVD-QOL t = 4.17 , VIPQ t = 3.47.\n\nConclusion(s):\nGiven a patent who was screened for LRVP with normal phorias at distance and near, a differential diagnosis may be made based primarily on using DistVF, NearVF and AS-BAF testing along with symptom-level gauges like the CISS, COVD-QOL and VIPQ. With vision therapy, symptom-levels improve before clinical findings suggesting treatment to continue until clinical responses are normalized.","title":"The Learning-Related Vision Problem (LRVP) Patient with Normal Phorias at Distance and Near: What Tests Detect a Vision Problem?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175232\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Oakville Centre for Vision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Bruce Wick\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Retired Emeritus UHCO\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The threshold elevation following adaptation is also non-specific to direction if pattern criterion is used. In this study, we tested if the perceived depth in global motion is also directional independent.\n\nMethods:\nTen subjects participated in the study. First, the threshold to detect global motion was measured with random dot kinematogram for 12 directions with the method of constant stimuli. For each direction, the coherence levels were set at 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 64%. In each trial, two intervals were presented, one with a coherent motion and one with only randomly moving dots. The subject’s task was to select the interval containing the coherent motion. The results were fitted in Weibull function to derive threshold and slope. Second, in the depth perception test, the coherence level was set at 50% and dots moving at 24 directions in random order. In each trial, the subject indicated if the surface composed of the coherent moving dots appears in front or behind the surface composed of randomly moving dots. The each direction was tested for 16 times and the percentage of reporting the motion appeared in front was counted. Third, Rayleigh test was used to determine if the distribution of the results was uniform on all directions and directional bias was used to quantify the preference of certain direction.\n\nResults:\nFor depth perception, all subjects showed non-uniform distribution on the tested directions (p < 0.05, Rayleigh test). However, in 9 subjects, the threshold to detect global motion was independent of directions (P > 0.05, Rayleigh test). The directional bias in perceived depth was significantly greater than that in detection threshold (0.363 ± 0.19 vs. 0.08 ± 0.07, p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test).\n\nConclusion(s):\nWhile the detection of global motion is independent of directions, there is anisotropy in perceived depth for global motion.","title":"Anisotropy of Perceived Depth in Global Motion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175195\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Edgar Ekure, Jinghui Wang, Ran Zhuo, Bin Zhang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Therefore, this study hopes to reveal an acuity chart, specifically comparing charts using letters vs numbers, that is repeatable among patients with dementia and Alzheimers’ disease to allow a more accurate assessment of their vision in order to improve their quality of life.\n\nMethods:\n23 English-speaking subjects diagnosed with moderate to advanced levels of dementia were recruited from two local Birmingham nursing homes. Visual acuities were measured in a randomly selected eye and timed from six different charts: Back-illuminated ETDRS chart with letters, Back-illuminated ETDRS chart with numbers, HOTV cards with single, isolated letters, Lea cards with numbers, HOTV cards with single crowded letters, Lea cards with single crowded numbers. Acuities were re-measured and timed using the same patients and same charts at random order, one week later. Non-parametric tests were used to evaluate differences between measured chart acuities. Intraclass correlation coefficients between administrations were calculated using a linear mixed model.\n\nResults:\nThe best acuities were accomplished with single letter (20/25 median) and single number charts(20/25 median). The worst acuity was achieved with both the ETDRS number(20/50) and letter charts(20/50). Difference between ETDRS number and letters acuities were statistically poorer (p < .005) than comparable single letter acuities and between crowded versus uncrowded single letter (p < .05)  Best agreement between first and second acuities on the same chart was with single letter acuity with ICC of .79, followed by ETDRS letter ICC .55 and single number .55.\n\nConclusion(s):\nSingle letter charts provided the best and most repeatable acuity among this group of subjects with dementia. There appears to be no number or letter bias for better acuity among this group. The increase in acuity with increasing chart complexity suggests a crowding effect or global distraction factor with chart type.","title":"A Comparison Between Number and Letter Acuities Among Patients with Dementia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175196\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Mark Swanson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama in BIrmingham School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The emission spectrum of modern displays frequently includes a high percentage of blue light. Being higher in energy, these short wavelengths may contribute to DES. This study examined the effect of a blue-blocking filter on symptoms of DES during a sustained near-vision task.\n\nMethods:\n24 young, visually-normal subjects were required to perform a 30 minute reading task from a tablet computer.   The digital screen was overlaid with either a blue-blocking (BB) or neutral density (ND) control filter to provide equal screen luminance. During each session, the accommodative response, pupil diameter and vertical palpebral aperture dimension (VPAD) were measured at 0, 9, 19 and 29 minutes following the start of the reading task. Immediately following each session, subjects completed a questionnaire to quantify symptoms of DES.\n\nResults:\nThe BB filter blocked 99.9% of the wavelengths between 400 and 500nm. The mean total symptom scores (± 1SEM) for the BB and ND filter conditions were 42.83 (3.58) and 42.61 (3.17), respectively (p = 0.62).  No significant differences in pupil diameter, accommodation or VPAD were observed between the two filter conditions, although the magnitude of the mean accommodative response did increase significantly during the first 9 minutes of the task (p = 0.02).\n\nConclusion(s):\nSymptoms of DES were not improved by the use of a BB filter.

In it where consulted 60 clinical histories of perceptual abilities and primitive reflexes of students in the sixth semester in the optometry bachelor of IPN-CISC UST. The tests were evaluated using the primitive reflex scale and the VMI Beery-Buktenica test. They were supervised by only one neurological specialist. The study included forty-three clinical histories (24 women and 19 men) aged 19-54 years which contained the complete data. Data analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS version 23 program.\n\nResults:\nIn the evaluation of primitive reflexes, it was found that there is a greater persistence of grade 1 in 4 of the 6 primitive reflexes evaluated. The palmar and Spinal Galant reflexes were integrated in 41.9% of the study population. The reflex with the highest level of persistence (4) was Moro in 25.5% of the participants. In the evaluation of the VMI test, it was founded the most frequency perceptual age as 5.6 years. In motor coordination, the equivalent age was 5.4 and 6.4.

Scores on the “Grit Survey” administered to several groups were as powerful at predicting success in their programs as measures believed to reflect natural aptitude, such as the SAT.\n\nThis study explored whether several measures used for optometry school admission and the Grit Survey could predict test average in the Visual Sensation and Perception class (VSP) in 1st year optometry students.\n\nMethods:\nThe Class of 2020 at Southern College of Optometry was administered the Grit Survey early in the spring semester of 2017. Multiple regression analysis was used to model the prediction of the VSP test average (3 multiple choice exams) using the variables of undergraduate GPA, Optometric Admissions Test (OAT) Academic Average and Total Science, and Grit Survey scores.\n\nResults:\nF-test indicates adjusted R squared is significantly different from 0 (p < .0001). Adjusted R square indicates the model explains 31% of the variability in VSP test average. The estimated rate of change of the conditional mean of VSP test average with respect to GPA with other variables fixed is between 4.7 and 12.3 points, and with respect to Total Science OAT score with other variables fixed, between 0.04 and 0.24 points. No statistically significant linear dependence of the mean of VSP test average on Academic Average OAT or Grit Survey score was found.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn this group of 1st year optometry students, undergraduate GPA and Total Science OAT score, but not Academic Average OAT or Grit Survey score, were significant in predicting VSP test average. Failure of Grit Survey score to be significant in VSP test average prediction may be related to magnitude of standard deviation (+/- 0.3) of the group’s Grit Survey scores or to failure of average test score in a single course to represent “success” in an academic program.","title":"Comparison of Grit Survey, OAT, Undergraduate GPA and VSP Test Scores in First Year Optometry Students","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175190\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lindsay Elkins\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The complexity of stimulus presentation and difficulty in data interpretation in light of variations in CFF that occur with different stimulus parameters may have limited the use of CFF as a common clinical measure. Studies are needed to determine stimulus conditions required to quickly collect reliable data that can be meaningfully interpreted for each patient.\n\nWe compared automatic and manual protocols for measuring CFF that vary sweep rate of temporal frequency using the Flicker Fusion System (model 12021A, Lafayette Instruments).\n\nMethods:\nParticipants were 77 healthy adults, aged 18-40 years, with normal vision. Two measures of CFF using 3 different randomly ordered sweep rates were obtained on a randomly selected eye with the ascending auto mode (ASC), descending auto mode (DESC), and subject-controlled analog mode (MAN) for both sweep directions.\n\nResults:\nCorrelated student t test showed 1) no difference in mean CFF for left vs right eye for any sweep rate/stimulus direction, 2) a significant difference in mean CFF between trials for ASC-1 Hz, ASC MAN, DESC MAN. Correlated student t test for combined trials for ASC 2 Hz vs ASC 4 Hz showed no significant difference in mean CFF (p = 0.70). One-way ANOVA for correlated samples for combined trials for DESC 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 4 Hz showed no difference in mean CFF across groups (p = 0.73).\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn this study, across trial repeatability of CFF was obtained for ASC 2Hz and 4 Hz, and for DESC 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 4 Hz. Since no difference in mean was found between 2 Hz and 4 Hz sweep rates for ASC direction or for 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 4 Hz for DESC direction, we recommend using 4 Hz sweep rate in clinical settings for more rapid and repeatable data collection. The effects of sweep rate on CFF measures in disease states remains to be explored.","title":"Effect of Rate of Stimulus Temporal Sweep Change on Measured CFF in Young, Healthy Adults","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175191\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jessica Ward, Nick Sachse\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry, Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This misdiagnosis leads to an incorrect visual prognosis and impedes proper low vision management. ERG findings that have incorrectly identified rod dysfunction or that have found residual cone function in a subset of incomplete Achrom (icAchrom) could be a source of misdiagnosis. Our case series used dark adapted (DA) ERGs and the Robson model\n1\nphotoreceptor parameters to verify rod function and addresses variations of residual cone function in icAchrom.  The case series consists of 4 subjects; 2 of whom were misdiagnosed as infants and 1 was unaware of his diagnosis despite undergoing clinical testing.\n\nCase Report:\nFour subjects ages 9 yrs to 41 yrs with suspected or diagnosed Achrom were seen at the CSE between 2014 and 2017. Case history, visual acuity testing, refraction, ISCEV standard ERG, analysis of photoreceptor function, macular OCT scans, and photography were obtained. Visual acuities ranged from 20/100 to 20/200. All subjects had normal DA ERGs and normal rod function as determined by Robson model parameters. Light-adapted ERG responses ranged from decreased to absent. OCT scans showed foveal hypoplasia in 2 subjects and foveal outer segment loss in 2 subjects. Photography was unremarkable except 1 subject (age 41 yrs) had increased foveal pigment in both eyes.\n\nDiscussion:\nThis case series emphases the variability of residual cone function and OCT findings in patients with Achrom.

In this study, we attempted to translate a general color chart into a color naming test that could separate mild CVD from moderate-severe CVD.\n\nMethods:\nOne-hundred and nine subjects (controls = 79, subjects with CVD = 30) participated in the study. Controls (mean/SD age = 29.6/13.6 yrs.) did not differ from subjects with CVD (mean/SD age = 33.1/13.5 yrs.) in age. All subjects had anomaloscope testing to determine their color vision status. All CVD subjects were given the Farnsworth D15 test to dichotomize severity (> 1 major crossover = moderate-severe). Subjects named the color of all 24 patches on the X-Rite ColorChecker chart using free naming and constrained naming, which used the 11 colors defined by Berlin and Kay (1969). The naming condition with the most patches reaching 100% agreement among controls was identified. ROC analysis (STATA 10) was performed to identify the best criterion to separate subjects with CVD into mild vs. moderate- severe categories as determined by the D15.\n\nResults:\nFor controls, there was significantly higher (p = 0.01) agreement for the free naming vs. the constrained naming condition (7 vs. 15) out of the 24. The free naming data was not further analyzed. Of the 30 CVD, 17 were classified as mild and 13 were classified as moderate/severe by the D15. ROC analysis showed using a failing criterion of more than 1 misses out of 15, overall the test identified 83.3% of subjects correctly with a sensitivity (i.e. moderate-severe CVD) of 92.3% and a specificity (i.e. mild CVD) of 76.5%.\n\nConclusion(s):\nWe successfully translated a widely available color chart to identify severely affected subjects with CVD. The 15 patches on the color chart provide a general and practical color naming test that can be easily administered by a variety of personnel.","title":"Evaluating the Severity of Color Vision Deficiency by Color Naming with a General Color Chart","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175179\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jason Ng\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Marshall B.

Near VA of one eye from each subject was measured at 40 cm with the M&S Technologies tablet computer system (M&S-NVA) and the Precision Vision chart (P-NVA) in a random sequence. Subjects were retested one week (± 3 days) later. Forty-eight subjects (94%) completed the retest. Repeatability was evaluated using the 95% limits of agreement (LoA) between the two visits.\n\nResults:\nThe mean difference between the M&S-NVA and the P-NVA was 0.02 ± 0.10 logMAR (one letter difference) without statistical significance (Wilcoxon signed ranks test). The average difference between the two visits for both M&S-NVA and P-NVA was 0.02 logMAR (one letter) with no statistical significance. The M&S-NVA had good agreement with the P-NVA, with 95% LoA of ± 0.19 logMAR.

Strengths of CIECAM02 include its adaptation model and use of its inverse model to display predicted appearance changes on a monitor.\n\nMethods:\nObservers with normal color vision sequentially viewed each side of a calibrated AdobeRGB LED monitor with their left eye viewing stimuli through a filter and with their right eye viewing the model predictions. The color stimuli were 2° simulations of Macbeth Color Checker patches of white and 8 different hues in a 3x3 display. A blue blocker, two green notch filters, and a red blocker were used as filters. The lab lighting (1 lux) and the two grey backgrounds (9.3 and 35.8 cd·m¯2) approximated relevant conditions, but pushed the model’s surround parameters to “Dark” values. Subjects adjusted the predictions to match the appearance of the filtered stimuli, rank ordered the predictions by accuracy, and rated them on a 6-point Likert scale. Six observers completed all tasks on one background and six on the other.\n\nResults:\nOverall, adjusted matches were brighter than the “Dark” CAM02 predictions; especially for the darker background (Y = 5.3 vs 2.9) and the brighter stimuli (whiteY = 17.2; yellowY = 10.3). Euclidean u’v’ distances from the “Dark” prediction depended on blue cone absorption (larger distances for the orange, yellow, cyan, and blue stimuli). The blue blocker and a green notch filter produced greater u’v’ distances and poorer ratings.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe visualization based on CAM02 produced good predictions for color appearance through two of the color filters, but the exceptions show the importance of short cone absorption in dark conditions with narrow monitor spectra. These data provide an opportunity to adjust the visualization and CAM02 parameters.","title":"CIECAM02 Predictions of Colored Stimuli Viewed through Colored Filters","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175181\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Air Force Research Laboratory\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        James Dykes, Thomas Kuyk, Rachel Singleton, Paul Garcia, Brenda Novar, Barry Goettl, Craig Williamson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Engility, Engility, Engility, Engility, AFRL, AFRL, Dstl\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study examined the repeatability of contrast and chromatic functions of a novel VA system (moV&, V&MP Vision Suite).\n\nMethods:\n42 participants were assigned to 1 of 2 study blocks: Contrast (n=21) or Chromatic (n=21). Each block consisted of 2 visits (min. 2 weeks apart). Contrast blocks included low contrast (LC) static VA (10%, 44%) using Snellen and moV& charts, and LC moV& dynamic VA (10%, 44%). Chromatic blocks included static VA (standard ETDRS chart; moV&: red target/white background, white target/blue background) and dynamic VA (moV&: red/white, white/blue). Static and dynamic VAs were compared between visits using correlation coefficients of concordance (CCC) to determine repeatability. All VAs are in logMAR (mean ± standard deviation).\n\nResults:\nCONTRAST BLOCK: At 10% and 44%, moV& static VAs were significantly better than Snellen (moV&: 10%: -0.01 ± 0.09, 44%; -0.08 ± 0.12; Snellen: 10%: 0.13 ± 0.09, 44%: -0.01 ± 0.09, p < 0.05).

Although FOG is classically considered as a motor disturbance, it is now widely accepted that this disorder is more complicated mechanism that involves inputs from motor and sensory systems. The purpose of this project is to run cross-sectional studies focusing on the clinical visual acuity and stereoacuity in FOG and non-FOG PD patients. In addition, the visual acuities were measured for both photopic and mesopic conditions because previous models suggested that PD may have a larger reduction in acuity at lower light levels.\n\nMethods:\nCorrected VA and Vernier acuity were measured at distance using EDTRS charts, and Freiburg acuity test respectively. These measurements were measured under photopic, and then under mesopic condition (after 5 minutes of dark adaptation). Local and global stereoacuity were measured at near. 15 FOG-PD, 15 non FOG-PD, and 15 aged matched controls were tested.\n\nResults:\nRepeated Measure ANOVA test showed that VA was significantly reduced in FOG group compared with the other two groups. The reduction was larger under mesopic condition. Vernier acuity was significantly worse in FOG group than the other two groups; however, the relative reduction in Vernier acuity under mesopic condition was similar between groups. Results from local and global stereoacuity tests showed that FOG group had significantly worse stereopsis than non-FOG group, and non-FOG group had significantly worse stereopsis than healthy controls.\n\nConclusion(s):\nResults from this study showed that FOG patients have a greater impairment in both 2-D and 3-D visual resolution tasks. Whether these impairments are contributing to the FOG or just associated with more severe PD cases is uncertain. The non-FOG PD patients also showed a loss in stereoacuity which suggests that measuring stereopsis could be used to monitor progression of non-motor symptoms in PD patients.","title":"Visual Resolution and Hyperacuity in Parkinson’s Disease Patients","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175184\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jeffery Hovis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Our purpose was to establish normative values & repeatability of a cone specific distance color vision test which quantifies cone sensitivity & response time.\n\nMethods:\nThe Cone Contrast Test (CCT; Innova Systems, Inc.), which presents letters of decreasing contrast visible only to L, M & S cones with a staircase to determine L, M and S cone thresholds, was conducted at 4m yielding letters 4X smaller than normal: 20/75 and 20/100 letters for L&M and S cones, respectively. CCTs were measured twice on 30 color vision normal subjects (mean age ± SD = 25.7 ± 3.1 years) to determine normative values & repeatability for cone CS & response times. CCT scores were expressed as 0-100 reflecting log changes in cone contrast with ≥75 normal at the standard 1m distance.\n\nResults:\nCCT scores were lower than standard (<75) when tested with smaller letters at 4m. Higher scores were obtained for L vs. M vs. S cone CS (F = 25.0, p < 0.0001; L mean ± SD = 70 ± 10, M = 61 ± 10, S = 53 ± 15). Coefficient of repeatability (95% confidence interval change) was 10 for L & M (2 letters) & 15 for S cone CS (3 letters). Response times were not significantly different for L, M & S cone CS (F = 2.0, p = 0.14; mean = 2.7 sec.) 7 L, M & S cone CS were not significantly related to macular pigment optical density (r 2 < 0.05).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe distance CCT has promise for application in clinical & occupational settings offering a new metric of color vision for small target (higher spatial frequency) color discrimination. CCT scores combined with response times offer exacting metrics applicable to hereditary and acquired color deficiency with minimal effect of macular pigment differences.","title":"Quantification of Color Vision with Small Target Cone Contrast Sensitivity","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175185\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Matheus Ozbek, Eddy Sidra, Jeff Rabin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry, UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry, UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, many clinical tests involve moderate luminosity which are not addressed clearly in the standard. Our group has noted a small but significant increase in the mfERG foveal amplitude (famp) when performed following an ERG in a prior study. Here we seek to determine if the lights from pupil testing will reveal a similar result.\n\nMethods:\n15 subjects who were part of the previous study returned for pupil testing and mfERG. Pupils were tested in dim room illumination using a protocol of directly illuminating each pupil in three successive intervals followed immediately by intermittent illumination during a swinging flashlight exam. The transilluminator was held 4 mm from the pupil.  Pupil size was measured at entry, before, and after the mfERG. Light levels directly from the source and entering the pupil were recorded with a sekonic illuminometer i346. The mfERG (VERIS 6.2) used a 4 minute m-sequence in full room lighting at 100% contrast.  Results were compared to the previously obtained baseline mfERG with paired t-tests.\n\nResults:\nPupil testing prior to mfERG increased famp by an average of 23.6nV (p=0.001); 87% of subjects demonstrated this increase. There was no correlation between the change in famp and the amount of light which entered the eye measured with the illuminometer, the time between the pupil testing and the end of the mfERG (32±8.4 min), or the overall dilated pupil size (8.9mm ± 0.5mm). This is likely because these were all similar between subjects.  There was no difference in foveal implicit times (p =0.85).\n\nConclusion(s):\nWe find that pupil testing before an mfERG may increase famp. Thus it is important to be consistent in pupil testing in clinical patients.  More follow up work is needed to evaluate other parts of the mfERG waveform and rings outside of the fovea to learn more about this effect.","title":"Pupil Examination Directly Before a Multifocal Electroretinogram Increases Foveal Amplitudes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175186\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Brian Colburn, Chris Johnson, Zachary Nelson, Kaila Osmotherly, Wendy Harrison\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Color vision confusion prevents many otherwise qualified individuals from working in professions involving public safety, including pilots, mariners, and drivers. Recently, EnChroma Filters claim to enhance color perception in people with CVD. The aim of this study was to examine EnChroma Cx-14, red and green filters on subjects with RG CVD.\n\nMethods:\nNine males and one female (aged 19 – 52 years) with RG CVD were recruited: six severe deutan, two moderate deutan and two severe protan. Subjective responses of EnChroma were tested using ColorDx on iPad and on computer FM100 Hue tests. Error scores of the ColorDx and FM 100 Hue tests with EnChroma, Red and Green filters were calculated and compared against Placebo (untinted glasses).\n\nResults:\nEnChroma resulted in CVD improvement from severe protan to moderate protan and from severe deutan to moderate deutan using ColorDx in only two subjects. Neither EnChroma nor green filters improved the mean error scores of ColorDx (\np =\n0.79) and\n(p =\n0.80), respectively. However, red filter significantly improved color discrimination from severe deutan to mild deutan in all deutan subjects and from severe protan to mild deutan in one subject (\np\n= 0.006). EnChroma and the other filters had no significant improvement in the error scores of the FM 100 Hue when compared to placebo.\n\nConclusion(s)\n: EnChroma Cx-14 filters are multi-notch filters that modify the wavelength transmission of the observer. To our knowledge this is the first study to measure the effectiveness of EnChroma on the digital version of Ishihara (ColorDx iPad app). Our results showed that the EnChroma filters had no significant effect on any of the CVD subjects, but improved the CVD diagnosis in only two subjects. EnChroma Cx-14 could enhance certain colors. However, using EnChroma for professional purposes is not supported by our results.","title":"Assessment of EnChroma Filters for the Correction of Color Vision Deficiency","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175187\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        James Kundart, Naganathan Muthuramalingam, Saad Aljohani, John Hayes, Karl Citek\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        College of Optometry Pacific University Forest Grove OR, Qassim University, Qassim University, College of Optometry Pacific University Forest Grove OR, College of Optometry Pacific University Forest Grove OR\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The relationship between CFF and luminance levels was examined in younger and older subjects to determine if age-related deficits in CFF are dependent on luminance level of presented stimuli.\n\nMethods:\nThe Lafayette Instruments flicker fusion system was used to test CFF at ten luminance levels , including photopic (44-0.88 candela/meter2), mesopic (0.044-0.0022 cd/m2) and scotopic (0.0022-0.00022 cd/m2) light levels.  A staircase protocol employed increasing and decreasing luminance CFF tests, with average values calculated at each level. Both eyes were included in testing. A 45-minute dark adaptation was performed for the scotopic and lowest two mesopic levels.  Analysis was based on an n=18 divided into 2 age groups; < 70 years (n=9, mean age 42.2) and ≥ 70 years (n=9, mean age 73.2).\n\nResults:\nThe CFF scores for all subjects were directly correlated with the stimulus luminosity. Comparisons of mean CFF for the two age groups exhibited the greatest difference at the brightest photopic luminance levels, but were statistically different at all levels from 44 to 0.044 cd/m2(p values all ≤ 0.00022). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two age groups in the lower mesopic range.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe greatest differences in CFF scores between the younger and older subjects were observed with stimuli in the photopic and upper mesopic ranges. CFF measured with photopic luminance stimuli may be optimal for testing age-related flicker sensitivity changes.","title":"A Comparison of Young Vs.

Such charts can be printed sufficiently inexpensively to allow a subject to hold one at reading distance and mark it to show the position or identity of the low-contrast targets. This one-time use of charts not only provides a permanent record of the subject's visual function but also avoids the contrast calibration errors that can result from handling and environmental degradation. Multiple variants of each chart can easily be produced making it simple to ascertain the variability of the measurement by repeated testing.\n\nMethods:\nSeveral designs of chart where the subject is required to mark the location of simple grey targets that are randomly positioned within defined areas have been trialled with subjects having vision loss attributable to diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration as well as with normally-sighted individuals.\n\nResults:\nAll subjects have found the charts easy to use with minimal instruction. The time required to mark a chart is typically less than 2 minutes. Comparing logCS measured with these charts and the value obtained using a standard Pelli-Robson chart shows a close correspondence in both normally-sighted and visually-impaired subjects. The standard deviation of repeated determinations (8 or more) of logCS in normally-sighted subjects lies between 0.02 and 0.05, rather less than values reported for measurements made using other methods.\n\nConclusion(s):\nInexpensive printed paper charts that are viewed at reading distance and marked by the subject provide a good measure of contrast sensitivity without requiring the direct involvement of an examiner.","title":"A New Approach to Measuring Contrast Sensitivity","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175176\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Shahina Pardhan, Raju Sapkota, Durgasri Jaisankar, Rajiv Raman, Han Cheng, Andrea Griffin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VERU Anglia Ruskin University, VERU Anglia Ruskin University, Sankara Nethralaya, Sankara Nethralaya, University of Houston, University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The Pupil Project works with St. Louis area children to diagnose visual dyslexia and other visual learning disabilities after a full eye exam. A positive correlative relationship between refractive error and visual learning disabilities has been accepted and disseminated has been found in other child populations. The goal of this investigation is to discover whether there is a correlation relationship between refractive error and visual dyslexia and other visual learning disabilities within The Pupil Project population.\n\nMethods:\nIn our population, the most diagnostic tests for the diagnosis visual learning disabilities (as determined by previous research) are: One Minute Reading (OMR), Duration of Fixation (DOF), and Vertical Developmental Eye Movement (DEMV). Data collected on school aged children in the St. Louis area was retrospectively studied to investigate a possible correlation between refractive error and visual dyslexia and other visual learning disabilities. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and histogram analysis was performed on the collected data to find significance and the best distribution of the data.\n\nResults:\nThere was no significant correlation found between refractive error and OMR (p=0.352), DOF (p=0.938), and DEMV (p=0.238) within our population. Additionally, a histogram of refractive error within our population is analogous to the general population’s histogram of refractive error.\n\nConclusion(s):\nFrom this data, refractive error is not a contributing to visual dyslexia and other visual learning disabilities. This data also suggests refractive error is not a risk factor for later development of visual dyslexia or other visual learning disabilities.","title":"Challenging the Current Belief the Role Refractive Error Plays in School Aged Children with Dyslexia and Other Visual Learning Disabilities","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175177\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Erin Brooks, Aaron Franzel, Quinn Gallen, Heather Stearn\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UMSL College of Optometry, UMSL College of Optometry, UMSL College of Optometry, UMSL College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

To verify the colorimetric results, 68 subjects with a red-green color vision defect performed both the Farns D15 and ColorDx D15. The best 2 out of 3 runs were used in the analysis.\n\nResults:\nColorimetric analysis showed that, although the color differences between adjacent caps were similar in both versions, the ColorDx D15 colors were displaced in the yellow-green direction relative to the paper version.  As result of the color shifts, the predicted ColorDx D15 results were that both protanopes and deuteranopes should have 2 fewer crossings than the Farns D15, but the orientation of the crossings for each test should be similar.  The average number of crossings made by protanopes on the Farns D15 and ColorDx D15 were essentially identical at 8.4 and 8.7 respectively.  The average number of crossings for the deuteranopes was 6.75 on the Farns D15 and 5 on the ColorDx D15.  The anomalous trichromats’ results paralleled their respective dichromatic results.  Results from the color defective subjects showed that the AC1 coefficient agreement between the tests in terms of pass/fail was 0.88 (SE 0.05) with 4 deuteranomalous individuals failing the Farns D15 and passing the ColorDxD15.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe colorimetric predictions indicated that the ColorDx D15 could be slightly easier to pass. This prediction was verified for the deutans, but both tests were equally difficult for protans.","title":"Colorimetric Analysis to Evaluate the Farnsworth D15 and ColorDx D15 Color Vision Tests","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175167\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jeffery Hovis, Zach Barnes\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study seeks to determine if there is correlation between high-energy light exposure and decreased color vision in the blue-yellow color spectrum.\n\nMethods\n: 37 subjects were surveyed on electronics use and blue light and ultraviolet (UV) exposure surrogates. Subjects completed the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue (FM100) color test and Oculus HMC anomaloscope. The Total Error score (TE) of the FM100 was compared to the Tritanomaly Quotient (TQ) of the anomaloscope, and both to survey responses. The TE quantifies the number and distance of color gradient arrangement errors and TQ represents wavelength confusion range.\n\nResults\n: 3 subjects were removed from analysis. The TE and the TQ were not correlated (p= 0.57). Age was negatively correlated with TQ (p < 0.01, r= -0.45), but was not correlated with TE (p= 0.96.) The TQ was negatively correlated with latitude lived from the equator, (p < 0.005, r= -0.52) and positively correlated with premature facial hyperpigmentation (p < 0.05, r= 0.38). Sunglasses use was correlated with a greater TE (p < 0.05, r= 0.36), but not with TQ (p= 0.95). Neither test was correlated with: spherical equivalent refractive error, eye color, use of anti-reflective or blue-blocker lens coating, contact lenses, tanning beds, or SPF skin protectant, history of severe sunburns, or heavy use of electronic screens.\n\nConclusion(s)\n: Though both measure color vision, the FM100 and anomaloscope did not correlate for sensitivity in the blue-yellow spectrum. Results of the anomaloscope suggest that those who spend more time at lower latitudes or have premature facial pigmentation have worse color sensitivity. Some results, such as sunglasses use being correlated with greater color confusion scores (TE), and age being negatively correlated with the TQ were unexpected and warrant further study.","title":"Effect of High-Energy, Low-Wavelength Light on Blue/Yellow Color Vision","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175168\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Clarissa Orzell, Amber Delly, Laura Addy\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Arizona College of Optometry, Arizona College of Optometry, Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

In gathering these norms, there was anecdotal evidence that the elderly appeared to tire considerably during testing. The current investigation explored this notion through analysis of the effects of order of plates upon the time taken to trace each plate, number of errors made and mean deviation.\n\nMethods:\nThe L-R EHC Test was administered to 40 participants aged 5 to 26 years and 27 participants aged 50 to 88 years whilst seated at a desk wearing habitual near correction and using a Bluetooth stylus pen. Each participant viewed binocularly while they traced a common first plate as a practice exercise, followed by 19 different shapes presented in random order. The warning sound option was activated to alert when a mistake had been made. Output data which included time taken to complete each trace and total errors and actual deviations was emailed from the device. Data was analysed for the four easiest plates, six moderately complex plates and the three most complex plates with respect to order effects upon time taken, errors made and mean deviation according to age using 10-year age-group brackets.\n\nResults:\nLinear regression analyses indicated that the L-R EHC variables time taken to trace, number of errors and mean deviation did not significantly change with the order in which the shapes were presented regardless of shape difficulty or the age group.\n\nConclusion(s):\nDespite the full version of the L-R EHC Test taking close to 10 minutes on average to complete, no consistent order effects were seen which suggests that regardless of age, changes in vigilance and fatigue were not contributing factors to EHC performance. It follows that a mini-version of the L-R EHC Test can be created using error rates and times taken as already established as a guide to complexity of each tracing task.","title":"Are There Order Effects During Administration of the Digital L-R Eye-Hand Coordination Test?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175170\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry and Vision Science UNSW\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jenny Guo, Rebecca So, Sieu Khuu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of New South Wales, University of New South Wales, University of New South Wales\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This information is used to regulate circadian rhythms, pupil size and sleep/wakefulness. Prior studies have focused on the effect of extended blue light exposures on alertness levels. As we have found that an alternating red/blue flashing light is a potent stimulant for ipRGCs, we investigated whether this stimulus, applied over 2 min, can increase alertness.\n\nMethods:\n8 subjects (age 23-43; 75% female) were recruited to participate in two experimental sessions. Subjects arrived in morning prior to sunrise and baseline reaction time (RT) was measured using a computerized psychomotor vigilance test. The subjects were dark adapted for 45 min and the RT re-measured. Subjects were exposed to a 2 min-long light stimuli (10^13 phots/s/cm^2; continuous blue light in one session and 0.1 Hz alternating red/blue light in the other) and RT again measured immediately after and then after 2 successive 15 min dark adaptations. To assess ipRGC stimulation, pupil size was monitored during the light exposures.\n\nResults:\nReaction time was normalized to that obtained after the 45 min dark adaptation. There was no significant difference between the 5 measured reaction times obtained in the blue-only session (p=0.9, One-way RM ANOVA). For the alternating light session, RT was significantly (p < 0.01) decreased (by 8.0% ± 2.4 SEM) immediately after light exposure and after the first 15 min recovery period (by 5.4% ± 2.5). There was no significant difference in the mean pupil size (p=0.69, paired t-test) recorded during the two light exposure periods.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe research shows that a 2 min-long exposure to a flashing red/blue light stimulus can significantly decrease reaction time. Our results suggest this stimulus may be more effective than blue light for increasing alertness.","title":"Effect of Short-Term Light Exposure on Alertness","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175171\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Philip Yuhas, Andrew Hartwick\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University, The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Our purpose was to evaluate the Diopsys® mfERG recorded with infra-orbital skin electrodes 4 min./eye.\n\nMethods:\nThe mfERG stimulus consisted of 19 hexagons with a central 5 deg. foveal stimulus surrounded by ring 1 (5 deg. inner & 22 deg. outer diameter) and ring 2 (22 deg. inner, 42 deg. outer diameter). The black-white hexagons were reversed in pseudo-random fashion with mfERGs recorded monocularly in four 1-minute epochs to amass average focal responses from each retinal site. 30 visually normal subjects (mean age ± SD = 25.7 ± 3.1 years) were tested without dilation or optical correction at the recommended distance of 36 cm. mfERGs were recorded with Diopsys® infra-orbital skin electrodes with active electrode below the tested eye, reference electrode below the occluded eye and ground electrode on the forehead. Mean and confidence intervals were established for amplitudes and latencies from fovea, 1st & 2nd rings.\n\nResults:\nPositive peak (P1) amplitude decreased significantly with eccentricity (F = 70.7, p2, Ring #1: 19.9 ± 6.2 nV/deg2, Ring #2: 11.7 ± 6.3 nV/deg2.

No LED light source to our knowledge has been evaluated as appropriate for color vision testing, which requires a light with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of approximately 6000K & a CRi >90 (i.e. illuminant C equivalent).\n\nFurther, we present color vision testing results from 6 subjects with CVD using both the Fiilex & Richmond light sources.\n\nMethods:\nThe CCT & CRi of two Fiilex lamps were measured two times each using an i1pro spectrophotometer & the results were averaged. Additionally,\n\n6 subjects with congenital CVD (diagnosed by anomaloscopy) were tested on the HRR & Farnsworth D15 tests using a Richmond Illuminator & a Fiilex lamp on separate days. The order of lights tested was randomized. All tests were performed using an illuminance of ~500 lux.\n\nResults:\nThe average measured CCT value for the Fiilex lamp was 6145K. The average CRi value for the lamp was 92.63. Subjects ranged from mild to strong deuteranomalous & protanomalous types of CVD. D15 results were remarkably repeatable. Three milder subjects passed with 0 major crossovers (MC) using either light source. Additionally, 3 more severe subjects failed under both conditions. Two subjects had an identical number MC’s between sources (8 & 10 respectively). One subject had 9 MC’s using the Richmond Illuminator & 8 using the Fiilex Lamp. HRR results were also similar with all six subjects failing under both lighting conditions. There was some variance among the severity ratings of the defects, but no monotonic trend existed between the two sources.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe Fiilex LED lamp met the Illuminant C equivalent requirement. Color vision tests using the lamp resulted in generally the same outcome as using the Richmond Illuminator. Overall the LED lamp was shown to be an acceptable source for CVD testing & it is very likely that other LED lamps could perform similarly, allowing for greater flexibility in light sources for color vision testing.","title":"Evaluation of an LED Light Source for Color Vision Testing","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175174\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jason Ng\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Marshall B.

The most common primary tumors for males are lung (metastasis early), unknown primary, GI, prostate, renal cell, and skin melanoma.\n\nCase Report:\nA 54-year-old Caucasian male complained of left eye sharp pain (scale 8/10) for 10 days. He has no ocular trauma and generally healthy. He is a past smoker without pulmonary symptoms. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)s were 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. External examination of the eyes revealed a shallow anterior chamber OS. Goldman IOPs were 16 OD and 23 mmHg OS. Fundus examination showed OS serous retinal detachment inferiorly and an elevation infratemporal, choroidals subretinal fluid peripheral and sub-macular. B-scan and macular OCT confirmed these findings. Computed tomography scanning showed right lung upper lobe mass. Fine needle aspiration cytology from the lesion was suggestive of adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe initial assessment of this case is choroidal effusion OS. Differential diagnosis of choroidal effusion includes posterior scleritis, Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome, and Uveal effusion syndrome. This 54 years old man patient has no pulmonary symptoms, nor ocular trauma/ intraocular surgery history. The patient started chemotherapy for lung cancer and possible external beam radiation to the left eye (choroidal lesion is too large for plaque brachytherapy. The patient tolerated this combination remarkably well. A follow-up visit 3 weeks later revealed BCVA 20/HM @1ft OS.\n\nConclusion(s):\nChoroidal effusion/mass often indicates metastasis tumor. But it is rare to be monocular and the first sign of cancer, Laboratory studies and radiology test are often required to find the primary sites of tumor and make a differential diagnosis.

Anterior subcapsular cataract is an uncommon sequelae of this condition. Black mold exposure is a known allergen, though anterior subcapsular cataract in a patient with no previous signs or symptoms of atopy has not been reported.\n\nCase Report:\nWe present a case of a 31 year old African American female who presented to an urban eye clinic with complaints of blurry vision. The patient reported a hypersensitivity reaction at age 28 to black mold precipitating a change in vision. Recent re-exposure to black mold triggered another severe dermatological reaction associated with worsening acuity. Upon examination, the previously noted bilateral anterior subcapsular cataracts had progressed in the right eye to 3+ and the patient was reduced to 20/30. Intraocular pressure was 20 OD and OS. Dilated ocular health examination was unremarkable OU.\n\nConclusion(s):\nAnterior subcapsular cataracts are linked to young patients with atopic dermatitis and are known to follow dermatological signs.  However, in the absence of an extensive atopic history by the age of 28, including the classic triad of atopic disease (asthma, allergy and atopic dermatitis), this sequelae to black mold is unusual.","title":"Anterior Subcapsular Cataract Secondary to Black Mold Exposure","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175164\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Bruce Teitelbaum\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Currently,there are no local studies that have been published in the Philippines that targeted on the deaf population in correlation to the eyes.\n\nMethods:\nThe subjects were 470 students from Philippine School for the Deaf. After a series of approval from institutions and after the researchers underwent a basic sign language training the subjects underwent a comprehensive eye exam comprising: case history, automated refraction, preliminaries, visual acuity taking, ocular health exam, objective and subjective refraction.\n\nResults:\nThe predominant classification of deafness according to cause was congenital (71.70%) while according to level was profound (78%). Half of the population was found to have refractive errors, with astigmatism (23%) being the most predominant. Ocular abnormalities, mostly found at the anterior segment, were present in the (13.83%) right and (12.34%) left eyes.

The area around the disc is affected first, and the degeneration slowly radiates and enlarges to include the macula and periphery.\n\nCase Report:\nThis middle aged African-American female presented with a known diagnosis of Helicoid Peripapillary Chorioretinal Degeneration, which was diagnosed through early genetic testing.  She has a history of intermittent right esotropia for which she received strabismus surgery in childhood. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/30- OD, 20/20 OS.\n\nFundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging of the lesions highlights the clearly defined propeller-like hypoflurescent areas with narrow band hyperfluorescence of the leading edges.  Optical coherence tomography demonstrates macular thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer, especially where the lesion is encroaching on the macula in the left eye.  Humphrey visual field testing revealed absolute scotomas corresponding to the chorioretinal lesions seen in both eyes.\n\nDiscussion:\nHelicoid peripapillary chorioretinal degeneration, also known as Sveinsson’s chorioretinal atrophy (SCRA), is more often seen in Icelandic patients, but cases have also been reported in Canada, Switzerland and in Bosnian Serbs.  This case is unusual in that it is present in this African-American female, and is not present in her parents or children.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe slow, bilateral encroachment into the macular area of HPCD may be better monitored utilizing FAF in conjunction with visual field analysis.  Careful retinal follow up is indicated due to the proximity of the lesion to the macula in the left eye.  Further genetic testing of this patient and her family can aid in determining if this is a variant of HPCD.","title":"Optical Coherence Tomography and Fundus Autofluorescence Imaging of Helicoid Peripapillary Chorioretinal Degeneration in an African-American Female","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175155\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kim Poirier\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Duration of use and daily dose are risk factors for the development of retinal toxicity, which is irreversible and may be progressive following cessation of the medication. The overall risk of retinal toxicity is less than 1% at 5 years but can be as high as 20% at 20 years. Automated visual field testing and SD-optical coherence tomography (OCT) are the recommended screening tests for retinal toxicity given they are sensitive to and highly specific for early changes. Once toxicity is identified, it is imperative for the optometrist to communicate that to the treating physician so that decision to cease therapy with CQ or HCQ and try alternative medications can occur.\n\nCase Report:\nA 59-year-old CF with SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, and thyroid disease presented for specialty contact lens fitting to treat her severe chronic dry eye symptoms. Weighing 105 lbs., she had been taking Plaquenil 300 mg qd for 4 years. Baseline 10-2 automated perimetry revealed dense annular scotoma OU and macular OCT indicated severe thinning OU. Thirteen months after HCQ cessation, her vision had declined, and the annular scotoma and macular thinning had progressed.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe recommendations for screening for CQ and HCQ toxicity were updated in 2016. HCQ retinal toxicity is considered rare and may lead to a lack of review of pertinent guidelines. While uncommon, the annular scotoma associated with retinal toxicity is visually devastating and may progress following cessation of CQ or HCQ.

Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) improve results which choroidal characteristics and analysis are required. Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked chorioretinal dystrophythat affects about 1:50,000 to 1:100,000 males worldwide, and occurs in about 4% of the blind population, being the second leading cause of hereditary and progressive night blindness after retinitis pigmentosa. The dystrophy is characterized by progressive degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium(RPE), photoreceptors, and choroid. Females are carriers and usually asymptomatic, but at fundus examination, patchy areas of chorioretinal degeneration, due to random X-inactivation (lyonization), can be observed. A comparative study of choroidal thickness (CT) measurement was carried out by using both, line and volume scans with the swept source Triton (Topcon Inc) in 7 women (20.8 ±11.3 years) carriers of choroidoremia diagnosed by genetic analysis. Our data indicate a significant decrease in the choroidal thickness of the macular nasal sector in both eyes in 6 of the 7 patients studied, using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for correlated samples (p <0.05), despite good best corrected visual acuity. Both measurement resources used have allowed a satisfactory estimate of the thickness decrease measured and added to the characteristic ocular fundus findings described for carriers of CHM may contributes to improve clinical diagnosis.

Truvada is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that boosts the immune system, specifically enhancing the CD4 cell count while blocking the pathway for early HIV infection. Discontinuation can therefore put a patient at risk of a systemic inflammatory response, according to the Truvada label, due to sudden depletion of upregulated adaptive immunity. This case report demonstrates ocular inflammation after discontinuation which has not been previously reported in the literature.\n\nCase Report:\nA 33 year old African American male presented to the urgent care clinic with redness, photophobia, and mild discomfort OU. His medical history was remarkable for a discontinuation of prophylactic Truvada. The medication was discontinued 5 days prior after ending a relationship with his HIV positive partner. Entering VAs were 20/20 OD, OS. Anterior segment revealed 2+ conjunctival injection with 1+ cells OD and 1+ conjunctival injection with +0.50 cells OS. IOP was 18mmHg OD, 16mmHg OS. Dilated fundus exam was unremarkable and revealed no signs of posterior inflammation. He was started on prednisolone acetate qid OU and cyclopentolate tid OU. Blood work was negative for syphilis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and HLA-B27 spondylarthropathies. He was also cleared by infectious disease for Lyme disease.\n\nConclusion(s):\nTruvada’s PrEP has shown a 44% decrease in the risk of acquiring the HIV-1 infection but unregulated stopping and starting of HIV medications can leave residual levels of inflammation within the body. Specifically, missing doses of Truvada can cause systemic inflammation in addition to immediate risk of infection. This is a unique case of ocular inflammation after discontinuation of Truvada.","title":"Anterior Uveitis Secondary to Discontinuation of Truvada","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175160\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Heather McLeod\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

These malignant myeloma cells spread through the body to form multiple small lesions, such as plasmacytomas, which occur in soft tissue and bone. The lesions can appear in almost every ocular structure, but most frequently occur in the orbit. The most common ocular presenting signs are proptosis, vision loss, diplopia and edema. We present two cases of orbital infiltration of plasmacytoma: one causing vision loss and another causing diplopia and pain.\n\nCase Report:\nCase 1: An 80-year-old woman presents with 5 months of progressive vision loss OD. She has a history of multiple myeloma which has been in remission for 5 years. Neuro-imaging reveals a plasmacytoma originating from the right superior orbital rim, encompassing the right optic nerve and extending into the sphenoid and cavernous sinuses. Case 2: A 74-year-old woman presents with left eye pain which has been progressively worsening over the past 2 months and a recent onset of diplopia. She was diagnosed with multiple myeloma 1.5 years ago and is currently in treatment. Neuro-imaging reveals a plasmacytoma of the left orbit encompassing the inferior rectus, medial rectus and superior oblique muscles.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe incidence of cancer is on the rise. Eye care providers should be aware of the variety of ocular manifestations in any patient with a prior diagnosis of cancer; particularly multiple myeloma. Ocular plasmacytomas can be the sign of recurrent disease or the initial manifestation of undiagnosed systemic disease.

While his systemic history was negative for treated illness he did remark recently he felt fatigue with difficulty breathing. Examination uncovered diffuse intraretinal hemorrhage with areas of vitreous hemorrhage OD, Roth spots were observed OU and peripheral retinal neovascularization was present OU. The patient was urgently referred to the vitreoretinal specialist for surgical treatment. A laboratory workup was ordered which included a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), liver function studies (LFS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR Westergren), lipid panel, carotid Duplex testing, electrocardiogram (ECG), fasting blood sugar (FBS) and chest x-ray (CXR) to rule out the presence of diabetes, carotid artery disease, coagulopathy, hyperviscosity syndromes, systemic and retinal vascular disease, dyslipidemia, giant cell arteritis, systemic infection, tuberculosis and inflammatory disease.

Serous retinopathy is an uncommon adverse reaction of cobmetinib use and may indicate need to terminate treatment. Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) permits increased visualization of ocular structures allowing for careful monitoring in patients with retinopathy.\n\nCase Report:\nA 71 year-old male presented to the optometry service complaining of photopsia. Medical history was significant for metastatic melanoma for which cobimetinib/vemurafenib combination therapy had been initiated approximately one month prior. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 for the right and left eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed well-circumscribed foveal elevation bilaterally. SD-OCT confirmed sub-foveal neurosensory retinal detachments in both eyes. Cobimetinib/vemurafenib therapy was interrupted for four weeks with improvement in clinical appearance of neurosensory retinal detachments. Treatment was then reinitiated, with a lower dosage of cobimetinib, and serous retinopathy subsequently worsened. The patient remained on vemurafenib monotherapy, while cobimetinib was permanently discontinued, resulting in almost complete resolution of retinopathy.\n\nConclusion(s):\nSerous retinopathy, an uncommon side effect of cobimetinib therapy, requires treatment interruption, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation. Oxidative stress and breakdown of the blood retinal barrier induced by cobimetinib through the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase may play a role in these adverse events. SD-OCT imaging facilitates monitoring for retinopathy in patients taking cobimetinib/vemurafenib combination therapy, which may ultimately result in altered treatment of metastatic melanoma.","title":"Cobimetinib Induced Bilateral Central Serous Retinopathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175152\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Victoria McEwan, Lauren Feroli\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA Hudson Valley Health Care System, VA Hudson Valley Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Chronically, the area involved subsequently resolves into INL atrophy. It was originally considered as a subtype of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) but growing evidence show that it arises from deep capillary retinal plexus ischemia and its pathophysiology may more similar to the well-known cotton wool spots. PAMM can be idiopathic but has been increasingly associated with systemic and retinal vascular diseases as well as extrinsic factors, all with potential to impede perfusion of retinal vasculature.\n\nCase Report:\nA 66-year-old African American with a recent history of hypertensive emergency presents with a subjective paracentral “spot” in his left eye. Signs of hypertensive retinopathy were present in both eyes with a corresponding PAMM lesion subtly visible on fundoscopy. It was confirmed on the SD-OCT with a hyper-reflective band in the INL layer, which resolved into retinal atrophy at the 2-months follow up. FA was unremarkable in its acute phase.\n\nDiscussion:\nDemographic and associated risk factors will be discussed along with pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and management.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOptometrists should not overlook subjective complaints and should further investigate with imaging techniques for lesions that can evade our fundoscopy. There are no current treatments for PAMM but its presence warrants further work-up for potential causative conditions or risk factors.","title":"Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175153\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Xiao Yu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA West Los Angeles\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

His HbA1c is 7.0% and his ocular history is positive for mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy OS x 1 year. Further patient medical history is non-contributory. His best corrected visual acuity in the right eye is 20/20 and 20/30 in the left eye. Anterior segment evaluation is unremarkable in both eyes. The posterior segment evaluation is unremarkable in the right eye. The macula of the left eye is remarkable for scarce micro aneurysms and central foveolar edema extending superiorly. SDOCT shows extensive central subretinal fluid (SRF) and intraretinal fluid (IRF), an adjacent neovascular lesion representing retino-choroidal anastomoses, and a sub-foveal serous pigment epithelial detachment (PED).

The soft silicone diamond dusted tip helps to initiate an edge to abrade epiretinal membranes. This membrane scraping technique became popular starting 1997 as other techniques would create a defect in inner limiting membrane when directly grasped with forceps and other similar tools.\n\nCase Report:\n65-year-old Caucasian male presents with retinal diamond deposits after vitrectomy with membrane peel OS. The patient vision OD was 20/25 and OS 20/80 with normal intraocular pressures. Fundus exam illustrates shiny crystalline diamond deposits in the retina near the macula OS. Red-Free images clearly depicts their presence unlike the Optical Coherence Tomography which does not show signs of diamond remnants as the deposits are not located within the retinal layers.\n\nDiscussion:\nTano diamond dusted membrane scraper was a staple in operating rooms for vitreoretinal surgeries; however, it can leave behind diamond deposits inside the eye. It is inert, does not cause damage and is often vacuumed by the surgeon. Due to new advances in 2014, Alcon’s FINESSE Flex Loop was developed. This new instrument has gained more popularity as it imparts much less trauma to the retinal surface and allows the surgeon to see through the loop to assess any damage. However, not all surgeons have switched over and diamond dust can still be found in retinas which have undergone membrane peels. It is important for optometrists to recognize and not be alarmed when faced with fundus findings of diamond deposits related to retinal surgical procedures.","title":"Diamond Dust Retinopathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175145\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Uncategorized idiopathic choroidal folds are often bilateral and symmetric. Although there are reports in the literature of flattened posterior globes in patients with choroidal folds, this case report details lateral bulging and flattening of the scleral wall in a patient with unilateral choroidal folds.\n\nCase Report:\nAn 82 year-old asymptomatic male demonstrated choroidal folds in the left eye only on routine exam. The folds were evident in the inferior temporal posterior pole and confirmed on OCT macula. No intraocular mass was observed. IOP was normal. B scan revealed no retrobulbar mass and no posterior inflammation. The optics nerves were flat. Best corrected acuity was 20/40 due to meridional amblyopia. Refraction was stable. Bilateral cataract extraction was the only reported ocular surgery. CT scan orbits demonstrated an altered shape of the globe with lateral bulging and flattening of the temporal scleral wall. No orbital mass was detected. Findings were stable over 2 years.\n\nDiscussion:\nThere are reports of flattened posterior globes along with optic nerve enlargement on high resolution CT in patients with acquired hyperopia and choroidal folds. Similar findings were reported in astronauts with optic disc edema and hyperopic shifts after long space flight. In both reports, the altered shape is the posterior portion of the globe surrounding the optic nerve. Given that the retina-choroid layer is designed to lay against the curved wall of the sclera, the mismatch in our patient between curved choroid and flattened sclera may be likened to wallpaper that is not smoothed out when applied. Whether or not this finding was acquired cannot be ascertained. The unexplained deformity in the lateral scleral wall of our patient has not been previously reported and may explain other cases of idiopathic choroidal folds.","title":"Unilateral Choroidal Folds Associated with Lateral Bulging and Flattening of the Globe","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175148\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Loyola University Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Eileen Gable\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Loyola University Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Raman Bhakhri","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/persistent-placoid-maculopathy","text":"Abstract\n\nIntroduction:\nPersistent placoid maculopathy (PPM) is a rarely encountered uveitic condition that was first described in 2006. Patients can present with mild to severe vison loss with sequale including choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM). Clinically the condition is difficult to diagnose as it is rare and resembles other posterior uveitic conditions such as acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE), serpiginous choroidopathy, and acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN). This case highlights a patient who was diagnosed with PPM based on clinical findings, clinical course, and ancillary testing.\n\nCase Report:\nA 55 year old man presented for a comprehensive eye exam. BCVA visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. External examination, entrance testing, and slit lamp examination were unremarkable. IOP's were 17 mmHg OD/OS. Fundus examination revealed large white-yellow placoid lesions OD>OS. On fundus auto-fluorescence imaging (FAF) the lesions had a mottled pattern of hyper auto fluorescence with sparse areas of intermixed hypo-auto fluorescence. No pigment, scarring, or CNVM was noted. SD-OCT through the lesions revealed loss of the outer nuclear layer, photoreceptor integrity line, and external limiting membrane. Standard uveitis testing was unremarkable. Differentials included PPM, APMPPE, serpiginous choroidopathy, and AMN. However, based on the patient’s age, slow progression of the condition, lack of vitreous reaction, lack of pigment, and multimodal imaging, a final diagnosis of PPM was made.\n\nDiscussion:\nPPM is a relatively new and rare posterior uveitis that can be confused for other posterior uveitic conditions.

Subjectively, she felt her central and peripheral vision were unaffected. Fundus photos revealed mild vessel attenuation with subtle hypopigmentary spots along the arcades. No bone spicules were present. SD-OCT revealed preserved ellipsoid in the central 20° of the fovea but marked loss of the ellipsoid in the temporal/nasal perifovea OU. NIR imaging revealed small, white spots along the arcades; AF provided distinct imaging involving a hyperfluorescent ring (parafovea) OU.

While all agents show similar safety profiles and efficacy, the molecular structure and mechanism of action on the VEGF molecule differs. This case highlights the resolution of unilateral ocular hypertension (OHTN) presumed secondary to repeated bevacizumab injections after treatment was switched to aflibercept.\n\nCase Report:\nAn 81 year old WF with unilateral OHTN OS, presumed secondary to repeated IV bevacizumab injections and treated with bimatoprost qhs OS, presented for IOP check 1 week post IV aflibercept for EAMD. IOP was 12mmHg and optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed significant improvement. Following her second aflibercept injection, her OMD discontinued bimatoprost OS and IOP OS was 13 mmHg when she returned to us 1 week later. One month later, untreated IOP was 14mmHg. In addition to sustained lowered IOP, the vision OS improved by 2 lines.\n\nDiscussion:\nOHTN is a rarely discussed potential side effect of anti-VEGF injections optometrists should be aware of. Although the mechanism of development is not well understood, the molecular structure of varying anti-VEGF agents may play a role. Cost serves as a barrier to receiving on-label anti-VEGF therapy. However, this case highlights the importance of tailoring treatment for individual patients to minimize adverse side effects and maximize therapeutic outcomes. Further interesting to this case is the improvement of EAMD findings and vision with the switch in therapy. As optometrists, recognizing adverse side effects of cases we are co-managing and communication with co-managing providers is imperative in order to provide the best outcomes for patients.","title":"Resolution of Unilateral OHTN Associated with Repeated Bevacizumab IV Injections After Switch to Aflibercept","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175151\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kaitlyn Sapoznik\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Margaret Wilczek","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/may-b-a-melanoma","text":"Abstract\n\nIntroduction:\nUveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults despite being relatively uncommon among all melanoma cases. In the category of uveal melanomas, the majority form within the choroid. The main modality for diagnosis of choroidal melanomas is clinical evaluation including both binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy as well as biomicroscopy. Depending on the size and location of the choroidal melanoma, patients often present with symptoms related to vision changes. These changes can range from mild blur to more significant changes such as photopsia, increased number of floaters, metamorphopsia, and visual field loss. The most imperative ancillary test used for identifying ocular melanomas is B-scan ultrasonography. Although ultrasonography serves a significant role in evaluating ocular melanomas, it is rarely, if ever, used as the primary tool for diagnosis. This case report will feature a unique situation in which ultrasonography was the only tool used in diagnosing a choroidal melanoma.\n\nCase Report:\nA 38-year-old Hispanic male presented to Murray Ocular Oncology and Retina with complaints of throbbing eye pain associated with headaches and pressure in both eyes. Approximately six years prior, the patient reports being in a motor vehicle accident that left him comatose for three months. It was at that time that he completely lost vision in his left eye, despite having undergone an unspecified surgical procedure. His best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye was 20/25- with pinhole and no light perception in the left.\n\nUpon examination, the left pupil was entirely occluded and iris bombe was noted. For this reason, a fundus examination could not be performed. To assess the posterior segment of the left eye, the patient underwent B-scan ultrasonography, which revealed a mass located at 4 o’clock just anterior to the equator. The size of the lesion was 12.0 mm by 10.0 mm with a thickness of 5.4 mm.  The ultrasonographer described the mass as being slightly irregular with minimal reflectivity, which is suggestive of a choroidal melanoma. Just adjacent to the borders of the lesion, a shallow detachment of the retina was seen. As per results of the ultrasound, a malignant melanoma was highly suspected and the recommended treatment was enucleation of the left eye due to the absence of visual potential.\n\nConclusion(s):\nB-scan ultrasonography usually serves as an adjunct diagnostic tool in situations when pathology is noted upon clinical examination. In cases where a fundus examination cannot be completed, B-scan ultrasonography is most frequently used to rule out an active retinal detachment or, as in the case of this patient, an intraocular mass. In such rare circumstances, it can play a very crucial role in saving a human life.","title":"May-B a Melanoma?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175142\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Aaron Gold, Timothy Murray, Fiona Ehlies, Lindsay Howse\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Murray Ocular Oncology & Retina, Murray Ocular Oncology & Retina, Murray Ocular Oncology & Retina, Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

It is a retinal degeneration often mistaken for a choroidal mass or uveal melanoma. Patients frequently present with no visual impairment, but may complain of floaters/photopsia and develop severe vision loss.

The patient presented with symptoms of blurry vision, metamorphopsias, and small paracentral scotomas OD.  Her vision OD was 20/40 and OS 20/25 with normal intraocular pressures.  Patient was pseudophakic OD and left eye had a 2+ nuclear sclerosis cataract.  Fundus exam showed small white crystal-like bubbles in the macular region OD.  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) depicts multiple subretinal cyst formations OD.\n\nConclusion(s):\nInadvertent post-operative retention of PFO occurs in approximately 1-3.5% of eyes.  In our patient, the retained PFO was well-tolerated causing minor side-effects of mild blurry wavy vision in our patient. In this particular case, the risk of re-operation was higher than leaving the PFO in place therefore she did not require a re-operation at this time. However, there are evidence of harmful effects of retained PFO in isolated case reports.  Patients with this condition will need to be followed regularly with extensive ophthalmic evaluation and serial OCTs to rule out any signs of ocular toxicity.","title":"Subretinal Perfluoro-N-Octane (PFO) Bubbles Status Post Retinal Detachment Repair","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175144\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

We determined the optimum negative addition lens (NAL) by examining the retinal structure to eliminate refractive VFDs, and hence to help differentiate TDS from potentially sinister pathologies.\n\nMethods:\n10 patients with TDS and 3 patients with neurological VFDs due to retrograde degeneration underwent testing on the Humphrey Field Analyzer 30-2 test pattern using the SITA-Standard paradigm. Four refractive corrections were used: normal correction as recommended by the instrument, or a -1D, -2D and -3D NAL on top of their refractive error. Peripheral retinoscopy was performed to ascertain refractive errors at different horizontal eccentricities. B-scan ultrasound was performed to visualize the posterior retinal bowing, and to estimate the amount of refractive correction required to eliminate the VFD. VFDs were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively using thresholds and probability scores.\n\nResults:\nQualitatively, NALs reduced the extent and depth of the VFDs in patients with TDS, but not in those with retrograde degeneration. There was a correlation between residual refractive error (following the use of NALs) and the improvement in VFD in terms of threshold values (p=0.0145) and probability scores (p=0.0003) in patients with TDS. A greater proportion of points showed improvement in both threshold and probability score when the residual refraction was within 0.75D (55.4%) compared to residuals of ≥1D (27.9%, p\n\nConclusion(s):\nExamining peripheral refraction and ocular structure can guide NAL selection to optimally reduce the refractive VFDs in patients with TDS. This offers a potential method for differentiating between refractive and true pathological VFDs.","title":"Structure-Function Analysis of Tilted Disc Syndrome Reveals the Optimal Negative Addition Lens for Eliminating Refractive Scotomas","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175135\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Henrietta Wang, Sieu Khuu, Sephora Miao, Lydia Zhou, Michael Kalloniatis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health University of New South Wales, Centre for Eye Health University of New South Wales, Centre for Eye Health University of New South Wales, Centre for Eye Health University of New South Wales, Centre for Eye Health University of New South Wales\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, recent reports have revealed that patients of Asian heritage taking HCQ can develop retinopathy in the pericentral area. Treatment is to discontinue use of HCQ, because toxicity is generally irreversible. Furthermore, progression can be seen even after discontinuation of the drug.\n\nCase Report:\nA 50 year-old male of Southeast Asian descent presented for a follow up on his recent diagnosis of normal tension glaucoma. The patient had been taking 400 mg/day of HCQ since 2004 for systemic lupus erythematosus. His daily dose by weight was 4.39 mg/kg. Latanoprost QHS OU was started 6 months ago when he was diagnosed with glaucoma. His visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and OS. His cup-to-disc ratio was OD 0.6H/0.65V with a thinner superior rim and OS 0.5H/0.55V. Humphrey visual field (HVF) 24-2 Sita Standard revealed moderate progressive superior temporal arcuate defects extending from the optic nerve that was first seen 16 months ago. The HVF defects did not correlate with stable stereo disc photographs or stable optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal nerve fiber layer analysis. However, the defects did correlate with loss of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and interdigitation zone (IZ) lines, greater inferiorly in the perimacular area. Multifocal electroretinogram findings indicated inferior loss that correlated with the superior HVF defects, despite normal findings on fundus autofluorescence. Treatment for glaucoma was discontinued and the patient’s rheumatologist was notified of our exam findings along with recommendations to discontinue use of HCQ.\n\nConclusion(s):\nPericentral hydroxychloroquine retinopathy can present with visual field defects that may mimic glaucomatous visual field defects.","title":"A case of pericentral hydroxychloroquine retinopathy diagnosed as glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175136\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Megan Carter, Lee Vien, David Yang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA Palo Alto, VA Palo Alto, VA Palo Alto\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Onset occurs between the ages of 3 and 40, with markedly elevated IOP as the presenting sign. Treatment often involves surgery, as traditional topical and laser intervention is less successful. Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive peripheral vision loss and nyctalopia. Age of onset may vary, although it is usually diagnosed in early adulthood. There is no known cure.\n\nCase Report:\nAn 11 year old African American female presented to clinic having lost the glasses prescribed to her at age 8. Previous records noted 20/20 vision OD, OS, low hyperopia, elevated IOP (22mmHg OD, 33mmHg OS) and moderate ONH cupping. Fundus photos were taken, but follow up appointments were not kept as recommended. Current acuity is now 20/20 OD, LP OS, with the patient denying that she had realized vision in her left eye was reduced. IOP was 20mmHg OD, 42mmHg OS, with 0.4 OD and 0.99 cupping OS. Dilated exam revealed bone spicule changes OU, not previously noted. The patient was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa OU and juvenile glaucoma OS. Subsequent electrodiagnostic testing confirmed RP, and topical medications prescribed OS lowered the IOP to 20mmHg. Low vision evaluation provided glasses as well as activity/performance recommendations. At this time no other family members are known to be affected.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe first case of retinitis pigmentosa associated with glaucoma was recorded in 1862. Since that time, most of the correlation between RP patients and glaucoma involves acute angle closure or ICE syndromes. RP has not been associated with any of the primary or secondary juvenile glaucomas. This patient, at this time, appears to be an isolated case. However, ocular anatomic structures will be monitored over time to ensure that anterior chamber angle or other anomalies do not develop.","title":"Retinitis Pigmentosa Presents with Associated Juvenile Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175137\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        HK Yin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this presumed rare disorder is that it may be “Occult” or invisible to ophthalmoscopy in its early stages. After reviewing more than 400 cases, Yannuzzi et al proposed in 2014 a new classification based upon Multimodal Imaging.\n\nCase Report:\nWe report on 3 select patients diagnosed with AZOOR and followed for 25, 23 and 11 years respectively:\n\nCase #1 was patient #12 in the first paper AZOOR paper published by Gass. Symptoms of a blind spot and photopsias in the right eye date back to 1988 when she was in her 30’s. VA was 20/25 and 20/20 and fields revealed a dense superior arcuate scotoma in the OD and an enlarged blindspot OS. Although the fundus was judged normal in this era before OCTs, the full field flash ERG was quite reduced in the OD. Two decades later, the VA was HM OD and 20/70 OS. The fundus exam revealed all the classical signs of advanced RP OU. Genetic testing for RP was unrevealing.\n\nCase #2: A 35 yo male presented with a 9 yr history of vision problems after his car was rear ended. His blurred vision and temporal field loss was not explainable and w normal MRI’s, it was concluded that he was malingering. His first ERGs 9 yrs later were abnormal and worsened over time. His fundus, initially normal, developed bilateral peripapillary pigmentary changes and histo type spots in the periphery as his VA and visual fields worsened.\n\nCase #3: A 71 yo female complained of visual disturbance OD only. About a decade later, her OS developed photopsias as well. All tests supported a Dx of AZOOR.\n\nDiscussion:\nIn these 3 select cases with long term follow-up, AZOOR progressed and became bilateral.\n\nConclusion(s):\nAZOOR can present with no visible fundus findings and progress to profound and widespread lesions, even resembling advance RP.","title":"Long Term Follow-up of 3 AZOOR Patients","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175138\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

However in a subset of patients, it may be associated with ipsilateral high myopia and amblyopia. These cases are characterized by dense superior temporal MRNF and axial myopia. Vision is generally poor (around 20/200) and several case reports have demonstrated that these patients are relatively refractory to amblyopia therapy. The poor vision was historically attributed to anisometropic amblyopia. However, a more recent case series demonstrated a structural abnormality using SD-OCT, with all three subjects having attenuated or absent photoreceptors.\n\nCase Report:\nA 69 year old male presented as a new patient with a complaint of distance blur OD. He reported poor vision OS since birth. Manifest refraction and best corrected visual acuities were +1.25 -1.00 x 090 (20/20) OD and -6.00 -3.00 x 105 (20/200) OS. Cover test revealed an orthophoric posture. Pupil testing and extraocular motilities were normal. Examination of the anterior segment was only significant for nuclear sclerotic cataracts OU. Goldmann applanation tonometry was 16 mmHg OD and 15 mmHg OS. The C/D was 0.20 OD and 0.15 OS. Dilated fundoscopy revealed dense MRNF surrounding the disc and extending into the superior temporal arcade OS. The maculae were flat and clear OU. SD-OCT was obtained and revealed intact retinal layers OD. The retinal pigment epithelium was intact OS but the photoreceptors were absent throughout the scan. The patient was educated on the findings and was prescribed polycarbonate glasses for full time wear.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis case demonstrates the recent association made between the triad of MRNF, myopia and amblyopia and attenuated or absent photoreceptors on OCT. This is a new finding and likely explains why these patients generally do not respond to amblyopia therapy. OCT should be acquired on all patients with MRNF and poor vision.","title":"SD-OCT in the Triad of Myelinated Retinal Nerve Fibers, Myopia and Amblyopia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175139\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA Palo Alto Healthcare System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) was presented as a possible cause for PPRS by Lee et al. in 2016. The pathogenesis is not fully understood although indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) in cases of CSCR have demonstrated thickened hypermeable choroidal vessels which leak more fluid. This causes mechanical stress to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), causing pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs), as well as to the lamina cribrosa (LC) possibly causing PPRS. Another proposed origin of the PPRS fluid is from the subarachnoid space.\n\nCase Report:\nA 56-year-old white male presented to the eye clinic due to subjective metamorphopsia with visual disturbances in the past when stressed from work. His ocular history was pertinent for recurrent CSCR OU without treatment. His systemic history was significant for hepatitis C, polysubstance abuse, and bipolar disorder. His best corrected visual acuities were 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Dilated examination revealed RPE clumping superior to the fovea OD and round elevations inferior temporal to the fovea OU. Cirrus Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with enhanced depth imaging revealed an overall thickened macula with multiple small PEDs and a PPRS of multiple layers with a thickened choroid OU. Signs of optic disc abnormalities were absent on optic nerve evaluation. Review of prior OCT images did not reveal the newly diagnosed PPRS OU. The PPRS had a stable presentation the following month on evaluation by a retinal specialist and the patient was to return in 6 months for follow up.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis case demonstrates unusual acute bilateral PPRS associated with CSCR. The fluid in the PPRS is proposed to be related to a thicker, hyperpermeable choroid and mechanical stress on the RPE and LC.","title":"Atypical Acute Bilateral Peripapillary Retinoschisis Associated With Central Serous Chorioretinopathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175141\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lee Vien\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA Palo Alto Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has been implicated in multiple types of cancer, including cutaneous melanoma. Several pharmacological treatments for metastatic melanoma specifically target various molecules within this pathway, including BRAF-inhibitors (Vemurafenib) and MEK-inhibitors (Cobimetinib). Ocular pathology, including serous-like retinopathy (MEK-associated retinopathy), has been reported with MEK-inhibitors. We describe a case of bilateral MEK-associated retinopathy which developed during treatment of metastatic melanoma with these two agents.\n\nCase Report:\nA 72-year-old male was evaluated for subjective visual change that corresponded with initiation of oral Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib therapy. Entering visual acuity with habitual correction was 20/20-2 OD and 20/30 OS. Pupils, extraocular eye motility, and confrontation visual fields were normal. Slit lamp examination revealed mild cataracts. Evaluation of the posterior segment showed bilateral subretinal yellowish exudate within the fovea. Heidelberg retinal tomography was performed and revealed bilateral subfoveal fluid. Fluorescein angiography confirmed the diagnosis of serous macular detachment with no macular leakage present consistent with MEK-associated retinopathy. Despite this finding, the patient’s health care team decided that discontinuation of systemic cancer therapy posed a greater threat to the patient’s health than the medications’ retinal toxicity. The patient is being followed carefully by his eye care provider. No change in vision or retinal pathology has been noted over the past 2 months.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe mechanism by which MEK-inhibitors cause retinopathy has not been definitively determined, but it is believed that the medications may disrupt proteins that regulate fluid transport in the retinal pigment epithelium. In most patients, subretinal fluid resolves upon discontinuation of the medication.","title":"Bilateral Serous-like Chorioretinopathy with MEK Inhibitor use for Metastatic Melanoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175132\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Muriel Schornack\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Mayo Clinic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

There has been a reported case of optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of intraocular cystecircosis, albeit the images were only suggestive of the scolex without much detail.  However, our Heidelberg OCT findings showed the intestine and scolex of the larvae in great detail; similar to histopathological features. This case report will describe the oct findings and discuss the treatment and management of ocular cysticercosis.\n\nCase Report:\nSixteen year old Hispanic male seen in the emergency department of Bascom Palmer with sudden, painless blurred vision in the right eye, onset of two weeks. Social history remarkable for recent travel to Nicaragua where he ate uncooked pork meat. Fundus evaluation showed a superior juxtapapillary, subretinal cystic lesion with chorioretinal scarring, and focal retinal detachment.  Patient was seen in neurology clinic with a negative MRI. He was seen in retina service where the OCT precisely outlined the intestine and scolex of the tapeworm. He successfully underwent a pars plana vitrectomy and removal of the cyst.\n\nConclusion(s):\nCysticercosis is a serious condition that can cause permanent deficits in the nervous and visual system. With the use of OCT, we are able to visualize the intestine as well as scolex of the encapsulated larvae. The OCT findings were closely associated to the histopathological findings. All patient with suspicion of cysticercosis should be referred to neurology for an MRI. In conclusion, detection and prompt surgical removal of the cyst is essential and mandatory to preserve vision.","title":"Optical Coherence Tomography Characteristics of Subretinal Cysticercosis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175133\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Tanuj Banker\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Bascom Palmer Eye Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

These lesions mimic drusen and are often misdiagnosed as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). SD-OCT may be a useful technique to assist in distinguishing these two conditions.\n\nCase Report:\nPatient 1, an 85yo WM, complained of blurry vision OU. BCVA were 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. Dilated eye exam revealed mild RPE changes OD, and a large elevated yellow lesion OS. SD-OCT revealed a small lesion between the inner/outer segment (IS/OS) interface and the RPE band OD, and a large vitelliform-like lesion OS consistent with AOFVD. Patient 2, a 72yo WM, reported blurry vision OS at distance. BCVA were 20/30 OD and 20/60 OS. Dilated eye exam revealed several small drusen OS>OD, and a large elevated lesion OS. SD-OCT confirmed small drusen OU, and a large pigment epithelial detachment (PED) with mild sub-retinal fluid OS, consistent with wet AMD.\n\nConclusion(s):\nAOFVD and AMD have similar clinical features making differentiation challenging. SD-OCT may distinguish subtle differences between these conditions. The early yellow subretinal deposits in AOFVD on OCT have been localized between the IS/OS interface and the RPE band. In contrast, AMD drusen have been described as irregularities generally within the level of the RPE on OCT. AOFVD progression presents as a large vitelliform lesion, similar to PED in AMD. It has been suggested that vitelliform lesions in AOFVD may maintain photoreceptor integrity and visual function longer than AMD, because the contact between the apical RPE and IS/OS is preserved. PED lesions in AMD exhibit RPE elevation and gradual IS/OS loss. Since both conditions may develop choroidal neovascularization leading to significant vision loss, SD-OCT is useful in differentiating between AOFVD and AMD, and identifying the need for further treatment.","title":"SD-OCT May Help Differentiate Adult-Onset Fovealmacular Vitelliform Dystrophy from Age-Related Macular Degeneration","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175134\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Kaiser Permanente - Northwest\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Richard Claiborne\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Northwest Kaiser Permanente\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The introduction will explain the theory that military personnel serving in the Gulf region between 1990 and 1991\ns\nuffered from toxin exposure which activated pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to a chronic and systemic inflammatory response.  This resulting inflammatory state has been deemed Gulf War Illness. We present a case report of a middle-aged African American female with a chief complaint of debilitating glare at night. Changes in her vision were first noted with toxin exposure from the burning oil fields while she was serving during the Gulf War. Her clinical presentation was initially diagnosed as macular degeneration, and later familial drusen, although further research of recent family member eye exams reveals an absence of retinal drusen in immediate blood relatives. Optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and electroretinography, along with other pertinent test results will be presented.

One potential method to measure the convergence of retinal biomass is by measuring the differences in thickness of individual layers of the retina that house the relevant cell nuclei. We have proposed a metric to examine convergence called the INL/ONL ratio. It has been shown previously, that retina layers can show differences due to age, gender and gender. The purpose of this study is to examine gender, race, and age effects on the INL/ONL ratio.\n\nMethods:\n376 subjects (ages 4-50 years old) signed informed consents approved by the Indiana University IRB. 72 of the adult subjects returned for a one year follow up. Retinal thickness data was collected by SD OCT along with axial length. After automated segmentation, thickness ratios were calculated by dividing the INL thickness by the ONL thickness at every location along the horizontal and vertical plane.\n\nResults:\nLooking at age by decade of life, there was no statistical difference for the INL/ONL ratio for any decade between 11 and 40 yrs. The INL/ONL was significantly higher on average between the ages of 0 to 10 years of age compared to all other decades (P = 0.024.) The young children on average had 12% higher ratios across all retinal locations. No differences for the INL/ONL ratio were noted between race or gender. The INL/ONL did not change over the course of 1 year for the follow-up subjects.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe increased INL/ONL ratio in young children is logical considering the development of the fovea and the ongoing neural remodeling. Current clinical work on amblyopia would suggest that neural remodeling, whether retinal or in the brain, may be ongoing up to the age of 10. This study found no gender or race differences suggesting retina thickness differences between race/gender may be due to overall changes.","title":"Longitudinal Age, Gender, and Race Differences in the INL/ONL Ratio as a Measure of Retinal Convergence","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175126\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Casey Carr, Theodore Chow, Ann Elsner\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University, Indiana University, Indiana University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

It is an immunosuppressant that downregulates the sphingosine 1–phosphate receptor 1 on lymphocytes. Macular edema (ME) is an infrequent reported adverse event (AE) typically occurring within 3 months of initiation of treatment and resolving upon discontinuation. We report a case of ME in a patient receiving fingolimod outside of the 3 month period with a quick successful resolution.\n\nCase Report:\nA 52-year-old woman with complaints of decreased vision in her right eye of gradual onset was seen in the clinic. She began treatment for MS with fingolimod, 0.5 mg/d, 6 months earlier. She reported a positive history of well-managed HTN and denied a history of other systemic illness including vision problems or previous ocular disease.\n\nBest-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OD & OS. Anterior segment examination included ECCEcIOL and otherwise was unremarkable. Fundus exam and optical coherence tomography showed macular cystic changes in the right eye. A working diagnosis of fingolimod-associated ME (FAME) was made.\n\nDiscussion:\nAfter consultation with neurology, a decision was made to stop fingolimod use resulting in observable resolution of her ME and restoration of 20/20 vision after 4 weeks. Although a relatively uncommon occurrence after 3 months of treatment, clinicians should be suspicious of macular edema observed after initiation of Fingolimod.\n\nConclusion(s):\nFingolimod-associated macular edema (FAME) appears as a rare ophthalmic AE typically observed within 3 months of therapy.

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), ultra wide-field fundus autofluorescence (UWF-AF), and color fundus photos and analyzed for each patient. Results from the Rabin Cone Contrast Test (RCCT) were also obtained.\n\nResults:\nSTGD subjects were categorized into three categories based on BCVA (Mild: better than 20/40, Moderate: 20/40-20/200, Severe: worse than 20/200). Eyes in the Mild category (4) displayed a thickened external limiting membrane (ELM) and attenuated photoreceptor integrity line/ellipsoid zone (PIL/EZ) on SD-OCT, hyperAF areas and/or flecks surrounding the macula on UWF AF, and scores of 47.5 (out of 100) for L-cones, 43.75 for M-cones and 97.5 for S-cones on the RCCT. Eyes in the Moderate category (3) showed absence of ELM or PIL/EZ subfoveally on SD-OCT, varying patterns of hypo and hyper AF in the macula on UWF-AF, and average RCCT scores of 27.5 (L), 0.0 (M), and 60.0(S). Eyes in the Severe (9) category showed absence of ELM and PIL/EZ subfoveally and thinning of the RPE, hypo and hyperAF patterns in the macula and/or posterior pole, and average RCCT scores of 1.25 (L), 0 (M), 40(S).\n\nConclusion(s):\nProfound structural and functional abnormalities were identified in subjects with mild or no visual symptoms when color fundus photos were not diagnostic . SD-OCT, UWF-AF, and RCCT may be key tools in diagnosing STGD earlier and monitoring progression.","title":"Structural and Functional Biomarkers for an Earlier Diagnosis of Stargardt Disease","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175128\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jerome Sherman\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

It was used to describe retinal hemorrhages in association with heavy lifting, coughing, straining at stool, or vomiting. This case illustrates the response of a Valsalva maculopathy to a single injection of anti-VEGF therapy.\n\nCase report:\nA 51 year old male patient with co-morbidities of diabetes and hypertension wanted to control his systemic disease state with exercise. In a non-supervised exercise program, the patient developed a Valsalva maculopathy with \"free weight\" lifting. Over exertion resulted in Valsalva maculopathy in the superior macular location threatening best corrected acuity and resulted in the decision to utilize medical therapy (anti-VEGF injection) to reduce the risk of acuity loss.\n\nDiscussion:\nValsalva retinopathy/maculopathy occurs in 4 separate and distinct phases. First, a sudden increase in intrathoracic pressure decreases venous return to the right side of the heart. Second, diminished cardiac filling lowers the mean arterial pressure, slowing the pulse, leading to reflex tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction. Third, release of the strain causes a prompt reduction in the intrathoracic pressure, further lowering the blood pressure and simultaneously increasing the cardiac pressure. Finally, an abrupt increase in blood pressure occurs as venous blood surges back to the heart, inducing reflex bradycardia.\n\nConclusion(s)\n: Our patient was treated with a single injection of anti-VEGF because the position of the hemorrhage was less than 500 microns from the fovea, located superiorly and threatening visual acuity. The hemorrhage cleared very quickly after the treatment. Several authors have advocated the use of Nd: YAG hyaloidotomy / membranotomy to assist in visual recovery. This is a unique case were anti-VEGF was used to treat the Valsalva maculopathy.","title":"Valsalva Maculopathy Treated with Anti-VEGF Therapy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175129\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern California College of Optometry-SCCO\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        David Sendrowski, Mark Bronstein\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        MBKU/SCCO, UCI/SCCO/MBKU\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

To assess the consistency of the ratio of PR/HFL thickness across the central macula.\n\nMethods:\nMacula centered images were acquired in 11 clinically normal subjects using commercially available SLP with fixed compensator (GDx, CZM) and optical coherence tomographer (Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering). PR distribution was assessed using custom Matlab software, calculating the amplitude of the birefringent macular cross pattern pixel intensity in circular regions of interest centered on the fovea. HFL thickness was quantified using D-OCT, offsetting the imaging beam by 3mm through the pupil in 4 quadrants (superior, inferior, nasal, temporal). HFL thickness was manually segmented and thickness in pixels averaged across the 4 meridians at each eccentricity. PR and HFL thickness across all eccentricities were compared using linear regression for each subject. Linear regression was used to assess the ratio of PR/HFL averaged across all subjects between 0 and 3 deg in 0.25 deg increments.\n\nResults:\nAll subjects demonstrated an intact macular cross and normal Henle fiber layer thickness distribution. When considering all eccentricities, HFL PR and thickness were highly correlated in each subject (R2 range 0.896 to 0.9801). The ratio of PR/HFL thickness ranged from 2.324 to 2.731 and was poorly correlated across eccentricities (R2 = 0.0112, regression slope of 0.0157).\n\nConclusion(s):\nFoveal PR intensity is closely correlated with HFL thickness. In a normal cohort, PR/HFL thickness was consistent across all retinal eccentricities within 3 deg of the fovea. The RP/HFL is stable in a normal population and a potential biomarker for neurodegenerative retinal changes in the central macula where polarization and thickness changes are known to change independently.","title":"Quantification of Phase Retardation as a Function of Thickness in the Henle Fiber Layer","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175130\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Marisa Ciamacca, Aaron Zimmerman, Andrew Hartwick\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

He was referred for a potential tumor due to an obstructed view of the right eye posterior segment. The patient was in good systemic health with no current medications.\n\nCase Report:\nBest-corrected visual acuities were 20/63 OD and 20/16 OS through -4.00 DS OD and -4.25 DS OS. A dull fundus reflex was noted OD. Pupils were normal with no RAPD and biomicroscopy showed no cells or flare. IOP was 11 mm Hg OD and 12 mm Hg OS. The nasal quadrant of the right eye pupil failed to dilate completely. Fundus examination OD revealed diffuse vitreous haze and a large exudative retinal detachment due to a choroidal lesion spanning from 1 to 5 o’clock, sparing the macula.\n\nAssesment:\nB-scan ultrasound showed a circumferential retinochoroidal mass with no calcification or excavation of underlying ocular structures. The dimensions of the tumor were 21.7mm ¿ 21.2mm ¿ 12.5mm. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed anterior iris displacement from 3 to 5 o’clock. A large homogeneous mass containing multiple cystic spaces was noted. There was the presence of a lental apposition to the mass, retrolental cyclytic membrane. This atypical presentation led to the finding of a ciliary body tumor supplied by sentinel vessels extending to the retina causing exudative retinal detachment. Chest CT was performed to rule out pleuropulmonary blastoma. MRI results showed hypointense signal in T2 weighted imaging with respect to the vitreous. Based on the findings we suspected this case to be an amelanotic melanoma or medulloepithelioma.\n\nManagement:\nWe referred him to an ocular oncologist for fine needle aspiration biopsy under general anesthesia. Histopathology reports confirmed the presence of intraocular medulloepithelioma. Since the tumor base was too large for globe salvage and too thick for radioactive plaque, enucleation was performed and a vicryl mesh wrapped orbital ball implant was inserted.","title":"Intraocular Medulloepithelioma in a 15-Year-Old: A Rare Presentation","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175131\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        James Kundart\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an emerging non-invasive imaging technology that allows\nin vivo\nvisualization of the retinal and choroidal vasculatures. The recent advent of OCTA has provided insights into structural and functional vascular characteristics of various retinal disorders including RP.\n\nCase Report:\nThe OCTA characteristics of a 33 yo female patient with severe RP were compared to a control subject with same gender and similar age. Qualitative analysis revealed definite decrease in capillary density in the macular area, ranging from mild perifoveally, to gradually more severe moving away from the fovea. In addition, the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) seemed relatively intact. This correlates with the patient’s visual field which shows only a small central area of remaining vision, as well as with the SD-OCT that shows preservation of the photoreceptor integrity line (PIL) subfoveally only and discontinuation in the remainder of the macula.\n\nConclusion(s):\nRP is a vision-threatening condition with currently no effective treatment.

Following presentation of the case history, preliminary tests and fundus photography, participants were prompted for their diagnosis, management and imaging preference. One additional imaging result (multispectral images, fundus autofluorescence, or optical coherence tomography – OCT) was then provided and the questions repeated.

While OCTA has furthered our understanding of diabetic macular vasculopathy, little has been reported regarding imaging of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). This case highlights the utility of OCTA in the early detection of preretinal neovascularization and monitoring regression following treatment.\n\nCase Report:\nA 56 year-old Hispanic female with a history of type II diabetes for 27 years was referred for evaluation of questionable disc neovascularization (NVD). Ophthalmoscopy revealed active NVD 1/2 disc area (DA) in size OD and indiscrete NVD OS appearing as a red dot on the neuroretinal rim. In addition, scattered blot hemorrhages, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), partial PVD with persistent optic nerve attachment, and arteriolar attenuation were observed OU. No macular edema was present OU. OCTA imaging (ZEISS AngioPlex®) revealed significant nonperfusion (NP) in the midperiphery totaling ~15 DAs OD, 10 DAs OS. OCTA confirmed the presence of NVD OU which was visible on the vitreoretinal interface preset segmentation map. The NVD OD was seen growing on the partially detached posterior hyaloid. Conversely, the NVD OS was located in an area where the posterior hyaloid remained attached to the disc margin; the new vessels appeared to be growing unsupported into the vitreous cavity. The patient was diagnosed with high risk PDR OD and low risk PDR OS. Panretinal photocoagulation was performed OD with post-op OCTA imaging revealing regressed NVD at one week.\n\nConclusion(s)\n: As illustrated, OCTA is a valuable tool for early detection of subtle PDR, monitoring treatment response, and characterizing morphologic features of neovascular tissue. It serves as a noninvasive means to visualize widespread retinal NP that may stimulate proliferation.","title":"The Utility of Optical Coherence Topography Angiography in Detecting Early Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy and Monitoring Regression: A Case Report","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175124\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        David Juett, Carolyn Majcher, Stephanie Barbieri\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Rosenberg School of Optometry, Rosenberg School of Optometry, University of the Incarnate Word Rosenberg School of Optome\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The effect of abnormal revascularization on retinal structure and function is unclear. This was investigated in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) using in vivo methods.\n\nMethods:\n18 OIR mice (exposed to hyperoxia) and 18 room air (RA) mice underwent simultaneous in vivo imaging with scotopic electroretinography (ERG), fluorescein angiography (FA), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography at post-natal age(s) (P) 20 and P40. Retinal avascular area, vein width, and arterial tortuosity as well as retinal thickness and ERG parameters (amplitudes and implicit times for a and b waves) were determined.\n\nResults:\nPercent retinal avascular area in the FA image was similar in OIR and RA mice at P20 and P40 (P=0.0823). P20 OIR mice had larger RVWs than P20 RA mice (P=0.0044). Retinal arteries were more tortuous in OIR than RA mice at P20 (P=0.0001) and P40 (P=0.0001).

Inner retinal thinning corresponded with vascular abnormalities and impaired b-wave signaling in OIR mice. Abnormalities in retinal vascularization were associated with abnormalities in retinal structure and function. Thus, monitoring functional and structural changes together with vascular abnormalities would enhance understanding of ROP pathogenesis and aid discovery of novel therapies.","title":"In vivo Imaging Correlates Retinal Angiogenesis with Retinal Structure and Function in a Mouse Model of Retinopathy of Prematurity","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175112\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Wisconsin, Madison\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Thao Adams, Lauren Taylor, Adaure Nwaba, Jens Eickhoff\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Wisconsin Madison, Department of Pediatrics University of Wisconsin Madison, School of Arts and Sciences Johns Hopkins University, Department of Pediatrics University of Wisconsin Madison\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This disease culminates in the degeneration of photoreceptors. However, the knowledge of the remodeling of inner retinal neurons due to photoreceptor degeneration is limited. This study was undertaken to examine the influence of deletion of Rp2, an RP-causing gene on the extent of rod and cone photoreceptor degeneration and retinal remodeling in different strains of Rp2 mutant mice.\n\nMethods:\nFour Rp2-mutant mice were generated: Rp2null, Rp2MKO (deletion of Rp2 specifically in cones), Rp2iKO(deletion of Rp2 in rods), and Rp2-DKO (knock out of Rp2 in all-cone retina of Nrlko mice). Eyes were enucleated from these mice as per approved protocol, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and processed for cryosectioning and staining. Glial cell activation was assessed by examining Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. The function of photoreceptors was assessed by electroretinography (ERG) and the morphological changes were confirmed by TEM.\n\nResults:\nConstitutive loss of Rp2 (Rp2null) resulted in abnormal extension of the cone outer segment (COS). Similar result was obtained when the Rp2 gene was ablated specifically in cones but not when ablated in rods. TEM analysis revealed the elongated COS with abnormal ultrastructure and disorganized lamellae. There was also an increase in GFAP immunoreactivity in retinal sections of mutant mice. ERG results confirmed the reduced functionality of photoreceptors. Remodeling at the photoreceptor-bipolar cell synapse was also observed in the Rp2null mice.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur results suggest that in addition to the photoreceptors, inner retinal neurons undergo remodeling to cope with the disease. Examining inner retinal remodeling in RP animal models may provide crucial insights into designing future gene-delivery and other modes of therapies to prevent or delay loss of vision in humans.","title":"Mouse Models to Study Progression of Photoreceptor Degeneration and Inner Retinal Remodeling in Retinitis Pigmentosa","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175113\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        MCPHS University, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Hemant Khanna\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dept. of Ophthalmology UMASS Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Clinically it is a focal, white, elevated retinal mass within the posterior pole or mid-peripheral retina and is not associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. The nomenclature of this lesion was revised after SDOCT findings showed that the lesion was located in the outer retina, where astrocytes are not typically present. This “pearl white” retinal mass has been hypothesized to arise from retinal glial cells including Muller cells, microglia, or pigment epithelial cells. The pathogenesis and histopathology of this lesion are not yet known.\n\nCase report:\nA 43 year old black male with visual acuity 20/20 OD and OS presented with a mid-peripheral, solitary, white, elevated retinal lesion with surrounding RPE hyperplasia and overlying vitreous syneresis. Ultrasonography showed a dome-shaped lesion 5.5x5.4mm, less than one mm in height without extraocular extension or calcification. SDOCT showed an intraretinal elevated smooth lesion with overlying retinal draping and optical shadowing. OCTA showed an elevated lesion with inherent fine vasculature without the presence of a feeder vessel. The lesion was stable over a 14 month period.\n\nConclusion(s):\nNovel OCTA findings of this solitary retinal mass located within the deep retina aids in the understanding of this rare benign retinal tumor. Without known histopathology, it may be hypothesized from clinical examination and multimodal imaging studies that this lesion is of glial cell origin or may be of aberrant astrocyte origin within the outer retina.","title":"Multimodal Imaging and Optical Coherence Angiography Findings in Solitary Circumscribed “Pearl White” Retinal Mass","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175115\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University, College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Brandon Prete, Aaron Gold, Timothy Murray\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Conlon Eye Institute (Saskatoon SK Canada), Murray Ocular Oncology and Retina, Murray Ocular Oncology and Retina\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

OCTA allows for valuable insight into the microvascular circulation of various retinal and choroidal disorders allowing for an in-depth analysis of pathological alterations in specific disease states including retinal vascular occlusion (RVO).\n\nCase Report:\nA 58 y/o diabetic, hypertensive male presented with complaints of decreased vision OS x 2months with light sensitivity and pain. He reported a BS of 225 but was unsure of his HBA1C. BCVA OD was 20/20 and 20/200 OS. Anterior segment exam was unremarkable. Fundoscopy revealed widespread hemorrhaging in the posterior pole, vascular tortuosity and macular edema consistent with CRVO OS. OCTA was performed and identified significant vascular changes to the DCP including widespread ischemia and capillary non-perfusion. A disturbance in macular microcirculation can be visualized on OCTA as an enlarged, asymmetric FAZ with irregularity of the surrounding vascular arcades. These findings provide insight into the causative factor behind the visual impairment associated with CRVO.\n\nDiscussion:\nFluorescein Angiography (FA) has historically been used in the evaluation of RVO as it has identified abnormalities at the level of the superficial capillary plexus including enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). However, FA does not provide segmentation into the individual vascular layers and thus is unable to visualize the deep capillary blood supply. OCTA has allowed for precise visualization of abnormalities at the deep capillary plexus (DCP) in RVO.\n\nConclusion(s):\nDepth encoded mapping via OCTA of CRVO patients has allowed for enhanced visualization of the microvascular changes occurring at the level of the DCP. These changes are directly correlated with the level of visual impairment suggesting that these changes are functionally relevant.","title":"OCT Angiography in Central Retinal Vein Occlusion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175116\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        NOVA Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Leticia Rousso, Perla Najman, Pinar Haytac\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

OCT OS revealed outer macular atrophy with an empty cavity in the inner retinal layers.  OCT-A demonstrated hyperreflectivity temporal to the foveas .  Case 2: An 81 yo woman complained of monocular diplopia worse OD. BCVAs were 20/40 in each eye. She was thought to have a hereditary macular dystrophy.  OCT OD and OS revealed outer and inner macular atrophy and RPE pigment migration.  OCT-A demonstrated  hyperreflectivity temporal to the foveas .\n\nDiscussion:\nIn MacTel Type 2, fluorescein angiography (FA)  demonstrates telangiectatic capillaries mostly temporal to the fovea  in the early phase and a diffuse hyperfluorescence in the late phase.  SD-OCT may reveal outer retinal atrophy, pigment migration, hyporeflective spaces in the inner or outer retina, and macular thinning in later stage.  OCT-A  in these two cases revealed temporal hyperreflectivity indicative of anomalous blood vessels temporal to the fovea., like FA.\n\nConclusions:\nMacTel Type 2 can be diagnosed using OCT and OCT-A thereby decreasing the need for FA. It can be performed in the optometric setting resulting in a more timely diagnosis.","title":"OCT Angiography (OCT-A) Findings in Macular Telangiectasia (Mac-Tel) Type 2","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175117\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kim Poirier\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The condition is slow progressing and rarely affects vision. There are sources suggesting an association between Leber's aneurysms, Coats' disease, and idiopathic macular telangiectasia.\n\nCase Report:\nWe present a case of an asymptomatic 57 year old male with unilateral retinal macroaneurysms, capillary dilations, and exudates confined to one quadrant of the left eye. Visual acuity was not affected by the retinal findings. A 6x6mm OCT angiography image over the area showed hyperfluorescence of a blood vessel in the vitreoretinal interface image. This was suspicious for retinal neovascularization. The patient was suspected to have Leber's miliary aneurysms predominantly based upon exclusion of vascular or diabetic etiologies.\n\nDiscussion:\nLeber's miliary aneurysms is classified as a primary retinal telangiectasia with a unilateral occurrence marked by the presence of aneurysmal dilations of arterioles and capillaries and clustered in one or two quadrants in the mid-peripheral retina. No systemic associations related to Leber's miliary aneurysms have been uncovered. The extravasation around the vessels is mild and unless extends into the macula, visual acuity will not be affected. It is also slow in progression, if it occurs at all. The exact mechanism that leads to these telangiectatic and aneurysmal changes is not well understood, but it is considered a congenital abnormality.\n\nConclusion(s):\nRetinal telangiectasias can have variable presentations and may often be mistaken for various other retinal pathologies. In diagnosing these conditions, it is prudent to actively rule out other etiologies, especially those that may require systemic intervention. It is critical to monitor the patient closely for development of retinal neovascularization and macular edema, both of which have the potential to be visually devastating.","title":"A Case of Retinal Telangiectasia in an Asymptomatic 57 Year Old African American Male","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175118\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Ophthalmoscopically, papilledema presents with elevation and swelling, which appearance can be mimicked by a group of benign conditions collectively referred to as pseudopapilledema. Distinguishing between papilledema and pseudopapilledema is crucial but at times challenging. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an emerging technology that provides a quick and noninvasive mapping of the optic nerve vasculature and peripapillary microvasculature, and could potentially help in the differential diagnosis.\n\nCase Report:\nWe present a case of a 26 yo female with bilateral moderate disc edema due to pseudotumor cerebri, for which OCTA showed increased visibility of the papillary and peripapillary microvasculature compared to a control patient of similar age. Interestingly, there also seemed to be increased hyperflow in the markedly engorged retinal vessels in the areas overlapping the optic nerve in comparison to the areas in the peripapillary area. Standard spectral domain OCT showed severe nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickening.\n\nDiscussion:\nOCTA characteristics of papilledema is still not very well-documented in the literature but one study has reported some findings in agreement with ours. Further studies and comparison with OCTA findings in different types of pseudopapilledema such as optic nerve head drusen could open opportunities for a new reliable and inexpensive tool in the differential diagnosis of papilledema.","title":"OCT Angiography Study of Papilledema due to Pseudotumor Cerebri","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175120\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Rim Makhlouf, Michael Maseha\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry, Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Increased VEGF in these conditions is associated with increased blood vessel permeability and endothelial cell proliferation. Anti-VEGF treatments have been proven to ameliorate these effects; however, these treatments may cause detrimental side effects due to VEGF’s role as a survival factor in the retina. Dopamine, through its D2 receptor (D2R), has been shown to inhibit tumor-cell growth by inhibiting VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether dopamine receptor activation suppresses VEGF-induced proliferation of retinal endothelial cells.\n\nMethods:\nHuman retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs; Cell Systems Corp.) were plated at different densities (2,500, 5,000, & 10,000/well) in 96 well plates and incubated for 24h, 48h, or 72h in one of the following conditions: 1) Vehicle, 2) hVEGF (25 ng/ml), 3) Quinpirole (D2R agonist) (1uM), 4) Quinpirole (1uM) + hVEGF (25 ng/ml). At the end of the incubation, cell numbers were estimated using an MTT proliferation assay. Every experimental group contained n=18 from 3 different plates.\n\nResults:\nThe optimal experimental growth condition was 24h incubation of 2,500 cells/well. Under these conditions, hVEGF increased HRMEC proliferation compared to control (142.3 ± 6.3 vs 100, normalized values). Quinpirole by itself did not affect cell number (103.4 ± 5.56 vs 100), but prevented the VEGF induction of proliferation (104.4 ± 7.67 vs 142.3 ± 6.3).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThese results suggest that dopamine type 2 receptor activation can inhibit proliferation mediated by VEGF in human retinal microvasculature endothelial cells in vitro, which may be effective in limiting pathology caused by chronically increased VEGF such as in diabetic retinopathy.","title":"Role of Dopamine Receptors in Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cell Proliferation","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175110\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Allison Gregory, FNU Gerilechaogetu, René Rentería, Lourdes Fortepiani\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Rosenberg School of Optometry UIW, Department of Ophthalmology University of Texas Health, Department of Ophthalmology University of Texas Health, Rosenberg School of Optometry UIW\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study aims to compare the electroretinogram (ERG) and b-wave response amplitudes between control and O3-exposed rats.\n\nMethods:\nDark-adapted luminance-response functions were obtained from groups of age- and sex-matched Long Evans rats (n=16 rats); eight control (clean air) and eight O3-exposed (0.4 ppm for 4 hours/day for 21 days). Full-field ERGs was recorded simultaneously from both eyes in each rat. The scotopic ERG was measured and compared between the two groups. Recordings were performed under general anesthesia (ketamine 70 mg/kg, xylazine 2.5 mg/kg, IP). Pupils were dilated with 2.5% phenylephrine and 1% tropicamide eye drops. The amplitude of the b-wave was measured from the trough of the a-wave or from baseline to the peak of the most positive deflection. The Naka-Rushton equation was used to empirically describe the response amplitude (V) of the b-wave ERG.\n\nResults:\nExperimental data indicates, in the scotopic ERG, a sub-chronic exposure to O3 significantly (p < 0.05) decreased Vmax from 361.2 in the control group to 3.23.6 after an acute O3 exposure. A 7- day O3 exposure further decreased Vmax to 224 (p < 0.05). Amplitudes of the a-wave decreased significantly (p < 0.05) from – 221 mV in the control group to – 145 mV in the 7-day O3-exposed group.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis work demonstrates O3 is a retinal neurotoxin and environmental exposure leads to decreases in the retinal luminance response plus a-wave subnormal amplitudes in the dark-adapted rat retina. Results suggest O3 -exposure contributes to rod system deficits demonstrated by the ERG changes. The current work offers evidence that in sensitive populations living in air-polluted environments, retinal neuron dysfunction may be the result of O3–induced oxidative stress.","title":"Decreases in b-wave and Subnormal a-wave Amplitudes of the Scotopic Electroretinogram after Sub-chronic Exposure to Ozone","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175111\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carlos Garcia, Philip Aitsebaomo, Jordan Wetz\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word, Rosenberg School of Optometry UIW, University of the Incarnate Word\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Few practitioners are integrating low vision rehabilitation strategies into their clinical practices. It is estimated that only 20% of people with low vision are able to access rehabilitation services. This study assessed low vision clinical experiences within one optometry school.\n\nMethods:\nStudent logs were reviewed and analyzed for clinical low vision experiences at NECO and NECO affiliated sites. Student experiences were calculated for graduating classes from 2011-2017.  A low vision clinical experience was defined as providing a comprehensive low vision exam rather than having an observational experience.\n\nResults:\nIn 2011, only 35% of graduates had at least one low vision clinical experience. At this time, NECO had only one full-time low vision faculty member. In 2017, 51% of graduates logged at least one low vision clinical site assignment. This is likely an underestimate due to students having a low vision experience that was not at a low vision identified site. Additionally, NECO has added a low vision component to one of the community health center residency programs. NECO now has three faculty members providing low vision care in a variety of clinical settings. Clinical sites increased from 7 sites in 2011 to 13 sites in 2017 including multiple community health centers.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn order to address the growing need for low vision care across the United States, low vision must remain an active component in an optometric curriculum. Expansion of faculty and increased clinical sites will help to address this need. The expansion of staff and clinical low vision clinics has improved student experience however with the dire need of low vision care the effort must continue across all optometry schools and low vision rehabilitation team members.","title":"Low Vision Clinical Education Experience Expanded Due to Aging Population","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175100\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New England College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Alexis Malkin, Nicole Ross\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New England College of Optometry, New England College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The primary purpose of this study is to determine if a mathematics entrance test and/or midterm examinations can predict the success of first year Optometry students in geometric optics course. The hypothesis is that the students who score below 70% in the mathematics entrance test or midterm examinations, will potentially fail the optics course.\n\nMethods:\nA mathematics entrance test (MET) with multiple-choice questions was administered to 73 first year optometry students. These questions tested the basic concepts in trigonometric and logarithmic functions. Pearson correlation and specificity and sensitivity between the MET, midterms and course performance were calculated.\n\nResults:\nThe results indicated a very weak correlation (r=0.113, p < 0.05) between the MET and the geometric optics course performance. The specificity and sensitivity was 84.5% (CI 73.97% to 92.00%) and 0% (CI  0% to 84.19%) respectively. Correlations between four midterm and final exam were moderate (Midterm I r=0.64, p < 0.05; Midterm II 0.63, p<0.05; Midterm III 0.54, p < 0.05; Midterm IV 0.59, p < 0.05)\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe MET was good in predicting who will pass the geometric optics course but was poor in predicting the failures. It had a poor correlation with the geometric optics final scores. Midterm exams had better correlation with geometric optics final scores than MET. The MET was insufficient to predict the performance in the optics course as it had limited number of questions and other extraneous factors that may have impacted its predictability. Despite moderate correlation, the midterm examinations seem to be a reasonable predictor of student performance in the geometric optics course. However, it was still not a perfect predictor of student performance.","title":"Midterm vs Mathematics Entrance Test: Which Can Predict the Success of First Year Optometry Students in Geometric Optics Course?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175101\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Roger West\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        MCPHS University School of OPtometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This was classified into five categories; Academic Performance (19), Faculty Relations (18), Personal Life Issues (20), Professional Identity (4), Stress in Specific Area of Clinical Optometry (17) . The students rated each of the 78 items (1- Not stressful, 2- Slightly stressful, 3-Moderately stressful, 4- Very stressful, 0-Not experienced yet). The responses were converted to a five-point Likert scale for analysis.\n\nResults:\nThe first and second year student groups had perfect agreement in stress rating among different items. Among the five categories, academic performance was the major stress factor for first and second year students. Both first and second year students rated examinations and grades, fear of failing a course, fear of failing a clinical proficiency exam, lack of time to assigned schoolwork, fear of unable to keep up with the workload and fear of failing the NBEO as stress factors (moderate to very stressful) among academic performance. Testing methods employed by the instructor and lack of communication from the instructor were rated as slight to moderately stressful faculty relation issues. Cost of optometry education, lack of time for relaxation and lack of proper sleep was rated as slight to moderately stressful life issues. Lack of confidence, insecurity concerning professional future and expectation of optometry school vs reality were rated as slight to moderately stressful professional identity issues.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOptometry educators need to address academic stress issues.","title":"Perceived Sources of Stress among First & Second Year Optometry Students","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175102\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Deepti Chittamuru\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Pennsylvania\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Previous studies have shown that blink rate decreases when using a video display terminal. We hypothesized that the blink rate would decrease for a dimly lit screen due to increased visual demand.\n\nMethods:\nVideo of twenty-nine subjects was recorded using the built-in camera of a Macbook Pro (13-inch) 50 cm from the subjects’ eyes. Baseline blink rates were recorded at the beginning of each session. Blink rates were counted for two consecutive five-minute intervals (early, late) while playing the arcade-style game “Titan Attacks” (Puppygames) at either minimum screen illumination (dim) or maximum screen illumination (bright). At a second visit on a separate day, blink rates with the alternate screen setting were observed. Subjects were randomized as to the which screen setting was used first. Statistical analysis was completed using a paired sample T-test.\n\nResults:\nBlink rate was not significantly affected by screen illumination at either time interval. Average blink rate during first five minutes was 6.3 blinks/min (dim) and 6.6 blinks/min (bright), (p < 0.623), and during last five minutes was 6.0 blinks/min (dim) and 6.8 blinks/min (bright), (p< 0.139). Consistent with current literature, blink rate during gameplay was significantly less than baseline blink rate throughout all settings and time intervals (range of p < 1.35x108 to p < 2.66x107). Additionally, blink rate did not change significantly throughout testing intervals (dim: p < 0.634; bright: p < 0.612).\n\n\nConclusion(s):\nBlink rate decreases immediately upon game play and remains relatively constant without significant impact from screen illumination. Future studies could explore the effect of screen illumination on other symptoms such as visual fatigue or sleep quality. Room illumination and other display settings such as contrast and saturation could also be studied.","title":"The Effects of Visual Display Brightness Levels on Blink Rate","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175104\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Charles Le, Ryan Nguyen, John Tran\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Arizona College of Optometry, Arizona College of Optometry, Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Pupil measurements were performed twice in both eyes under photopic lighting conditions and the average was used as the pupil measurement for each eye respectively. A sub-group of 51 individuals had pupil measurements that were performed twice under three additional lighting conditions: scotopic (0 lux), low mesopic (0.3 lux), and high mesopic (3 lux). Sufficient time interval was provided for recovery between measurements. Anisocoria was defined as described previously (Loewenfeld et. al, 1977) as ≥ 0.4 mm difference in mean pupil diameter between eyes.\n\nResults:\nIn all, 23.8% (n=30) exhibited anisocoria in photopic conditions. In the smaller subset of individuals measured under four lighting conditions, anisocoria was present in 27.4% (n=14) in photopic, 43.1% (n=22) in scotopic, 43.1% (n=22) in low mesopic, and 47.1% (n=24) in high mesopic conditions. In this subset, 72.5% (n=37) of the subjects exhibited anisocoria in at least one illumination setting, and 7.8% (n=4) had anisocoria in all illumination settings. The maximum pupil difference between eyes was 1.55 mm.\n\nConclusion(s):\nUsing a cut-off criteria of ≥ 0.4 mm difference between eyes, almost three-quarters of the subjects exhibited anisocoria in at least one illumination setting while a mere 7.8% exhibited anisocoria across all lighting conditions. The results of this study indicate that anisocoria is more prevalent under varied lighting conditions, and the cut-off to identify physiologic anisocoria may need reevaluation.","title":"Evaluation of Physiologic Anisocoria under Various Lighting Conditions","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175105\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Min Kong, Kaydee McCray, Valerie Quan, Pinakin Davey\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Western University of Health Sciences College of Optometry, Western University of Health Sciences College of Optometry, Western University of Health Sciences College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Ravena Jacob","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/effect-of-scald-burn-injury-on-rat-cornea","text":"Abstract\n\nPurpose:\nCorneal epithelial damage frequently occurs in burn patients, including those with chemical and scald burns. We have identified remote effects of scald burn injury including airway obstruction and epithelial shedding in autopsy tissues from burn victims. We have also reported increased airway epithelial lipidperoxidation, 8-OHdG and lipocalin-2 (LCN-2), at 24 h after 60% total body surface area (TBSA) scald burn injury to rats. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may have a role in these adverse effects. We hypothesize that ROS may incite corneal damage in rats with scald burn injury.\n\nThis study examines histologic changes in rat cornea after abdominal scald burn injury. Female Sprague Dawley rats (250g) were divided into sham and burn groups (n = 6/group). The sham group received the same analgesics and fluids as the burn group. At day 5 after 60% TBSA burn the rats were humanely sacrificed and whole eyes were removed and fixed in Davidson's fixative.\n\nMethods:\nAfter processing, eyes were cut to two hemispheres through the iris and optic nerve, using optical nerve as a guide. Both hemispheres were embedded and longitudinal 4 µm sections were used for HE and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitated using ImagePro.\n\nResults:\nMicroscopic evaluation of HE slides showed a significant increase in stromal thickness in burn animals (117 ± 6 µm) compared to sham (93 ± 7 µm, p = 0.04) along with a change in stromal architecture. Quantitative image analysis of IHC slides showed a 4-fold increase in LCN-2 labeling in keratocytes as compared to sham (p = 0.03). There was a 2.5-fold increase in 8-OHdG (p = 0.015) and a 2-fold increase in Caspase-3 (p = 0.031) immunostaining of corneal epithelium in burned rats.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIncreased 8-OHdG and Caspase-3 along with increased LCN-2 and stromal thickness suggest ROS formation and inflammation. Future studies will explore systemic vs local ROS as a mechanism for burn induced corneal injury.","title":"Effect of Scald Burn injury on Rat Cornea","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175106\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        KAREL CAPEK, STEPHAN TROCME, CELESTE FINNERTY, DAVID HERNDON, PERENLEI ENKHBAATAR, HAL HAWKINS, ROBERT COX, PRAVEENA GUPTA\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH-GALVESTON, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH-GALVESTON, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH-GALVESTON, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH-GALVESTON, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH-GALVESTON, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH-GALVESTON, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH-GALVESTON, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH-GALVESTON\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is a potent inducer of EMT in the lens. Recent studies in cancer progression have shown that in addition to activating the canonical Smad signaling pathway, TGFβ can also transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to enhance invasive cell migration. The present study aims to elucidate the involvement of EGFR-signaling in TGFβ-induced EMT in LECs.\n\nMethods:\nLens epithelial explants from 21-day-old Wistar rats were treated with 200 pg/ml TGFβ2 and/or a 2-hour pre-treatment with 100 nM PD153035 (EGFR inhibitor). Expression of β-catenin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), tropomyosin (isoforms 1.6-1.9; CGβ6 antibody) and downstream signaling molecules, including phosphorylated EGFR, Smad proteins and MAPK/ERK1/2 were determined using immunofluorescence and/or western blotting. Cell morphology was examined using phase-contrast microscopy.\n\nResults:\nTreatment with TGFβ2 induced elongation and transdifferentiation of LECs into myofibroblastic cells positive for α-SMA and tropomyosin, with associated activation of Smad2/3, ERK1/2 and EGFR. Pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR-signaling using PD153035 inhibited TGFβ2-induced upregulation of α-SMA and tropomyosin with retention of β-catenin labeling to the cell membrane.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur findings that TGFβ2 transactivates EGFR signaling in LECs reveals a previously unknown mechanism in the pathogenesis of PCO. Understanding the complex interplay between divergent canonical and non-canonical pathways involved in TGFβ-induced EMT will enable the development of more effective targeted therapies in the pharmacological treatment of PCO.","title":"Inhibition of EGFR Signaling is a Novel Approach to Prevention of Posterior Capsular Opacification","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175107\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Frank Lovicu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Sydney\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Considerable research has been done exploring how faculty should deliver effective feedback, with less understanding on how students actually perceive and use this feedback. The purpose of this study was to determine the students’ perceptions on clinical grading at Illinois College of Optometry.\n\nMethods:\nAn anonymous survey was completed by 221 second, third and fourth year optometry students at the Illinois College of Optometry. It asked questions regarding their opinions on the current way that they are evaluated on their clinical performance. There were 14 questions and space to write comments.\n\nResults:\n80% of the students “always” read their evaluations, and 81% feel that the feedback is constructive “most of the time.” 67% of the students said they had written comments on their form “most of the time.” The feedback encourages 53% of them to modify their clinical habits “most of the time.” 79% use Meditrek to track their patient numbers, and 63% use the information to see more patients if they perceive their patient number to be low. 93% of students feel that there is a notable difference in grading between attending doctors. 84% of students feel the clinical evaluation is an accurate representation of how they performed “most of the time.”\n\nConclusion(s):\nOverall students found a value in written evaluations which helped most students modify their clinical behavior and track patient numbers. Students noted a distinct discrepancy between various attending doctors and strongly argued for a better way of standardizing expectations and creating more equality in the grading process. Our study findings will help faculty understand how students value evaluations, how they use it to amend their behaviors and skills, and ultimately may assist in shaping how faculty provide evaluation.","title":"Students’ Perceptions of Clinical Grading","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175089\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Anne Rozwat\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

In Class Year A, 16 such objectives were identified and then assigned by stratified random sampling to Intervention (8 obj.) or Control (8 obj.) for the coming class year. The written exam questions of participating Year-A students were individually reviewed using content analysis to identify and classify student errors for the 8 behavioral objectives assigned to intervention. Then for Class Year B, formative assessment exercises were added to address the 8 Intervention objectives. Students were given problems in class to work on together, and the instructor provided feedback and identified common mistakes. The exam results of students in Class Year B were assessed. Of the 16 objectives originally identified, 4 Intervention objectives and 5 Control objectives happened to be tested in both Class Years A & B, and these were used for statistical analysis.\n\nResults:\nIn Class Year A (41 participants), the mean scores on Intervention and Control objectives were 67.7% & 57.2%. After targeted formative assessment in Class Year B (48 participants), the mean scores on Intervention and Control objectives were 73.5% & 70.8%. There was not a significant improvement on Intervention objectives in comparison to Control objectives (t = 1.82, p = 0.07).\n\nConclusion(s):\nTargeting difficult topics in this study provided no significant improvements in student learning. Previous research shows a strong positive effect of formative assessment on learning, so perhaps the particular formative exercises adopted in this study were not optimal.","title":"Course Evaluation and Revision: Using Test Results and Formative Assessment to Improve Future Teaching and Learning for Difficult Topics","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175091\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern California College of Optometry-SCCO\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The distribution of the themes was compared between students as were the leadership domains (Executing, Influencing, Relationship Building, Strategic Thinking). An invitation to participate and general informed consent was sent to 172 incoming optometry students. There were 118 completed consent forms from this initial survey. A total of 74 students completed the formal consent and full assessment (43% of incoming class; 63% of those who were sent a code). The sample was 76% female.\n\nResults:\nThe top four Signature Themes were: Learner, Achiever, Developer, and Restorative. Tied for fifth were Harmony and Responsibility. The remaining top ten themes were Input, Empathy, Positivity and Relator. Learner was the most likely to be an optometry student’s top theme. Of the top ten themes, most fall under the leadership domain of Relationship Building. None of the top ten themes in this cohort fell under the category of Influencing.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn a professional setting, StrengthsQuest may allow consideration of how students’ talents align with the evolving practice of optometry. Insights could be gained into recruitment, admissions, career opportunities and preferences in professional roles and responsibilities. The themes displayed commonly in optometry students are similar to those noted in a 2015 study of pharmacy students. Knowledge of Signature Theme distribution among optometry students could assist the academy in preparing optometrists to best engage in the profession. Further assessment of talent themes in relation to academic program success and ultimately, satisfaction with optometric practice, may prove useful.","title":"Strengths Assessment in First Year Optometry Students","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175092\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

DISC results are linked to 1 of 60 descriptive graphs, each with a unique plot location in one of 8 sectors (Conductor-Persuader-Promoter-Relater-Supporter-Coordinator-Analyzer-Implementer) on the TTI Success Wheel® (Wheel). 704 Southern College of Optometry (SCO) student DISC profiles (N=704; 276 males; 428 females) were compared to corresponding values in the US population derived from a 2013 survey (N=177,979) using a one-sample hypothesis test of proportions against the known population value. Natural DISC summary scores of the SCO sample for Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Compliance were also compared to a 2012 US population sample (N=10,667 males; N=7,134 females) by gender using independent-samples t-tests.\n\nResults:\nDifferences were found on 20 of the 60 possible plot values (p < .05) which corresponded to differences on 7 of 8 Wheel sectors.

Opinions from first-line providers, including optometry, are generally in support of vision screening programs, however, the opinions of health professional learners are not known, and may affect the establishment of future vision screening programs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the opinions and attitudes of third year optometry learners towards pediatric vision screenings before and after participating in a vision screening program.\n\nMethods:\nA combination of two validated surveys was given to learners before and after participating in a local pediatric vision screening. The survey included questions regarding pediatric eye care, teamwork, attitude and preparedness.\n\nResults:\n61% of pre-screening and 63% of post-screening surveys were completed. The majority of learners (>90% pre and post) had good knowledge about pediatric eye disease and the appropriate tests required to diagnose these conditions. Learners’ perspective of which age-group of children would benefit most from screenings (older pre, younger post) and whether screenings were worth the cost (78% yes pre, 86% yes post) had changed post-screening. Learners were mixed about whether vision screening programs should be independent (44% pre, 31% post) or combined with other screenings such as hearing or dental (35% pre, 50% post). Overall, screening participation increased learners’ confidence (76% pre, 91% post) and preparedness (85% pre, 88% post) in working with children, and their willingness (54% pre, 74% post) to play larger roles in future screenings.\n\nConclusion(s):\nParticipation in a pediatric vision screening enhanced learner’s attitudes towards such programs, and their willingness to participate in future screenings.","title":"Evaluating Optometry Learner’s Attitudes towards Pediatric Vision Screening","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175094\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo, Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Wylie Tan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence Among Health Care Professionals – Student Version (IAPCC-SV) survey was designed to measure cultural competency in health care students by evaluating five cultural domains: awareness, skill, knowledge, encounters and desire. This survey also assesses if a student is practicing at a level of cultural proficiency, cultural competence, cultural awareness or cultural incompetence; a higher score means a higher level of cultural competence. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the cultural competency of students at the University of Waterloo School of Optometry and Vision Science (WOVS) and the effect of an educational intervention on their level of cultural competency.\n\nMethods:\nThe IAPCC-SV survey was given to a sample of fourth-year optometry students. Following this, all participants attended a didactic lecture which discussed the basics of diversity training and their application in an optometric setting. A second survey was completed by the students two months after the lecture to determine if the training session had any influence on students’ approach to clinical care and their position on the cultural competency spectrum.\n\nResults:\nOf the thirty-two participants, 29 completed the survey in full. Prior to attending the lecture, 48% of students were categorized as being culturally aware and 52% were deemed to be culturally competent.

Self reported demographic questionnaire and the NEI-VFQ-25 were administered.\n\nResults:\nThe average age was 44.2 ± 13.2 years old. Gender distribution among the sample was 70.2% females and 29.8% males. Demographic data revealed an income less than $25,000 (60.3%), married as social status was (59.5%) and bachelor’s degree educational level (28.2%). The overall internal consistency and validity of the Spanish VFQ-25 was 0.93. Only the role limitation subscale revealed a low reliability. No difference was found between age and NEI-VFQ-25 subscales. Females revealed difficulties with driving (128.8±22.7), distance vision (99.4 ±36.6), and role limitations (123.7±34.3) when compared with males. Social status demonstrated divorced participants perceived more ocular pain (112.5±19.4) and married participants reported difficulties with general vision (66.9±22.6). For education level, participants with some college credits reported having difficulties with driving (121.4±20.0), near vision (141.7±64.5), general vision (47.7±30.5), peripheral vision (75.0±31.6), less wellbeing (203.4 ±109.8) and more social limitations (81.8±25.2).\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur study revealed that gender, marital status, and educational background were proven to influence the scores on the VFQ-25. The results suggest that VFQ-25 has validity as a measure of visual function and QOL in the population studied. Further studies are needed to re-evaluate the subscale of role limitations and to understand the causes of perceived visual function and QOL of the Puerto Rican population.","title":"Self-Reported Visual Function and Quality of Life in a Clinic Population from Puerto Rico","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175096\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Inter American University of Puerto Rico\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Melissa Marques\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Private Practitioner\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Height, weight, and blood pressure measurement were obtained. Self reported questionnaire about nutritional habits, health-related lifestyle, and depression (Becks Depression Inventory) were used. All measurements and questionnaires were administered within the first and last month of the academic year.\n\nResults:\nThe average sample age was 25.2 ± 3.2 years old. BMI for the sample was higher at the end of the semester for both years; 25.5 ± 5.0 and 25.9 ± 4.4, respectively. Most students were in the overweight range. Systolic blood pressure at the end of both years was 105.2 ± 11.3 and 110.7 ± 10.5 mmHg, respectively. Diastolic blood pressure was 69.7 ± 9.19 and 73.8 ± 8.1 mmHg, showing higher blood pressure at the end of second year.  Nutritional habits revealed a decreased frequency of three-meal consumption at the end of both years. Health-related lifestyle revealed increased alcohol consumption (71.9% and 81.3%), a decrease in exercise (95.7% and 88.0%), and sleep patterns, average of 4 to 6 hours daily (81.3% to 50.0%), at the end of both years respectively. No differences in regards to cigarette smoking (3.1% years one and two) and dinning out 1 to 2 times a week (78.9% and 71.4%). Depression inventory was 2.51 ± 3.0 for year one and 4.5 ± 5.1 for year two, which revealed normal mood fluctuation.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur study revealed most of the students were overweight. The reduced meal intake, sleep patterns and increased alcohol consumption were observed at the end of the semester, demonstrates the importance to develop student support programs in order to encourage healthier nutrition and overall lifestyle.","title":"Eating Habits and Health Status among Optometric Students: Phase II","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175097\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Inter American University of Puerto Rico\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Karen Gil\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Inter American University of Puerto Rico School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

VaKE engages learners in authentic learning activities using a dilemma. This project compared the effectiveness of VaKE, as assessed by experienced clinicians vs. second year optometry students with no clinical experience in optometry.\n\nMethods\n: Two pilots were conducted. The first pilot was conducted on 62, second year optometry student participants (BSc-Optom) who had no prior clinical experience. The second pilot was conducted on 15 Masters of optometry student participants (MSc-Optom), who were professional optometrists with previous clinical experience. A 20 Linkert Scale questionnaire was used to evaluate the students’ judgment of the significance of their VaKE experience. The results of the two pilots were then compared.\n\nResults\n: The VaKE pilot was similarly evaluated by the two groups of participants as one that increased their self-awareness during clinical decision making, and an overall interesting experience, without statistically significant differences. There was one question that showed a statistical significant difference (.01< p <.05), the BSc-Optom group found the VaKE process significantly more efficient in preparing them for future clinical practice.\n\nConclusions\n: The VaKE pedagogical technique was deemed equally valuable to all participants, regardless of their professional experience. Introducing VaKE earlier during optometry education may prove more effective in self-awareness during future clinical decision making.","title":"The Effect of Clinical Experience on the Assessment of VaKE (Values and Knowledge Education)","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175099\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ariela Gordon-Shaag, Rachel Eichler\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Deptartment of Optometry Hadassah Academic College, Deptartment of Optometry Hadassah Academic College\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

These skills are divided into 10 practicals. The Binocular Indirect Ophthalmoscopy practical requires students to obtain 8 peripheral fundus views and the posterior pole in 8 minutes. During the prior 3 years, BIO consistently had the lowest initial pass rate of all skills tested.\n\nMethods:\nTo better prepare students for the BIO practical, teaching faculty prepared a voluntary pilot practice session having each student bring one patient. The student would begin the “mock practical” by first examining their own patient with preceptors observing at least ½ of their views. The students then rotate to the other patients (akin to “speed dating”) in 8 minute intervals until they examine 3 additional patients. This process allowed each student exposure to multiple patients during the practice session.\n\nResults:\nTo assess student perceptions about the value of this pilot practice technique, an anonymous Likert survey with 2 statements was performed immediately following the practice session. The students were overwhelming in favor of this practice technique (96.2% and 93.4%) based on their responses to the survey. 88.3% of participating pilot practice students completed the survey.\n\nA retrospective review of BIO initial practical pass rates was done for the prior 3 years revealed an average pass rate of 61.3%. The pass rate for the class with the pilot practice session increased dramatically to 77% on initial BIO testing - the highest pass rate on the BIO skill during any of the prior 4 years.\n\nConclusion(s):\nGiven the positive student perceptions of the pilot BIO practice session as well as the dramatic increase in actual practical pass rates for this skill, the teaching faculty of the CS course at PCO plan to integrate this practice modality into future course methodology.","title":"Pilot BIO Practice Session Using Multiple Shared Patients Improves Practical Pass Rate","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175085\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Optometry students coping mechanisms to stress is largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the stress coping strategies of first and second year Doctor of optometry students.\n\nMethods:\nA survey was administered to first year (mean age 24.5\n+\n2.7 years) and second year (mean age 24.8\n+\n2.6 years) students. The response rate was 61% (First: 41, Second: 41 students responded). They were asked to rate their stress on 100-point scale (100 -very stressful; 0 -no stress) and answer what they do to overcome stress. The means and standard deviation for the stress rating was calculated. Their coping responses were classified into adaptive (positive) and maladaptive (negative) coping strategy.\n\nResults:\nThe mean stress rating score for first year 70.1\n+\n25.8 and second year 79.1\n+\n15.6 was not significantly different (t-test: p=0.06). Of the 166 coping responses from 82 students, the majority (95%) adopted an adaptive copying strategies including active coping, emotional support, planning, religion and recreation. About 5% adopted maladaptive coping such as turning to alcohol, drugs, denial, venting, behavioral and mental disengagement.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe majority of the surveyed first and second year optometry students surveyed exhibited an adaptive coping strategy to stress. Adaptive coping, addresses the short-term stress and has longer term positive consequences. They represent a healthy way of dealing with stress. A small percentage adopted maladaptive coping which addresses short term stress but may lead to long term negative overall effects.","title":"Stress Coping Strategies of First & Second Year Optometry Students","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175087\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        MCPHS College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Shankaran Ramaswamy\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry MCPHS University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

At SUNY,student clinical performance is assessed in three areas including Patient Care, Interpersonal and Communication Skills, and Professionalism utilizing a scale of Outstanding, Competent, Minimally Competent or Unsatisfactory. We have recognized that those who do not consistently reach Competency standards during their 3rd year in any or all of these areas struggle to successfully complete their 4th year rotations. Previous remediation efforts were deemed unsatisfactory in achieving our desired outcomes.\n\nMethods:\nA structured clinical remediation program was developed to be initiated upon identification of deficiency(ies) and customized to address specific deficits. It utilizes a cadre of clinical remediation coaches paired with interns who earned less than Competency in any or all of the three areas assessed during their first clinical term. The remediation coaches were provided with resources on best practices in remediation, given prior feedback summaries/specifics on areas of deficiency with guidance for interventional opportunities and given time in their schedule to meet with their interns.\n\nResults:\n7 of 13 interns (54%) enrolled in the structured remediation program vs. 2 of 12 interns (17%) without a structured program in the previous academic year were able to achieve Competency levels or better in all areas at the end of their 3rd year. The depth, number and etiology of deficiencies and the attitudes of the intern were significant contributors to the outcomes.\n\nConclusion(s):\nTimely application of a customized, structured intervention program that was appropriately resourced resulted in significantly greater numbers of interns achieving clinical Competency at the end of their 3rd year.","title":"Analysis of a New Structured, Customized and Timely Clinical Remediation Program at the SUNY College of Optometry","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175088\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Richard Madonna, Harriette Canellos, Patricia Modica, David Troilo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry, SUNY College of Optometry, SUNY College of Optometry, SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study aims to determine the factors that motivate NECO students to select a specific elective course prior to, during, and after it is offered (OD3 year). Elective programs at other schools will be investigated for comparison.\n\nMethods:\nSurveys were distributed to OD2, OD3, and OD4/2016 graduates(OD4) at NECO. The OD2 will likely not have investigated the elective program. The OD3 and OD4 report what factors affected their selection and course feedback. The later survey will also assess if they would choose differently, in retrospect. Externally surveys were distributed to all Academic Deans to determine the details of their elective programs.\n\nResults:\nSurvey responses were received from OD2 (n=68), OD3 (n=77), and OD4 (n=62). Most other schools provided information about their programs (n=21). OD2 students are “very interested” in anterior (62%) and posterior segment disease (56%) and practice management (50%), but “Not Interested” in research (82%), public speaking (57%), or basic science (50%). 84% believe electives will be a valuable component to their education and plan to select based on topic, workload, and format. OD3 and OD4 rate electives as valuable (75% and 81%, respectively) and both selected based on topic, format and credit hours. OD4 students would not have selected differently. Externally 15/21 schools (71%) offer elective courses in OD1-OD3 years, with the majority being didactic-style during the OD3 year. Eight schools require electives as part of the curriculum, while they are optional at 7.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe majority of NECO students surveyed rate elective programs to be a valuable component of their education and select courses based on topic. They are least concerned with peer-review, grading format, or term offered. While programs vary by school only one third require elective courses.","title":"Student Attitudes Towards Elective Courses in Optometric Education","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175079\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Korb & Associates\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The School entered into a license agreement with ExamSoft in 2015 in part to enhance the program’s assessment. Faculty involvement strategy, and core curriculum test items comparison for two consecutive academic years (AY) will be presented.\n\nMethods:\nA comparative analysis of total number of items, items tagged to program student learning outcomes (SLO’s), and items tagged to faculty programmed individual course learning outcomes (CLO’s) for the two academic years between August 2015 and May 2017 was performed.\n\nResults:\nAfter initial training, the School’s platform administrator entered the program’s SLO’s, cognitive styles, and NBEO categories in ExamSoft for faculty to tag questions. The faculty entered their CLO’s. Of the 27 core-curriculum courses 25 had CLO’s entered as of May 2017. Of the 24 SLO’s 22 can be measured directly or indirectly; all 22 had test items: range 3 – 687 items in 2015-16, and 3 – 707 items in 2016-17. For the 2015-16 AY 135 exams used 3437 items, while 146 exams used 4303 items in 2016-17. For the 2015-16 AY 2356 (68.5%) items were tagged with SLO’s and 2327 (54.1%) in the 2016-17 AY. For the 2015-16 AY 3015 (87.8%) items were tagged with CLO’s, and 3812 (88.5%) in 2016-17. The total questions database as of May 2017 was 6908.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIAUPRSO used a bottom up implementation strategy to encourage faculty involvement in order to ensure that the platform was widely used and all questions be appropriately tagged. CLO’s were more frequently used when compared to SLO’s. Preliminary data was presented to the faculty in August 2016 to encourage wider participation and more consistent use of SLO’s. Our next step is to reach 100% faculty participation and better compliance tagging items according to CLO’s, SLO’s, and, ultimately, implement use of NBEO categories to identify possible gaps in the curriculum.","title":"Computer-based Testing Assessment at the Inter American University School of Optometry: Two Years Comparison","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175080\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Interamerican University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Caroline Faucher","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/clinical-reasoning-promoting-early-clinical-problem-representation-with-an-interactive-script-concordance-in-class-session","text":"Abstract\n\nIntroduction:\nEarly problem representation is essential to clinical reasoning. Problem representation constitutes an intermediate step between data acquisition and hypothesis generation. It helps to understand the problem and to direct knowledge retrieval toward relevant diagnoses. Because clinical reasoning is anchored in practice, promoting students’ early problem representation in the classroom is challenging. The aim of this educational case report was to design and implement a simple learning activity promoting early problem representation when limited data is available. The script theory served as a foundation for this novel activity.\n\nCase Report:\nThe \"interactive script concordance in-class session\" took place in a 46 first-year optometry student class. Incomplete information about a clinical scenario was provided. Students consulted each other to make hypotheses, and then shared them with the class. A new clinical finding was then given. The students had to evaluate, as in a script concordance test, the effect of this new finding on their initial hypothesis (more or less likely, or no effect). Classroom discussions resulted in the generation of working hypotheses and in the determination of further clinical data to be gathered in order to confirm them. Students’ satisfaction was assessed through an anonymous survey. The interactive script concordance in-class session helped students understand how optometrists analyze clinical data. Respondents were strongly in favor of repeating this activity during their studies.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOptometry students need support to develop their ability to form a problem representation. Interactive script concordance in-class sessions foster early hypothesis generation when limited information is available. They are easy to prepare, are suitable to large classes, while arousing great interest. The experience being positive, the interactive script concordance in-class session will be included in other optometry courses.","title":"Clinical Reasoning: Promoting Early Clinical Problem Representation with an Interactive Script Concordance In-Class Session","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175081\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Montreal School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient experience of supervised optometry student consultations.\n\nMethods:\nA survey, comprising 42 closed and 3 open questions, was mailed to consecutive adult patients who received a comprehensive eye examination in teaching and non-teaching clinics at the Australian College of Optometry (Melbourne, Australia) over a 4-week period.\n\nResults:\nResponses were received from 193 patients who had a student involved in their care (44% response rate; 156 completed correctly) and 177 who did not have a student involved (32% response rate; 105 completed correctly). There was no significant difference in overall patient satisfaction between the teaching and non-teaching clinics (\nP\n=0.18). Over 87% of patients in the teaching clinic felt completely comfortable with a student examining them, 44% felt their care was better as a student was involved and 97% rated the student’s overall performance as very good or good. Although 12% would rather have seen an optometrist only and 3% would prefer not to have a student involved in further care, 100% believed it important for students to work with patients. The most common reason for accepting the role of the student was the importance of providing opportunities to learn. The main reasons for an unwillingness to have a student involved in future were the extra time taken and prolonged testing.\n\nConclusion\n:\nThese findings suggest that most patients view supervised student optometric care delivery as an important and highly positive experience. However, efforts should be made to avoid excessively long consultations and prolonged testing. Any concerns for patient satisfaction and acceptance are largely unwarranted and should not prevent optometry students being involved in patient care.","title":"The Patient Experience During Supervised Student Optometry Care","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175082\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Deakin University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jane Trevaskis, Daryl Guest, Kathleen Watt, Sharon Bentley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Australian College of Optometry, University of Melbourne, University of New South Wales, Australian College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The results show that a high percentage of students perceive the use of these tools as positive and supportive of the teaching-learning process; allowing them, among other things, collaborative learning and communication in a more relaxed environment.\n\nCase report:\nCourse: Neuro Optometric Rehabilitation I\n\n\nDiscussion:\nWith the intention to explore the use of online resources in improving learning by fostering student engagement through collaborative learning, a Facebook group was created to be used as an adjunct didactic resource. This tool allows the faculty to monitor in real time the student’s active participation. Case discussions, open ended questions and multiple choice questions were used. Student participation in the group and completion of the exit survey was optional. At the end of the course a Likert scale survey was sent to students to complete. 76% of the students agreed/strongly agreed that the use of online resources used enhanced their learning. 67% of the students agreed/strongly agreed that the use of online resources and their content enhance their learning. 69% of the students agreed/strongly agreed that the course expanded their concept of how the use of online resources can improve their learning.\n\nConclusion:\nIt’s a reality that the way students learn today has changed.\n\nFaculty needs to adapt and find new ways to stablish better communication channels to keep students engaged while making them play an active role in their learning.

The Reducing Adenoviral Patient-Infected Days (RAPID) study is a randomized trial assessing the efficacy of 5% Betadine for the treatment of adenoviral conjunctivitis.\n\nCase Report:\nPrincipal investigators of 9 clinics- private and state colleges, medical schools, a military hospital and an Indian Health Services center- completed a survey to document their IRB approval process. Time (weeks) from initial submission to receive an initial IRB response was 1-2 (33%), 3 (33%), 4 (22%) and 8 (11%) and was longer for paper-only IRB’s (31 days) than electronic IRB submissions (21 days). Time (weeks) for full IRB approval was 3 (13%), 4 (13%), 8 (38%) and more than 12 (38%). The average number of resubmissions required was 4 (range 1-12). Required training of clinic personnel for IRB approval included: Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (87.5%), other institution-specific online courses (62.5%) and biosafety/environmental health & safety (12.5%). Strategies that facilitated IRB approval included consulting with IRB staff/committee members (44%), having a mentor (44%) and complying with institutional deadlines (78%).\n\nConclusion(s):\nTimely IRB approval is a hurdle for all investigators. Many institutions require additional ethics and safety training before protocols can be approved. Consultation with IRB staff or committee members prior to submission can reduce wasted time and effort. A central IRB for multi-center studies could provide uniform review and expedite research.\n\nThe IRB application process is unique to each clinic, requires considerably more preparation than simply submitting a protocol and can cause a significant delay in study start-up.","title":"Navigating Institutional Review Boards for a Multi-center Clinical Trial: The RAPID Study Group Experience","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175084\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Meredith Whiteside, Mary Migneco, Andrew Hartwick, Spencer Johnson, Jennifer Harthan, Christina Morettin, Julie Huecker, Christian Olson, Tammy Than, Mae Gordon\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California School of Optometry Berkeley CA, Washington University in St. Louis St. Louis MO, Ohio State University Columbus OH, Northeastern State University Tahlequah OK, Illinois College of Optometry Chicago IL, Illinois College of Optometry Chicago IL, Washington University in St. Louis St. Louis MO, Brooke Army Medical Center San Antonio TX, University of Alabama Birmingham Birmingham AL, Washington University in St. Louis St. Louis MO\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Presenting symptoms include sudden vision loss, pain with ocular movement, and dyschromatopsia. Immediate workup is indicated to preserve vision and rule out life threatening conditions. This case report details an unique etiology of optic neuritis: non-tuberculous mycobacterium infection following a dental procedure.\n\nCase report:\nA seven year old, African-American, immunocompetent male presented for a routine eye exam at a school based clinic. His medical history was significant for left submandibular lymphadenitis secondary to exposure to contaminated water during a root canal. Lymph node biopsy had confirmed the presence of mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex. The patient underwent lymphadenectomy and antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to presentation. Best corrected visual acuities at distance were 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. An afferent pupillary defect was present OS. Dilated fundus examination, optical coherence tomography, and oral fluorescein revealed optic nerve edema with peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy OS. Upon diagnosis of optic neuritis OS, a compressive lesion or intracranial abscess was ruled out by magnetic resonance imaging. Laboratory results were negative for bartonella, tuberculosis mycobacterium, and syphilis. Given the resolving nature of the inflammation, vitreous biopsy was not performed. Observation was elected without steroid treatment due to the recent history of mycobacterium infection.\n\nConclusion(s):\nTreatment of optic neuritis is dependent on the underlying systemic cause. A non-tuberculous mycobacterium infection is treated with antimicrobial therapy and surgical excision as indicated.

Despite a higher prevalence in females, CVST remains a differential for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in males and warrants imaging.\n\nCase Report:\nA 72 yo AAM presented for exam. Pertinent history included multiple bony dehiscences, spontaneous CSF leak s/p repair, subdural hematoma, s/p thyroid and prostate cancer, hypertension, and melanocytoma OD. BCVA was 20/30 OD, OS. Pertinent exam findings included 1.2 log APD OD and visual field defects OU. Blood pressure was 240/150 mmHg. Fundus evaluation revealed significant bilateral edema consistent with PE and no evidence of hypertensive retinopathy. Emergent referral to the hospital was made. His blood pressure was normalized and a MRI/MRA/MRV/LP were performed. Testing revealed CVST and elevated opening pressure. An angioplasty and stent procedure was performed thus, resolving disc edema.\n\nDiscussion:\nPE exclusively terms optic nerve edema in the context of elevated ICP. With complicated history, our patient had many differentials for disc edema including CSF leak and stage 4 hypertensive retinopathy. However, CSF leak would not cause elevated ICP, although it may be a result of it, and other signs of retinopathy were absent. A patient with this presentation warrants emergent work up which should include not only BP control but also neuroimaging otherwise, a CVST could have been missed.\n\nConclusion(s):\nDue to a wide range of manifestations, increased ICP may have a delayed diagnosis; however, ODs are equipped to recognize these. Astute clinicians utilize a thorough health history and knowledge of neuroanatomy to ascertain differentials which should include CVST. It is crucial to look beyond when findings do not match a clinical picture. Emergent referral and neuroimaging can help reduce morbidity/mortality.","title":"One of These Things is Not Like the Others: Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Causing Papilledema in a Patient with Uncontrolled Hypertension and Previous History of Spontaneous CSF Leaks","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175076\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Erin Draper, Ashley Maglione\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Presented are two cases of bilateral enophthalmos due to metastatic breast cancer. Unlike many space occupying tumors which cause proptosis, infiltrative breast cancer metastasis can cause enophthalmos due to contraction of the orbital contents. These present patients’ cases are atypical because they are bilateral in presentation. Furthermore the first patient’s orbital metastasis was identified in close temporal proximity to the primary diagnosis of breast cancer and the enophthalmos was the presenting sign of breast cancer in the other case.\n\nCase Report:\nPatient one is a 55 year old african american female who presented to the eye clinic due to eyelid tightening. On examination she had tight and firm eyelids and restriction of multiple extraocular muscles on both sides. She had bilateral enophthalmos and had been diagnosed with breast cancer 3 months prior to her ocular examination. A right orbitotomy biopsy was performed and the diagnosis of breast cancer was confirmed.\n\nPatient two is a 84 year old african american female who presented with the chief complaint of swollen eyelids which were refractory to steroid treatment. She again had bilateral firm eyelids and her orbital fat was firm as well. Extraocular examination revealed restriction of both eyes in multiple angles of gaze although the patient denied diplopia. A right orbitotomy was performed and anterior chest wall lesions were also biopsied. The pathology examination revealed metastatic breast cancer although she had not been diagnosed with breast cancer previously.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThese two patients are important to review and identify as their symptoms and signs could have been overlooked or misdiagnosed. Enopthalmos and orbital scarring due to cancer metastasis may be more subtle in presentation causing Eyelid tightening, diminished palpebral fissure, and diplopia. As seen in patient two orbital metastasis may be the initial presenting sign of breast cancer so should be considered a differential in patients with these symptoms.","title":"Bilateral Orbital Metastasis of Breast Cancer","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175077\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Emory University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Aided distance visual acuity was reduced at 20/50+ OD and 20/40- OS. Pupillary function, extraocular muscle function, and confrontation fields were within normal limits. Anterior and posterior ocular health were unremarkable. Threshold visual field testing revealed an asymmetric, incomplete binasal visual field defect.

Documented ocular causes include individual cases of ischemic optic neuropathy, optic nerve drusen, glaucoma, optic nerve pits, retinitis pigmentosa, and keratoconus. Documented intracranial causes include a case of congenital hydrocephalus, atherosclerosis of the internal carotid artery, and pituitary adenoma. The pathophysiology of binasal hemianopsia, while not well understood, is hypothesized to be associated with damage caused by increased intracranial pressure and/or compression from adjacent arteries such as the internal carotid or anterior cerebral caused by shifting from nearby intracranial tumors.","title":"Binasal Hemianopsia: A Clinical Anomaly","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175068\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Morgan Ollinger\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Michigan College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

PML is characterized by progressive areas of localized white matter damage secondary to viral etiology and not due to a structural abnormality. Presenting symptoms usually include dysphasia, confusion, hemiparesis, apathy and immobility, field defects, blindness, and transient visual obscurations. The diagnosis of PML is made based on the clinical findings including neuroimaging, blood analysis, lumbar puncture, and brain biopsy.\n\nCase Report:\nA 37 year old African American male presented to clinic with concerns of acute, transient blurred vision of the right eye and peripheral paresis for two months. He denied headaches, pain, photopsia, or other associated symptoms. Medical and ocular histories were unremarkable. Unaided acuities were 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Normal pupillary, biomicroscopy, and funduscopy OU. Humphrey visual field (24-2) showed a right superior homonymous quadrantanopia. Due to the clinical findings and symptoms, the patient was referred out for advanced testing. An MRI of the brain and orbits was ordered and revealed multiple, hyper-reflective white lesions of the brain with gadolinium enhancement within aspects of the left temporal and occipital lobes. Blood analysis revealed a CD4 count of 17 cells/mm3, elevated viral load, and a positive enzyme immunoassay test all of which confirming the presence of HIV. Lumbar puncture detected the JC virus. Hospitalized was followed and anti-retroviral therapy was initiated.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe sudden onset of acute, progressive transient visual obscurations, visual field defects, and decreased vision should alert a suspicion of possible neurological pathology.

ADEM is typically pediatric and usually preceded by a viral or bacterial infection or vaccination and generally occurs once. The inflammation can attack the myelin of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. ADEM can be difficult to distinguish from multiple sclerosis (MS). MRI is the mainstay of diagnosing ADEM. ADEM lesions will generally resolve, but there is a 20% chance for development of MS.\n\nCase Report:\nA 24-year-old Caucasian male presented for a binocular vision evaluation with Neuro-Optometry after experiencing a mild traumatic brain injury secondary to an airborne jump incident. On examination, a 1+ left APD was detected along with 1+ asymmetric optic disc pallor. A temporal pallor wedge OD and diffuse pallor OS was observed. Vision (20/20 OD, OS), color vision, and 24-2-5 FDT VF were unremarkable. At follow-up, pupillometry and OCT ONH and RNFL OU confirmed both APD and optic atrophy. HVF 30-2 SITA Standard revealed faint scattered nasal defects OD and scattered diffuse defects OS. MRI of the brain and orbits was unremarkable. Lab testing was also ordered to rule out etiology that may result in optic atrophy. The patient later revealed a previous diagnosis of ADEM secondary to viral meningitis as a child, with transient monocular vision loss. After consultation with neurology, monitoring at six month intervals with MRI and HVF was recommended to rule out progression to MS.\n\nConclusion(s):\nADEM is a rare disease that can have a lasting effect on vision, generally occurring in the pediatric population. Recurrences have been reported to occur in a third of ADEM patients and are likely to be more severe in adults; although currently no diagnostic criteria for the adult population exists. This case report highlights the importance of close evaluation and monitoring of the patient in order to promote early detection of relapse or progression to MS.","title":"Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis: An Atypical Demyelinating Disease","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175070\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Symptoms are usually a result of increased intracranial pressure and include: headache, nausea, and mental changes.\n\nCase Report:\n35yo female presented to the eye clinic for a routine eye exam. She had a positive history of breast cancer, for which she was on chemotherapy. She reported that she was “feeling good” and she noted no change in vision since her last appointment and was interested in an updated glasses prescription. Entering visual acuities were 20/20 OD, OS, OU. Normal EOMS, pupils, and CVF. Fundus examination showed 1+ diffuse edema of the optic nerves OD>OS. An OCT ONH showed bilateral elevation of 141um OD, and 177um OS. Her HVF showed mild superior and inferior depression OU (MD: -5.31db OD, -4.04dB OS. Although the patient reported no change in vision or headaches, with the known history of Breast cancer, an MRI was ordered. Right temporal and parietal and left parietal lobe enhancing lesions (total of 3 lesions) were found. The diagnosis was presumed leptomeningeal secondary to metastases from patient's known breast carcinoma.\n\nDiscussion:\nLeptomeningeal Carcinoma is a rare complication of cancer and occurs when the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord become affected. Breast and lung cancer, as well as melanoma are the cancers most frequently found to metastasize in this manner. If left untreated, progressive neurologic dysfunction causes death at median time of 4-6 weeks. Radiation therapy and intrathecal chemotherapy can increase the median survival to 3-6 months.\n\nConclusion(s):\nComprehensive Dilated Eye exams are important for all patients, including those who appear to have good visual function. A baseline examination prior to the start of chemotherapy may be indicated for these patients, in addition to serial examinations. Co-management with hematology/oncology is critical for patient care.","title":"Leptomeningeal Carcinoma Found on Routine Eye Exam","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175071\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kelli Shaon, Raneat Cohen\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Mason Eye Institute, Mason Eye Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Currently, there is limited evidence describing the appropriate diagnostic algorithm and its yield in the workup of optic atrophy. The goals of this study is to report the etiologies of optic atrophy in an inner city, primarily a Hispanic and African American community, and to describe the utility of diagnostic testing in the evaluation of isolated optic atrophy.\n\nMethods:\nA retrospective chart review of all patients with a diagnosis of optic atrophy seen in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center between January 2011 and November 2016. All patients were assessed for an etiologic diagnosis of optic atrophy by a comprehensive neuro-ophthalmologic eye exam as well as laboratory testing and neuroimaging.\n\nResults:\n106 patients met inclusion criteria of the 193 reviewed charts. Our study population included 49.1% African Americans and 30.2% Hispanics. The results of our study indicate that the most common etiology of optic atrophy in this population was idiopathic in 33.0% of patients (N= 35), and this was regardless of race, followed by compressive in 14.1% (N=15) and ischemic in 13.2% (N=14). Our study also found that 29.2 % (N=31) had a determination of etiology based on neuroimaging, while only 11.3 % (N=12) had a diagnosis made by laboratory studies. Ultimately, of the 49 patients without a previously known etiology, neuroimaging was of highest yield and diagnostic in 18.4% of patients compared to 4% by laboratory studies.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOn the basis of our results, a “shotgun” approach of laboratory testing is of low diagnostic yield in the determination of the etiology of optic atrophy, and only directed labs are recommended. Neuroimaging has a higher diagnostic yield than laboratory testing for assessing the etiology of optic atrophy and should be performed on all patients with unexplained optic atrophy.","title":"Diagnostic Yield of Laboratory Testing and Imaging Studies in Patients with Optic Atrophy in an Inner City Population","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175072\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nancy Blace, Nour Haddad, Tybee Eleff\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Bronx Lebanon Hospital, Bronx Lebanon Hospital, Bronx Lebanon Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, a rare but very possible complication can include sinus thrombosis, more specifically lateral sinus involvement. This can result in an increased intracranial pressure (ICP) thus result in bilateral optic nerve edema and/ or diplopia due to sixth nerve palsies.\n\nCase Report:\nA 5 year-old Caucasian female was referred to our clinic for diplopia following a 3 day hospital stay for treatment of dehydration, headache, vomiting, acute otitis media and mastoiditis. Best corrected visual acuities were 20/30 OD and 20/30- OS. Pupils were normal without APD but she was noted to have a mild left sixth nerve palsy. Anterior segment was within normal limits both eyes but the dilated examination revealed grade 3+ bilateral optic nerve edema. A CT scan had been performed when the patient was in the hospital so an MRI/MRA was ordered urgently for this patient which demonstrated a resolving left lateral sinus thrombosis with a suspected etiology of acute mastoiditis. She was re-admitted and treated with additional antibiotics and given anti-coagulant treatment until resolution of the thrombosis.\n\nDiscussion:\nLateral Sinus Thrombosis (LST) while rare, can be a complication of mastoiditis. It had almost 100% mortality rate before the intervention of antibiotics at the beginning. Therefore if not diagnosed, the rate of mortality or morbidity is extremely high especially in the pediatric population. Ocular findings including optic disc edema and nerve palsies often occur with this condition.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOcular signs and symptoms may be the first findings in LST and therefore requires the pediatric eye care provider to be an essential part in making the diagnosis and assisting with proper management of these patients. Co-management with neurology, otolaryngology and hematology are often critical in these cases.","title":"Diplopia and Bilateral Optic Nerve Edema: A Case of Lateral Sinus Thrombosis (LST) Secondary to Mastoditis in the Pediatric Patient","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175073\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Raneat Cohen, Taia Cordel\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Missouri - Dept of Ophthalmology, University of Missouri - Dept of Ophthalmology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

BCVA 20/20 OD/OS and pupils, confrontations, extraocular muscle movements and cover test were unremarkable. Binocular vision work-up was consistent with accommodative spasm while internal and external ocular health was unremarkable. She returned two weeks later, as directed, reporting constant diplopia with new onset right ptosis. Right pupil was sluggish, but reactive. She had a small angle right hypotropia and exotropia with restriction on up and in gaze consistent with CN III palsy. Following immediate MRI, and subsequent CT to rule out chondrosarcoma, she was referred to neurosurgery for an unspecified bone eroding tumor originating from the dorsum sella that was invading the cavernous sinus. Surgical resection was performed and histological analysis was consistent with a giant cell tumor.

Inaccuracies may be due to patient’s inability to cooperate with the technique, pain (eg. orbital fracture), or because of head or neck posturing. Almog, et al, have created a non-contact technique for exophthalmometry; its repeatability and comparison with contact techniques are unknown.  This study compared three novel devices for agreement and intersession repeatability as part of a laboratory exercise for novice optometry students.\n\nMethods:\nNovice optometry students were instructed in Hertel, Luedde and Almog (non-contact slit lamp) methods of exophthalmometry. Data collection was performed using each of three novel devices without regard to order on subjects (N=63). Three readings were obtained for each eye on two separate visits without regard for randomization. Descriptive statistics were created for each method and visit. Bland-Altman analysis was performed for right eye data using the average of all six readings from both visits. Repeatability of methods across visits was assessed by scatter plot with correlation coefficients.\n\nResults:\nData for each method was normally distributed except for the first visit for the Almog technique. Descriptive statistics for the average of the two visits were: Hertel 16.9+1.63 mm (13.0 to 20.7); Luedde 14.7+2.0 mm (9.6 to 18.2); Almog 11.8+2.0 mm (7.5 to 17.5). Paired-mean differences between methods were plotted against their average. Their relationship to the line of identity assessed: Hertel>Almog techniques (-5.1+2.3 mm); Luedde>Almog (-2.9+2.3 mm); Hertel>Luedde (-2.2+1.8 mm).

Most reported cases of acquired see-saw nystagmus have been associated with symptomatic oscillopsia and/or other forms of visual impairments.\n\nCase report:\nThis case report presents an asymptomatic 29-year-old male seen for initial routine eye exam. Clinical examination revealed a large angle constant alternating exotropia with a noticeable oscillatory nystagmus. The nystagmus was noted to be pendular with elevation and incyclotorsion of one eye and synchronous depression and excyclotortion of the fellow eye consistent with a diagnosis of see-saw nystagmus. All other clinical findings, including best corrected visual acuity and confrontational visual fields were normal. An urgent MRI of the brain revealed a non-enhancing cystic intrasellar and suprasellar mass measuring 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm touching the undersurface of the optic chiasm. The patient was referred to neuro-surgery for surgical intervention.\n\nDiscussion:\nSee-saw nystagmus has a distinctive clinical presentation of elevation and incyclotorsion in one eye with simultaneous depression and excyclotortion of the fellow eye. The nystagmus generally has a pendular waveform but can also present with a jerk waveform. It most commonly occurs in conjunction with a suprasellar mass lesion compressing or invading the brainstem bilaterally at the meso-diencephalic junction. Almost all reported cases of an acquired see-saw nystagmus have been shown to have symptomatic visual complaints to include oscillopsia, visual field defects in the form of a bitemporal hemianopia and/or reduction in best corrected visual acuity.\n\nConclusion:\nThis case is unique due to the asymptomatic nature of the presentation; likely due to the patient’s large angle constant alternating strabismus that resulted in binocular suppression masking the newly acquired see-saw nystagmus. The case highlights the importance of pursing and investigating an abnormal clinical finding despite the patient’s lack of visual complaints.","title":"A Rare Case of an Acquired Asymptomatic See-Saw Nystagmus","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175059\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Eyecare providers who are following these patients need to be aware of possible long term complications, including both tumor recurrence and short or long term effects of compression and/or radiation. One such long term complication, ocular neuromyotonia, is characterized by spontaneous paroxysmal impulses of extraocular muscles secondary to segmental axonal demyelination.\n\nCase Report:\nA 60 year-old woman is status-post resection of a right sphenoid/orbital meningioma with orital roof mesh reconstruction 8 years prior. Because of the atypical aggressive nature of the meningioma, she subsequently underwent multiple forms of radiation therapy over the years. Recent repeat MRI showed growth of the mass and increased cerebral edema. She is symptomatic of 30 second episodes of horizontal diplopia and spasm behind her right eye. She denies vertical diplopia despite a significant right infraduction deficit and right superior oblique limitation. We witness episodes of left-gaze induced right medial rectus spasm, suggestive of ocular neuromyotonia.\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough the patient exhibits restricted ocular motility related to tumor re-growth in the superior orbit, this is not causing her symptoms. Rather, she complains of paroxysmal spasm and esotropia from medial rectus ocular neuromyotonia. Recognizing the 2 different etiologies of ocular misalignment here is important because treatment plans differ. Although she will need additional radiation treatment, and possibly further debulking of the mass, that will not address her main complaint. Instead, membrane stabilizing medications, such as carbamezapine, are used to treat ocular neuromyotonia. Eye care providers need to be able to identify ocular neuromyotonia in order for patients to receive the most effective treatment for their symptoms.","title":"Late Post-Tumor Causes of Diplopia: A Recurrence vs. Ocular Neuromyotonia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175060\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Often seen in patients with vascular risk factors, the etiology is frequently microvascular with improvement noted within 3-6 months. However, these patients could also have more ominous causes including neoplasm, aneurysm, infection or inflammation and should be worked up as such.\n\nCase Report:\n1: A 72 year-old female presented with new onset diplopia. Her systemic history was remarkable for uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes mellitus and a history of thyroid cancer. Examination revealed a left abduction deficit. Work-up revealed an extra-axial mass along the cisternal and cavernous course of the left 6th nerve consistent with a meningioma. Despite the presence of the compressive mass, her double vision resolved and her abduction improved. On multiple follow-up visits she continued to exhibit a mild eso deviation, which was slightly greater on left gaze. It was felt that her presentation was consistent with resolved microvascular cranial nerve VI palsy with residual mild misalignment from the meningioma. Since she was no longer symptomatic, neuro-surgical intervention was not pursued, although she is still being monitored closely.\n\nConclusion(s):\nMicrovascular cranial nerve palsies are common but without an appropriate work-up, other etiologies could be missed. Although, having two potential causes for cranial nerve VI palsy is unlikely, it is always possible that a patient could have more then one condition. Because of this, all patients with new onset double vision should have blood work and neuro-imaging. If no cause is found, patients should be monitored monthly to make sure that improvement is occurring.","title":"Double the Trouble","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175061\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kelly Malloy, Erin Draper\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Complaints of blurry vision should always raise suspicion for subtle ocular misalignment because NPC has the potential to affect the cranial nerves innervating the extraocular muscles. Specifically, cranial nerve VI is one of the most common cranial nerve to be affected from NPC resulting in restricted abduction and diplopia.\n\nCase\n\nReport\n: A 52-year old man was referred for a vision examination prior to initiating radiation and chemotherapy for biopsy-proven NPC affecting the left nasopharynx and surrounding structures. He was concerned for recent onset blurry vision at distance, which improved when he covered either eye. Associated symptoms included hyperacusia and tinnitus in his left ear. Examination revealed a mild left abduction deficit and a non-comitant esodeviation that increased on left gaze with uncrossed diplopia at distance with Worth 4 Dot. A 4 BO Fresnel prism was given to alleviate subjective blur and diplopia on lateral gaze. He will be monitored for worsening/improvement as he undergoes chemotherapy and radiation as treatment of the NPC may potentially improve the abduction deficit.\n\nConclusion\n: It is common for patients to misinterpret mild diplopia as blurry vision due to their inability to discern two completely separate images, but it could be found with appropriate and accurate sensorimotor testing. It is imperative to recognize the cranial nerve involvement in patients with NPC as cranial nerve palsy may arise post-therapy as well. It is the clinician’s job to acknowledge whether the patient’s symptom is related to tumor recurrence or radiation-related cranial neuropathy. Therefore, close and constant neuro-ophthalmic surveillance is crucial for proper treatment.","title":"Cranial Nerve VI Involvement in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175062\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kelsey Moody\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This defect is a result of a unilateral lesion in the pons which affects the ipsilateral paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF), intranuclear fibers of the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus, and frequently the abducens nucleus. Stroke is the most common cause, but tumor, demyelination, or vasculitis has been reported. This case will describe a rare variant of one and one half syndrome.\n\n\n\nCase report:\nA 47-year-old white male was referred after sustaining a severe traumatic brain injury after a motor vehicle accident. The patient presented with facial paralysis of the right side, ptosis of the right upper eyelid, larger pupil OD with minimal reaction, neurotropic cornea with large abrasion (50-60% of the cornea) causing decreased visual acuity OD, and limited extraocular movements. Abduction was affected in both eyes as well as limited adduction OD. Confrontational visual fields were full to finger count, and convergence was spared. The horizontal Vestibulo-ocular reflex was limited OD>OS, but intact vertically.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\nThe patient was diagnosed with one and one half syndrome, an ipsilateral CN VII and an ipsilateral CN V palsy. One and one half syndrome in combination with CN VII palsy is coined eight and one half syndrome (7+1½=8½). Fifteen and one half syndrome was given if a bilateral CN VII palsy was present (7+7+1½=15½). Sixteen syndrome is used to describe a bilateral one and one half syndrome in addition to a bilateral CN VII palsy (7+7+1½+1½=16).  There has only been one other case report of thirteen and one half syndrome (7+5+1½=13½).

Medical history revealed that he had developed hypalgesia and thermohypesthesia on his ipsilateral face and contralateral body since he sustained a dorsolateral medullary infarction four years ago. An anterior segment slit-lamp examination showed a large corneal epithelial defect (6 x 3 mm2). The patient had minimal pain due to loss of corneal sensitivity from neurotrophic keratopathy (NK). The epithelial defect gradually healed in one month after topical therapy with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin ointment, and frequent use of preservative-free lubricants. The patient also presented with a longstanding right partial ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Pharmacological testing with apraclonidine was done to confirm the diagnosis of Horner’s syndrome secondary to the dorsolateral medullary infarction.\n\nConclusion(s):\nDorsolateral medullary infarction is a complex neurological disorder with various signs and symptoms. The onset of NK can be delayed and is a rare complication. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of NK and Horner’s syndrome due to dorsolateral medullary infarction.","title":"Ocular Manifestations of Dorsolateral Medullary Infarction (Wallenberg Syndrome) with Neurotrophic Keratopathy and Horner’s Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175065\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Central Texas VA Healthcare System: Austin Outpatient Clinic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Hyewon Chang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Central Texas Veterans Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, unusual visual field defects can also occur requiring prompt testing and referrals.\n\nCase Report:\nA 60-year-old female reported decreased nasal visual field and dimming of lights in left eye for 6-8 weeks following cryosurgery on left lower lid for basal cell carcinoma. Past eye surgical history included Mohs surgery and reconstruction on right lower lid for basal cell carcinoma in 2010. Relevant past medical history included diabetes mellitus type 2. Visual acuity in left eye was 20/60, pinhole no improvement. Left eye presented with trace afferent pupillary defect and smaller pupil, decreased color vision, decreased red cap desaturation, and slightly pale optic nerve. Humphrey visual field 30-2 revealed dense nasal hemi-field defect and overall depression in left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large sellar mass with suprasellar extension with compression of the left optic nerve and right cavernous sinus invasion with mildly involved medial margins of the left cavernous sinus. Neurology diagnosed the patient with a large pituitary macroadenoma and scheduled for computed tomography to prepare for bilateral transsphenoidal endoscopic hypophysectomy with pituitary tumor resection surgery. Patient recuperated without complications. Patient returned to clinic three months after her first optometry visit. She reported increased energy and rosiness of cheeks. Her blond hair was growing back. Visual acuity in left eye was 20/20, and glasses were dispensed. Repeat 30-2 revealed improved visual field.\n\nConclusion(s):\nPituitary tumors can present with varying symmetry and severity of field defects depending on the tumor’s size and location.

Recently, use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become ubiquitous and is utilized in diagnosis of a multitude of neurological disorders. It has been demonstrated that retrograde atrophy can occur in the eye from post-geniculate pathway injury. Therefore, patterns of OCT RNFL and ganglion cell loss can be used adjunctively to confirm the presence of pre or post-geniculate visual pathway dysfunction.\n\nCase Report:\nWe present a series of patients that demonstrated classic visual field loss (homonymous quadranopsia and hemianopsia) from traumatic brain injury or neoplastic causes. OCT scans captured by Avanti (Optovue) or Cirrus 5000 (Zeiss) show patterned loss on both RNFL thickness maps as well as the Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC) maps. The normative databases in these instruments are targeted primarily at glaucoma patients and thus axonal damage from non-glaucomatous entities may not be always be identified as abnormal, especially in both eyes when field loss is homonymous. Careful review of the data revealed that these patients exhibited changes that would correlate structural loss to functional loss. This was even more apparent with the parietal lobe cases, in which the RNFL thickness maps look generally normal. However, upon closer inspection, there is a subtle reduction in the ipsilateral superior arcuate RNFL and contralateral superior papillomacular bundle. The GCC maps showed thinning in a quadranopsic pattern that correlates to the visual field loss.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis case series demonstrates the importance of OCT as an adjunctive test to validate loss on perimetry. Patterned loss can be seen on the RNFL and GCC maps which correlates nicely with functional loss. However, these changes may be quite subtle as well as confusing when trying to correlate the location of the retinal axons to the visual field loss.","title":"Patterned Ganglion Cell Loss in Visual Afferent Pathway Dysfunction","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175067\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern California College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Judy Tong\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Marshall B.

Spatial localization is one of the elements needed to accurately and efficiently navigate the environment and prevent falls. The aim of this study was to address the association between contrast sensitivity loss and falls.\n\nMethods:\nA retrospective review of electronic health record data was gathered at the Ferris State University Eye Center. Thirty-six patient records were reviewed from the Vision Rehabilitation Service to associate the incidence of falls with contrast sensitivity loss. Data collected included age, ocular diagnoses and fall history, any difficulties with orientation and mobility, and contrast sensitivity values. This data was inputted into a spreadsheet with all patient-identifying information removed.\n\nResults:\nA statistical analysis of the data gathered was completed to uncover an association between contrast sensitivity and falls. The information was analyzed to determine the range of contrast sensitivity loss, which leads to a higher probability of falls. A strong correlation was discovered between contrast sensitivity loss and a history of falls (p=0.0001). No correlation was discovered between contrast sensitivity loss and orientation and mobility deficits (p=0.1907). The strongest correlation made was between increasing age and orientation and mobility deficits (p=0.00001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe results of this pilot study support the need for additional research into the relationship between contrast sensitivity loss and falls with a larger sample size. With this information, eye care providers will be better able to predict the risk of falls in the low vision population as it relates to loss of contrast sensitivity and orientation and mobility problems and make appropriate rehabilitation referrals.","title":"The Association between Contrast Sensitivity Loss and Falls in a Low Vision Population","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175053\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Michigan College of Optomery Ferris State Universi\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Margaret Baumgartner, Taylor Oie\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Maryland VA Medical Center, Michigan College of Optometry at Ferris State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Predicted magnification formulas are used by practitioners to determine the amount of magnification needed for patients to achieve near acuity goals. By determining the accuracy of these formulas, practitioners will employ the most effective and efficient device and power selection strategies to meet the demands of the patient’s near activities of daily living.\n\nMethods:\nThe study was a retrospective chart analysis of 68 patients that presented for examination at the University Eye Center, Vision Rehabilitation Service between over 13 years with a primary diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration, an uncorrected near visual acuity recorded in metric notation (M) and recorded final near device power. The formula V = M x D was utilized. The results of this formula were then compared to the final near device power selected by the patient. Accuracy of the predicted magnification was characterized by the following criteria: an accurate prediction demonstrated a difference of +/- 4D, a non-accurate prediction was categorized into> + 4D (greater than 4D higher than predicted) or >- 4D (greater than 4D lower than predicted).\n\nResults:\nThe results were analyzed using a distribution plot that represents the spread of subjectively chosen magnification as compared to predicted magnification. An accurate prediction was made for 31 of 97 patients (32%). A non-accurate prediction was made for 66 of 97 patients (68%). Of the non-accurate predictions, three of 97, or 3% were greater than 4D below the predicted value, and 63 of 97, or 65% were greater than 4D above the predicted value. The mean difference was +5.525 D from the predicted magnification value.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe formula does not accurately predict near magnification.

But, the same can not be said of many traditional low vision devices which have seen minimal change in the areas of design and function. The purpose of this study was to better understand the characteristics low vision patients value when using a stand magnifier and how these improvements can guide future product development.\n\nMethods:\n\nLow vision subjects (n=35) participated in evaluating three illuminated stand magnifiers (ISM): a 5x Mattingly SMDedge®, a 5x Carson optical LumiLoupe, and a Comfortview®, a custom ISM. To assess the expectations of their ideal ISM, pre and post questionnaires of desired qualities were used.  The ISMs were randomized and near visual acuities were measured with the Single Letter Lighthouse card. Following each trial, subjects rated the magnifier’s qualities using a 4 point Likert-like scale. Subjects also ranked their preferred ISM and described the attributes which drove this decision. The data was collected and analyzed using Microsoft Excel (Version 2010).\n\nResults:\nInitial expectations on stand magnifier function highlighted the importance of image quality (Avg.[SD]: 3.58[0.68]), portability (3.25[0.76]), and comfort (3.00[0.94]) as being the three most important factors. Post evaluation criterion remained consistent with image quality being the most important factor in 49% of the patients, portability (29%) and comfort (29%) being the second and third most important factors, respectively. A majority of our subjects (63%) had some prior experience with stand magnifiers.\n\nConclusion(s):\n\nWith the low vision population expected to increase, devices with the best image quality will prevail. The researchers were surprised that size and appearance were not as important when selecting a device. The data suggests optimal low vision magnifiers should have superior optics but not discount features such as portable and comfortable housing.","title":"Identifying Desirable Characteristics of Stand Magnifiers among a Low Vision Cohort","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175055\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Justin Kozloski, Matt Valdes\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Rosenberg School of Optometry, Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Studies of low vision (LV) provision by optometrists in the US are currently lacking. This study was designed to elucidate self-reported optometric practice patterns for patients with mild vision loss.\n\nMethods:\nA total of 235 anonymous surveys were completed online by AAO primary care section members (n=93) and in-person at optometric CE events in FL, MA and NY (n=142). The survey inquired about the respondent’s frequency of prescribing the following LV management strategies: high adds (≥+3.00), optical aids (e.g., magnifier) or referral for a LV consultation. Respondents were divided into three groups as follows: Group R: non-LV Residency trained (22%), Group LV: LV residency trained or actively practicing LV (29%), or Group A: All other respondents (no postgraduate specialty training and not actively practicing LV) (49%).\n\nResults:\nIn Group A, 27% (n=28) of respondents indicated no incorporation of LV management strategies for VAs 20/25-40; in contrast only 9% (n=4) of those in Group R (OR: 0.29; p = 0.04), and 4% (n=2) of LV practitioners (OR: 0.12; p = 0.006) indicated no incorporation of some of the surveyed LV strategies for VAs 20/25-40. Roughly one third (32%; n=33) of Group A practitioners did not prescribe high adds for VAs 20/25-40 and 17% of that group reported no LV management strategies for VAs 20/50-70, while years in practice (p = 0.25), practice modality (p = 0.33) and number of patients with mild visual impairment (p = 0.89) were not significantly related to lack of management strategies.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis survey reveals that a sizable group of non-LV providers may not be addressing the near vision needs of patients with mild vision loss. Future studies of management strategies for this population should elucidate potential barriers and benefits.","title":"Study of Optical Aids for Reading (SOAR): A Survey of Optometric Management of Mild Vision Loss","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175056\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Drs.

In Singapore, most patients with eye diseases will have their eye conditions first diagnosed and treated in restructured hospital and referred to Low Vision Optometrist when necessary. OT intervention has been part of the VR model in low vision care in the recent years. Hence, this poster aims to describe and evaluate the demographics of our patients who were offered OT services and the reasons for the poor uptake.\n\nMethod:\nData review of 157 patients who were offered OT intervention as part of their VR programme was done retrospectively. Patients’ demographics and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the better eye were analysed. The number of patients who declined OT intervention and their reasons were documented.\n\nResults\n: Out of the 816 patients who were seen at the low vision clinic in SNEC in 2016, 19.2% were deemed to be suitable and may benefit from OT intervention. Of these, 59.9% declined OT intervention. 55.3% of them stated that they are not interested in OT intervention, while 22.3% cited that they have engaged full time domestic helper to help in the activities of daily living (ADL).\n\nConclusion(s):\nMost of the patients who were offered OT intervention are living with their families and care-givers and this could be one of the reasons for the lack of motivation. The affordability of hiring full time domestic help and easy access to amenities in Singapore could possibly lead to reduced need and motivation to learn skills in independent living.","title":"Vision Rehabilitation Model in Singapore","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175047\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Singapore National Eye Centre\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Tan Zhen Kiat, Lynn Tan, Chong Chiew Luan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore National Eye Centre\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Traditionally this test is not used for children with LV as they were excluded from the normative sample upon which standard scores were developed. There are no tests that measure visual-motor integration available that have been validated for use by children with LV.\n\nMethods:\n35 children enrolled in kindergarten or first grade with LV not correctable with glasses or contacts lenses participated in a prospective study on reading using a battery of tests that addressed domains known to be associated with reading, including the Beery VMI, Batelle Developmental Inventory, and Conners Early Childhood. Binocular distance acuity with habitual correction was measured using the EVA ETDRS protocol if the child knew all of their letters well or ATS protocol if HOTV testing was needed. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, ANOVA and Spearman correlations.\n\nResults:\nThe sample included 17 kindergarteners and 18 first-graders. Participants were mostly male (57%), white (60%) and had a family income less than $50K per year (55%). The most common diagnosis was albinism (31%). Mean VA was 0.8 logMAR (range 0.1-1.5).  Mean standard score on the VMI was 90 ± 9 (range 70-114). This is significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than the population mean (100 ± 15). All participants were able to complete the test, including 3 with the worst VA (1.4-1.5 logMAR) who scored between 82 and 85 on the VMI. Visual acuity was not significantly associated with VMI score (ρ = -0.19, p = 0.3). Additionally, there were no significant associations between race, gender, or teacher report of hyperactivity and score. Higher VMI score was however, associated with family income greater than $50K per year.\n\nConclusion(s):\nChildren with LV can successfully perform VMI testing. When visual motor integration difficulties are suspected in a child with vision impairment, Beery VMI testing should be considered.","title":"Can the Beery VMI be used for Children with Low Vision?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175048\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sarah Lee, Lisa Forte, Gerald McGwin, Dawn DeCarlo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham, UAB Center for Low-Vision Rehab, University of Alabama at Birmingham, UAB Center for Low Vision Rehabilitation\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Little research has been done to assess any benefit of technological devices such as eBook readers to compensate for declining abilities in the meaningful activity of reading for older nursing home residents. We conducted a survey to examine the activity of reading for older nursing residents, challenges that limit reading, and relationship to quality of life. We also wanted to explore any benefits to using an eBook reader to minimize reading challenges for this cohort.\n\nMethods:\nOlder nursing home residents were recruited from two local nursing homes. After obtaining written consent, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered to ensure mental capacity required to answer survey questions. An individual was excluded from the study if he/she achieved an MMSE score of less than 18.The participant was awarded a $25 Target gift card for participation.\n\nResults:\nForty-two subjects (64.3% female, average age 79.9 ± 8.2 years) participated. Eight participants (19%) currently or have previously owned an eBook reader. Of those, 100% agree or strongly agree that it is helpful for reading and seven of the eight agree or strongly agree that it makes text easier to see. A 50% of participants feel that vision is at least part of the reason why they do not read as much as they would like, and 69% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that spending more time engaged in reading would improve daily life. People were significantly more likely to indicate that they were willing to use an eBook reader when they also reported that vision hindered their ability to read (x\n2\n= 6.191, p=0.045).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe data suggest that nursing home residents may benefit from eBook readers, specifically those who experience vision-related difficulties reading.

Usual care was provided with VAE and training (i.e. orientation and mobility, occupational therapy) as clinically indicated.\nA device abandonment questionnaire was administered 3 months and 1 year post-LVR. The questionnaire asked patients if each device was received, how often it was used, for which tasks it was used, or why it was not used.

The most frequently recommended VAE were illuminated handheld magnifiers (n=38), handheld digital magnifiers (n=27), indoor filters (n=19), and outdoor filters (n=17).\nHandheld magnifiers (97%) and outdoor filters (94%) were most commonly used 3 months post-LVR. All devices in these categories had been received and abandonment was rare. Digital magnification devices were never abandoned, although a large proportion had not been received 3 months post-LVR (56% of handheld and 40% of desktop devices).\nOne year post-LVR VAE assessment (n=100, data collection ongoing) revealed that hand magnifiers and outdoor filters continue to be utilized most often.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn mobile clinic LVR patients, near magnification devices were most often prescribed and least frequently abandoned.

For example, personal digital assistants (e.g., Siri and Alexa) provide instant and easier access to information and services. These devices may be particularly helpful for the visually impaired since they do not require vision. However, it is currently unknown whether visually impaired individuals are taking advantage of these devices since there are no formal studies on this topic. The current study aimed to collect data regarding potential usefulness, attitudes and obstacles for personal digital assistant usage.\n\nMethods:\nSurveys on the use of digital assistants were administered to 21 visually impaired individuals ranging in age from 32-76 with a mean of 49 years.\n\nResults:\nThe majority of the respondents (71%) felt their vision was poor, 24% classified vision as fair, and only one reported good vision. All except one (95%) had been told they were legally blind. None reported hearing loss. The majority (81%) reported use of a smartphone; the primary reason for not owning one was cost. In contrast, only about a quarter of respondents (24%) reported use of a freestanding digital assistant. Primary reasons for not owning a freestanding digital assistant were cost (50%) unfamiliarity (20%) & no need or interest (20%). Wireless Internet access at home, reported by 86%, was not a major limitation. Among those who used digital assistants, the most common applications were setting timers and alarms, online searches, checking the weather and listening to music. All respondents noted potential usefulness of personal digital assistants.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis survey revealed the minimal uptake of digital assistants by relatively young, legally blind individuals. While clinicians may help to educate these patients who are interested in digital assistants about their potential applications, future studies are also needed elucidate their value for this population.","title":"Survey of Digital Assistant Usage by Visually Impaired Individuals","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175051\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ava Bittner, So Yeon Lee, David Loshin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

That is, they look in about the same place most of the time when watching directed content (i.e. movies and most TV programming). People with central vision loss (CVL) often report difficulty watching video (e.g. TV, computers, cinema). Do people with CVL look in the same places and does this relate to the reported difficulty?\n\nMethods:\nThe scanpaths of subjects with CVL (n=21), with normal vision (n=63), and with NV that was blurred by defocus (n=15; visual acuity from 20/50 to 20/800) were measured as they watched 20 to 46 short (30s) video clips. Scanpath coherence was measured using the normalized scanpath salience (NSS) method. To test whether there was a disadvantage to the scanpath of a person with CVL,  351 on-line participants with NV watched clips on which only a restricted region was visible (either matching the scanpath of the NV group or that of a subject with CVL).  Their task was to describe the video.\n\nResults:\nSubjects with CVL made longer fixations and shorter saccades than the NV group.

This suggests that rehabilitation methods using magnification that rely on the person with CVL locating and looking at the objects of interest in active scenes may not be successful.","title":"Where Do People with Central Vision Loss Look When Watching Videos?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175052\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Francisco Costela, Dylan Rose, Daniel Saunders, Sidika Kajtezovic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute and Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research Institute, Schepens Eye Research Institute and Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Attenuation coefficients (AC) aim to overcome these problems. This study investigates the feasibility of using AC to quantify characteristics of the RNFL by assessing test-retest variability and within-subject variability at different retinal locations.\n\nMethods:\nMontages of the posterior pole were made from scans acquired using SD-OCT (Heidelberg Spectralis™). AC was quantified by averaging the AC of each pixel within circular regions of interest (ROI) with a radius of 25 pixels. Custom MATLAB programs were developed for montaging and quantifying the AC. ROIs were carefully chosen to include areas with varying RNFL thicknesses, from near the optic nerve head (ONH) to the horizontal raphe, at the same time avoiding artifacts such as blood vessels, specular reflections, and gliosis at any given depth. Smaller ROIs with a radius of 15 pixels were used in some areas due to smaller gaps between small blood vessels.\n\nResults:\nTest-retest variability of AC was as large as 0.5 log unit. Within the RNFL, peak AC decreased from 1.1 log unit near the ONH to 0.4 log unit at the raphe. The depth at which AC peaked also decreased from 68µm to 16µm respectively. Within a subject, comparing similar regions in the superior and inferior retina and comparing regions near the optic nerve and the raphe, the AC differed by 0.7 up to 1.5 log unit respectively. Going down in depth, AC initially increased quickly by up to 1 log unit, then remained relatively constant before declining; difference in AC with depth ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 log unit, with an interquartile range of 0.1 to 0.2 log unit.\n\nConclusion(s):\nWe replicated a report of effects of retinal location on AC and documented high test-retest variability. Further work to reduce variability will be required before AC can be feasible for RNFL analysis.","title":"Attenuation Coefficient as a Measure of Reflectivity to Quantify and Characterize Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Characteristics","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175035\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        William Swanson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

We investigated the relation between presumed ARAM and glaucomatous abnormality, taking advantage of the enhanced contrast and improved axial resolution provided by OCT enface technology, to assess the potential use of ARAM as a predictor of glaucoma.\n\nMethods:\nSpectralis OCT was used to image the central ±24 degrees of the retina in 41 controls and 38 patients with glaucoma, with mean ages 69 (±8) and 63 (±9) years respectively. Reflectance slab-images were generated at 10 -14μm. We quantified the surface area of the slab-images covered by putative ARAM. A Chi-square test was used  to compare the proportions of patients versus controls with putative ARAM. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the retinal surface area covered by putative ARAM in patients versus controls.\n\nResults:\nPutative ARAM was present in 28 of the 38 patients and in 23 of the 41 controls,  χ²(1, N = 79) = 2.67, p = 0.10.  The median (25\nth\npercentile, 75\nth\npercentile) retinal area covered by putative ARAM in controls was 1 (0, 6) deg. square, and that in patients was 11 (0, 43) deg. square. The Mann-Whitney U test found mean ranks of 32 and 48 in controls and patients respectively, U= 472, p=0.002.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe presence of ARAM in a subject was not a strong indicator of glaucomatous abnormality. However, patients with glaucoma generally had a greater retinal surface area covered by putative ARAM than controls. Further study is needed to understand this finding before putative ARAM seen on OCT enface images can be considered as a potential indicator of glaucoma.","title":"Putative Proliferated Glia Seen On OCT En Face Imaging: Implications For Glaucoma Related Patient Care","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175036\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Brett King, William Swanson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study compares three low vision reading strategies to determine which method offers a higher reading speed. The goal is to obtain results that may help guide the practitioner in providing low vision recommendations.\n\nMethods:\nStudents with best corrected visual acuity from 20/80-20/400 were invited to participate;15 of the tested subjects met the eligibility guidelines. Participants were evaluated with the MNRead test to determine the amount of magnification needed for reading. After the predicted accommodative demand was determined, the subjects read 3 passages from the DIBELS Oral reading Fluency test using 3 different low vision strategies and the correct words read per minute was recorded.\n\nThe first strategy utilized Relative Distance Magnification (RDM). If the subject required an add lens, it was provided in a trial frame. The second strategy utilized a portable electronic magnification device (PEMD) held at a pre-determined distance from the student’s spectacle plane and set to the appropriate magnification. The third strategy used the same PEMD, however, the subjects were permitted to set the magnification and viewing distance to a level they deemed appropriate. For this study, the Ruby XL HD by Freedom Scientific was used.\n\nResults:\nOf the 15 subjects tested, 93% read faster utilizing RDM when compared to using a PEMD; however, this was not statistically significant. When comparing a PEMD set to a magnification level clinically indicated for the subject to a magnification that they chose, 9 performed the same or faster using a magnification that was predicted.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThere was an overall trend for the subjects to read faster with RDM; however, a larger sample size is needed in order to obtain statistical significance. It is evident that with proper magnification, many visually impaired students are able to read normal printed text.","title":"Reading Performance in Young Visually Impaired Students: Comparing Relative Distance Magnification to a Portable Electronic Device","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175039\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        David Lewerenz\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UCHealth Eye Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

In the United States, 25 to 35% of adults over age 65 fall each year, resulting in significant health care expenditures and impacting quality of life. Visually impaired patients have a higher fall risk than the general population, and this study reviews vision function tests and two balance tests to see which are accurate predictors of who is at risk.\n\nMethods:\nThis study looks at two balance tests, Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Berg Balance Scale, in addition to visual function measures of acuity, contrast and field. IRB approval was obtained through the University of Michigan for this prospective study. Patients 60 and over with acuity 20/60 or worse seen in our low vision clinic were invited to participate.\n\nResearch:\nThe participants are classified as fallers if they recalled 1 or more falls in the past year, otherwise they are considered non-fallers. Of the 36 study participants, eleven (30.6%) are fallers and twenty five (69.4%) are non-fallers. Although we do not know the precise cost of their fall-related health care, we can tally 2 doctor office visit only, 3 ER visits with follow-up, 2 hospital stays and 2 physical therapy programs in our faller group in the past year. The two tests designed to predict fall risk based on balance, TUG and Berg Balance Scale, show a statistically significant difference between the group of fallers and non-fallers. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, peripheral fields and presence of central scotoma are not statistically significantly worse in fallers than in non-fallers group.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIncorporating a balance test into our low vision workup may identify fall risk better than considering acuity, field or contrast alone. Further study with a large sample is essential to enable us to identify those visually impaired patients at risk of falling and to refer them to fall prevention exercise programs.","title":"Risk of Falls for Older Visually Impaired Patients, Pilot Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175041\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sherry Day, Ashley Howson, Melanie Askari\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of MI, University of Michigan, New York City Department of health\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Our hypothesis is that patient preference would vary both on subjective and objective findings, and that filter evaluations are not being implemented in regular low vision care. Therefore a comprehensive filter evaluation is necessary for all patients with RP.\n\nMethods:\n15 patients with RP were given a short survey regarding their condition including any previous filter evaluation and preference. Objective measurements were collected using the MARS contrast sensitivity chart with patients wearing yellow, orange, grey, plum, and amber tints. Subjective measurement was done utilizing forced choice method with all the filters being presented in a random order.\n\nResults:\nAge range of patients: 28 to 64 years. Length of diagnoses: 4 years to 38 years. Average length of diagnosis: 18 years. 60% of all patients had never undergone a filter evaluation, with 33.33% of subjects responding that they do not wear any type of filtered lens and never were educated about tinted lenses as a management option. Subjective preference range was 47% for plum, 20% for grey, 20 % for amber, 6.5% for yellow, and 6.5% for orange. Objective findings did not correlate to subjective findings, with 46% for yellow, 27% for plum, 20% for orange, 7% for amber, and 0% for grey.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur results indicate that there is a significant lack of awareness regarding filter evaluation and wear in patients with RP, which was consistent with our hypothesis. This study also suggests no clear preference pattern for any particular filter in patients with RP, thereby proving our hypothesis that a comprehensive filter evaluation is recommended for all patients with this condition. As such, each filter evaluation should be performed with a focus on the individual and their specific task and no general trends or conclusions should be drawn.","title":"Preference of Tinted Therapeutic Spectacle Lenses Among Patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175042\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kendon Seamons, Corom Eisley, Joshua Brooks, Vladimir Yevseyenkov\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a, n/a, n/a, n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Although low vision patients use variable working distances and optical systems to enlarge print, replicating the minimum angle of resolution (MAR) is used to compare acuity performance at different test distances. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between distance and near acuities among a low vision cohort.\n\nMethods:\nDistance and near visual acuity, with correction, in the right and left eye were measured in 36 low vision subjects using ETDRS, Feinbloom and Lighthouse near acuity test charts. Test distance varied from 4m to 1m, depending on the patient’s ability to resolve the target. Near acuities were measured at a working distance with respect to their habitual bifocal ADD power. All acuities were converted to logMAR, comparing the relationship between visual performances at distance and near, as well as right and left eyes. Subjects who we were unable to record an acuity in either eye were excluded.\n\nResults:\nFor our cohort (n =58), each eye was independently compared at distance and near. A two-way repeated ANOVA across test distances (F=3.53, p=0.063) found a trend towards statistical significance. Distance acuities (mean±SD,0.80±0.38 logMAR) were correlated (r=0.52) and on average 1 line (0.14 logMAR) better when compared to near acuities (0.94±0.45 logMAR). A paired t-test was found to be statistically significant (t=-3.55, p<.0001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nAlthough differences in distance and near acuities were statistical significance among our low vision cohort, factors such as glare, light sensitivity, contrast and other co-morbidities may have played a role in the disparities between distance and near function. These findings may suggest a subtle overestimation clinically, when using distance acuities to predict near vision among low vision patients.","title":"Investigating the Relationship Between Distance and Near Acuities Among a Low Vision Cohort","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175043\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Matt Valdes, Stephanie Schmiedecke, Justin Kozloski, Jason Ha\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word, University of the Incarnate Word, University of the Incarnate Word, University of the Incarnate Word\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

We presented a novel multiplexing prism (MxP) glasses that superimpose the see-through and shifted views for true field expansion without apical scotoma. The width, location, and face form tilt of the MxP has to be customized individually to account for patient’s facial dimensions, nasal field size and lens prescription to achieve the widest field expansion. We developed a low-cost solution for the customization using 3D printing.\n\nMethods:\nWe designed a customized clip-on MxP holder where the face form tilt of MxP can be adjusted after mounting on the user’s spectacles frame. The clip-on MxP holder with an adjustable tilting arm was 3D-printed in nylon. It fits to the nose bridge and the upper rim of the spectacles frame using integrated clip-on hooks. Multiple grooves in the tilting arm and body are used to adjust the face form tilt of MxP segment by sliding a nylon wedge among the grooves. With the clip-on attached on the frame, we measure the patient’s nasal field size and adjust the tilting arm and the size of MxP segment to achieve the widest field expansion. Then, the wedge is permanently glued in the appropriate groove.\n\nResults:\n3D-printed clip-on MxP holders were fitted to two patients: patient A (42° nasal field, myopic correction) and patient B (50° nasal field, emmetrope). We used the wedge to adjust the face form tilt of the MxP to -3° and -6°, respectively, and trimmed the MxP segment to the right width. Patient A and B could detect the V4e target in Goldmann perimetry up to 76° and 80° in the nasal side, respectively. The 3D printing cost only $4 per holder (excluding MxP cost).\n\nConclusion(s):\nA low-cost 3D-printed clip-on MxP holder could successfully expand the nasal field of AMV patients into the blind side. Customization of the MxP fitting is simple and flexible, resulting in wide field expansion without any fitting errors.","title":"3D-Printed Clip-on Multiplexing Prism Holder for Field Expansion in Acquired Monocular Vision","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175044\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nish Mohith Kurukuti, Eli Peli\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute, Schepens Eye Research Institute Harvard Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Children with CVI show decreased visual acuity in the presence of increased contour interaction. We predicted that children with CVI with the greatest reduction in acuity due to contour interaction would have reduced contrast sensitivity. We performed a retrospective study of children with CVI comparing measures of Lea symbols visual acuity with contour bars at 100% and 50% spacing to threshold contrast sensitivity measured with the Cambridge Low-Contrast Grating Test.\n\nMethods:\n25 children (14 female, 11 male) aged 3-20 (mean age=9) with a diagnosis of CVI participated during a comprehensive vision examination. Visual acuity was measured using the apple and house Lea symbols optotypes in a two-alternative forced choice task with edge-to-edge (between the optotype and bar) spacings of 50% and 100% times the optotype width. The optotypes and flanker bars were both at 100% contrast. Contrast sensitivity was measured in the same visit using the Cambridge Low-Contrast Grating Test in a two-alternative forced choice task.\n\nResults:\nThe relationship between visual acuity with increased contour interaction was compared to threshold contrast sensitivity. A greater difference in visual acuity with 50% compared to 100% Lea symbols (in logMAR) was correlated with decreased contrast sensitivity (in log Michelson contrast); a Pearson correlation of 0.669 and R^2 value of 0.4477 (p= 4.88E-28).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis study compared the relationship between visual acuity, in the presence of contour interaction, and contrast sensitivity in children with CVI. Preliminary findings show a positive correlation between contour interaction and contrast sensitivity. Consideration of contour interaction and contrast sensitivity may be informative when making recommendations to and determining educational interventions for children with CVI.","title":"Decreased Contrast Sensitivity is Associated with Decreased Visual Acuity Due to Contour Interaction in Children with Cerebral Visual Impairment","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175045\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Deborah Orel-Bixler\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UC Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Continuous-wear base-left yoked prisms are a popular but little-studied treatment for these behaviors. They shift the wearer's view of their body and the scene in the same direction and so may not affect collision judgments. A novel yoked-split prism shifts the view of the body left and the scene right. We hypothesized that this would reduce collision judgment asymmetry, whereas yoked prisms would not.\n\nMethods:\n6 LSN patients viewed a virtual shopping mall corridor (with optic flow to simulate walking) and reported if they would have collided with a human obstacle that appeared for 1s at various offsets up to 13.5º from the walking path (88 trials per condition). Conditions (counterbalanced) were (1) no prism, (2) yoked-split prisms (upper 12Δ base left and lower 10Δ base right), (3) low power (4Δ or 7Δ) base-left yoked prisms, and (4) 20Δ base-left yoked prisms.\n\nResults:\nWithout prisms there was a rightward asymmetry in collision judgments (p < 0.001). Both split prisms (p < 0.001) and 20Δ (p = 0.01) reduced the asymmetry, whereas 4Δ or 7Δ had no effect (p = 0.51). Split prisms had a larger effect on the asymmetry than 20Δ (p=0.01), over-correcting (p = 0.03); whereas with 20Δ there was no asymmetry (p=0.22).\n\nConclusion(s):\nContrary to our hypothesis, 20Δ yoked-prism reduced asymmetry, perhaps due to minification (distortion) near the base or non-visual referencing of body position (e.g. proprioception). Split prism (12Δ/10Δ) had a greater effect than 20Δ. Further study is warranted to determine if improvements remain after adaptation and effects during actual ambulation.","title":"Split-Prisms to Improve Collision Judgments in Left Spatial Neglect: A Pilot Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175046\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Mass Eye and Ear, Harvard Department of Ophthalmology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Russell Woods, Alex Bowers, Eli Peli\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute, Schepens Eye Research Institute, Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Rarely, LAZ may be associated with gene mutation causing late-onset retinal degeneration, but another LAZ variety, possibly with >2% prevalence, is being investigated as a potential risk factor for glaucoma. In earlier case-control study, association was found between remnants of the anterior tunica vasculosa lentis (RATVL) and LAZ, adding suspicion that this LAZ type may also result from genetic mutation. With new study, we further investigated the LAZ-RATVL relationship.\n\nMethods:\nPatients at an urban, academic eye care facility in Chicago, IL, USA were examined by multiple practitioners, with data on demographic, systemic, and ocular variables assisted by record review and questionnaire. The LAZ-RATVL relationship was explored using multivariate regression to control for other factors.\n\nResults:\nThere were 2,468 subjects (64.1% female, 82.5% African-American) with mean age=51.2 +/- 15.5 years (18-94 years). Among right eyes, 377 (15.5%) had RATVL and 121 (4.9%) had LAZ. RATVL prevalence was 27.3% among LAZ eyes vs. 14.7% among non-LAZ eyes (P < 0.0001), hyperopic (P < 0.01), females (P < 0.05) with early exposure to smoking in the home (OR=1.6; 0.9 to 2.6; P=0.08).\n\nConclusion(s):\nSince children exposed to smoking in the home are also likely to have gestational exposure to tobacco byproducts, this analysis suggests that developmental exposures to tobacco or related factors might be influential toward development of RATVL, and possibly LAZ. More study is therefore warranted.","title":"Relationship Between Childhood Tobacco Smoke Exposure, Remnants of the Anterior Tunica Vasculosa Lentis, and Long Anterior Lens Zonules","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175031\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Janice McMahon, Christina Morettin, Tricia Newman, Mary Roberts, Bruce Teitelbaum, Janis Winters\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Past literature has defined the defects to be tritan (Blue-yellow). The new table based color vision tests offer simpler and faster ways of measuring color defects in clinical practice. Tritan defects were compared with visual fields and ganglion cell complex testing (GCC).\n\nMethods:\nSingle site, retrospective, unsponsored study looking at glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. Color vision was tested with Konan Medical’s tablet based ColorDx. White on white visual fields were performed on Octopus 301 (Haag-Streit). Ganglion cell complex analysis was performed with OptoVue’s IVue and reported as focal (FLV) and global (GLV) loss volume. The left eye results were analyzed since there may be varying degrees of learning with each test and right eyes were tested first.\n\nResults:\nThere were 37 subjects (11 male, 26 female). Average age was 24.9 ± 20.9. The ColorDx scores showed weak inverse correlation to FLV (r=-0.30, p=0.036) and GLV (-0.27, p=0.053). The scores showed a strong inverse correlation to 30-2 mean defect (r=-0.61, p < 0.001) and loss variance (r=-0.66, p < 0.001). Inverse correlation to 10-2 mean defect (r=-0.47, p=0.002) and loss variance (r=-0.55, p < 0.001) was also moderate. With a ColorDx score < 10, the odds ratio of having a significant loss variance (LV) was 9.09 [0.94-89.96], p=0.057 for 10-2 LV and 20.83 [2.04-212.97], p=0.011 for 30-2.\n\nConclusion(s):\nPrevious studies have shown poor agreement between functional visual field loss and structural OCT for progression. For diagnosis, tablet-based color vision testing scores have a strong correlation to visual field defects and mild correlation to GCC thinning.","title":"Tablet-Based Color Vision Testing and Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175032\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Justin Kwan, Nathalie Bernabe\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern California College of Optometry MB Ketchum Univ, Private Practice\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study examined whether glaucoma suspects with greater baseline asymmetries in macular thickness (MT), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, cup/disc ratio (CDR), and/or visual field (VF) metrics are associated with higher rates of subsequent RNFL and VF change over time.\n\nMethods\n: All subjects for this study were participating in a longitudinal glaucoma research study at the Albuquerque VA Medical Center and were required to have optic nerve appearances suspicious for glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension with no repeatable VF loss.  All subjects had baseline examinations that included dilated funduscopy, 24-2 VF testing, and measurements of MT and RNFL thickness using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Spectralis®). After baseline examination, 24-2 VF testing and RNFL measurements were repeated every 6 months. Baseline inter-eye asymmetry was calculated for RNFL, MT, CDR, 24-2 mean defect (MD), and 24-2 pattern standard deviation (PSD) while intra-eye MT asymmetry was also calculated with the higher asymmetry eye used for analysis. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were utilized to examine relationships between baseline asymmetry parameters and longitudinal rates of RNFL and MD change over time.\n\nResults:\nSeventy-eight subjects met all inclusion criteria and were followed for 4.3 ±0.7 years (8.6 ±1.6 visits). In univariate linear regression analyses, rate of RNFL deterioration over time was related to baseline inter-eye MT asymmetry (r\n2\n=0.06, p=0.03), intra-eye MT asymmetry (r\n2\n=0.12, p=0.002), and inter-eye RNFL asymmetry (r\n2\n=0.04, p=0.04) but not baseline CDR, MD, or PSD asymmetry. Rate of MD change over time was related only to baseline inter-eye MT asymmetry (r\n2\n=0.14, p2=0.14)\n\nConclusion(s):\nHigher baseline MT and RNFL asymmetries are predictive of future rates of RNFL and MD deterioration and thus may be valuable for assessing baseline glaucoma risk.","title":"Associations Between Baseline Structural and Functional Asymmetry and Future Rates of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer and Visual Field Change in Glaucoma Suspects","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175033\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Suchitra Katiyar, Denise Pensyl, James Esposito, Michael Sullivan-Mee\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a leading risk factor in developing Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG); therefore, an accurate reading is essential with Goldmann (GAT), the standard of care. Central corneal thickness (CCT) is also used for initial analysis of diagnostic risk. It was previously concluded that reading CCT before GAT may influence the accuracy of the IOP reading, but the opposing sequence was inconclusive (Branch, 2007). This study aims to better understand how to achieve precise IOP measurements in a Glaucoma workup requiring both IOP and CCT.\n\nMethods:\n30 subjects with no history of refractive surgery or corneal trauma participated in this study. One drop of 0.5% Proparacaine and NaFl in sterile saline solution was placed OD. Sequence #1 was performed: GAT, CCT, and GAT. The same drops were placed OS and sequence #2 was performed: CCT, GAT, CCT. The PachPen was used to acquire CCT readings. Two paired t-Tests compared the outcome of the sequences.\n\nResults:\nTaking CCT before GAT had a statistically significant effect on the IOP reading (p=0.02449). The average pressure decreased 0.67 mmHg with sequence #1. Performing GAT before CCT did not affect the CCT reading (p=0.84).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThere is a statistically significant change in IOP with GAT when CCT is measured prior. Although statistical significance was found regarding this sequence, the clinical significance is negligible. It is also recognized that the number of times the cornea is touched when using the PachPen can vary greatly among physicians and patient types. A repeated study with a larger sample size may be warranted to further understand the relationship regarding the sequence of these procedures as standard protocol for glaucoma diagnosis.","title":"Sequence: Does it matter?

Subjects had ONH and macula OCTA (NIDEK AngioScan®), pERG, and VEP (Diopsys®) done. % vessel density (white/total pixels) was calculated from thresholded OCTA radial peripapillary plexus ONH (%VDrpc) and superficial plexus macula scans (%VDmac).

Classically, it is characterized by mobile “crystal” opacities within the vitreous cavity. In cases with lens subluxation or aphakia, the crystals can migrate to the anterior chamber. If this occurs, increased intraocular pressure (IOP) can result, which, if severe can lead to eye pain. By using topical ocular hypotensive agents, IOP control and patient symptoms can be improved.\n\nCase report:\n35 YO H M complained of a dull eye pain OS x 3 years. He had a significant history of a penetrating ocular trauma OS 6 years prior for which a pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy were performed. Clinical examination revealed BCVA 20/20 OD and hand motion at 8 feet OS. Slit lamp examination revealed the following OS: grade 2 conjunctival injection, corectopia, aphakia, grade 4+ pigmented crystals in the anterior chamber and vitreous. IOP was 38mmHg OS. Gonioscopy OS revealed extensive pigmentation inferior and crystals accumulated within the trabecular meshwork. Dilated fundus exam revealed retinal fibrosis, scaring and an epiretinal membrane consistent with a retinal detachment. The patient was diagnosed with OHTN secondary to SS. He was started on Simbrinza TID OS. One month later his IOP was 12mmHg OS with complete resolution of symptoms of eye pain on the topical agent. Due to insurance issues, the patient was switched to brimonidine 0.15% TID OS with successful lowering of the IOP and continued resolution of symptoms.\n\nDiscussion:\nSS is a rare vitreal condition. Uncommonly, the crystals of SS can migrate to the anterior chamber of the eye and lead to ocular hypertension. This occurs secondary to obstruction of aqueous outflow though the trabecular meshwork. By using an ocular hypotensive agent that decreases aqueous production, we were able to improve patient comfort by allowing for a reduction in IOP.","title":"Ocular Hypertension (OHTN) Associated with Synchysis Scintillans (SS) and Use of Topical Ocular Hypotensive Agents","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175022\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kimberley Poirier\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Yoga has been reported to improve physical health and quality of life, but previous studies have also shown that some yoga positions can cause an increase of the intraocular pressure (IOP) during positions in which the head is facing downwards. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate if there was any difference in IOP between different yoga positions.\n\nMethods:\n30 participants were recruited for this study (5 men and 25 women), age of 46.9 ± 10.3 years (Mean ± SD). All the participants were healthy and experienced yoga practitioners. Four yoga positions were used in the study: The Tower - Prasarita Padottanasana; Downward facing dog – Adho Mukha Svanasana; The Fish – Matsyasana; and the Headstand – Salamba Sirsasana. IOP was measured using an I-care Tonometer TA01i. The IOP was measured before the yoga positions, one minute into the positions, directly after, and two minutes after the positions.\n\nResults:\nThe baseline value of the IOP was 14.8 ± 2.7 mmHg. The mean value one minute into The Tower was 29.7 ± 4.7 mmHg, into the Downward facing dog 29.6 ± 5.6 mmHg, into Headstand 37.4 ± 8.0 mmHg, and into The Fish 18.3 ± 3.6 mmHg  (p < 0.05 for all compared with basaline). The IOP goes back to normal within 2 min after completion of the positions. A comparison between the intraocular pressure before and after the positions showed no significant difference.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe study showed that the intraocular pressure increases during all four yoga positions examined, but returns to normal immediately afterwards. It is unclear if this has any long-term effects on the eye, eg increased risk for glaucoma, and this needs to be further studied.","title":"The Impact of Four Yoga Positions on the Intraocular Pressure.","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175023\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Department of Medicine & Optometry, Linnaeus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Malin Ekström, Ingela Lundquist, Baskar Theagarayan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        County Hospital Kalmar, County Hospital Kalmar, Linnaeus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

This is a unique case presentation of unilateral nanophthalmos with glaucoma in a young patient.\n\nCase Report:\nA 19 year-old Caucasian female was referred for evaluation with self-reported history of congenital asymmetric eye size and a known history of unilateral elevated IOP.  Her medical history was unremarkable.  Pertinent examination findings in the 'small eye' over a series of visits were unilateral elevated IOP (max 36 mmHg), non-occludable angles, asymmetric corneal thickness without edema, and axial length difference of 1.74 mm with 2.00 D diffference in refractive error.  Optic cube OCT demonstrated NRR thinning with associated RNFL change.  Macular OCT revealed a shallow foveal pit and significantly increased subfoveal choroidal thickness. Combigan® BID OS was initiated.  After several months she self-discontinued Combigan® and experienced intermittent blur with haloes with segmental iris bowing and IOP of 45 mmHg.  After restarting meds, the symptoms abated.\n\nConclusion(s):\nNanophthalmic eyes have short axial length, hyperopia, small corneas, narrow angles, shallow anterior chamber, thickened sclera and macular hypoplasia, leaving them prone to development of angle closure in regards to small eye size with normal lenticular biometry.  Thickened sclera, as found in nanophthalmic eyes, may contribute to increased IOP via obstruction of the uveal-scleral aqueous outflow.  Additionally, scleral thickness may result in choroidal congestion with the potential to develop uveal effusion leading to devastating visual complication.  Threats to vision may be caught early if nanophthalmic eyes are frequently monitored.","title":"Atypical, Unilateral Nanophthalmos with Glaucoma in a Young Patient","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175024\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Heather McLeod\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Because faster rates of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and visual field (VF) deterioration have been linked to development of manifest glaucoma, this study was designed to identify clinical parameters that are associated with faster rates of RNFL and VF change so that these parameters can be used to aid glaucoma risk assessment.\n\nMethods:\nAll subjects were participating in a longitudinal glaucoma research study at the Albuquerque VA Medical Center and for this study were required to have ocular hypertension and/or an optic nerve appearance suspicious for glaucoma but no repeatable VF loss. Baseline examinations for all subjects included dilated funduscopy, 24-2 VF testing, and measurements of RNFL and macular thickness (MT) by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Spectralis®). Intraocular pressure (IOP), 24-2 VF, and RNFL measurements were then repeated every 6 months. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine relationships between clinical variables and rates of RNFL and 24-2 VF mean deviation (MD) change over time.\n\nResults:\nSeventy-eight subjects met all inclusion criteria and were followed for 4.3 ± 0.7 years. In univariate linear regression analyses, rate of RNFL deterioration was related to baseline age, inter-eye RNFL asymmetry, inter- and intra-eye MT asymmetry, mean IOP, and rate of MD change over time while rate of longitudinal MD decline was related to baseline RNFL thickness (thinner eye), inter-eye RNFL asymmetry, inter-eye MT asymmetry, and RNFL rate of change over time. In multivariate analyses, faster rate of RNFL decline was independently related to higher age, higher baseline intra-eye MT asymmetry, and higher rate of MD reduction over time (r2=0.35) while faster rate of MD decline over time was independently related to higher baseline inter-eye RNFL asymmetry and faster rate of RNFL reduction over time (r2=0.31).\n\nConclusion(s):\nLongitudinal rates of retinal nerve fiber layer and visual field deterioration in glaucoma suspects are related to each other as well as baseline structural asymmetry parameters.

Due to the degree of ectasia in these eyes, standard scleral lenses fit poorly and caused adverse complications. All required custom imprint scleral lenses to adequately fit the corneal profile and ensure proper ocular health.\n\nCase Report:\nFour eyes of three different patients with extreme ectasia after PKP surgery were first fit in standard commercially available scleral lenses. Best fit in all cases utilized large diameter lenses with high sagittal depth. Fit, vision, and corneal health were all evaluated after 2-3 months. All developed early corneal edema and reduced wear time, and one developed corneal neovascularization with standard scleral lenses. Patients were then refit with custom imprint scleral lenses based off elevation mapping. All patients showed resolved edema and increased wear time with full corneal clearance and appropriate limbal clearance.\n\nDiscussion:\nExtreme corneal ectasia needs sclerals that reflect their shape including: larger overall diameter, very deep sagittal depth and very steep limbal curves that match the steep limbal profile of the ectatic grafts. Standard scleral lenses cannot adequately vault the ectatic corneas without inducing excessive limbal clearance. Custom imprint scleral lenses allow the lens to match the shape of the very highly irregular and ectatic cornea, allowing proper vault throughout the cornea and limbus. This is essential in preventing complications like edema and neovascularization, and improving lens tolerance for patients.\n\nConclusion(s):\n\nA custom imprint scleral lens can be considered for any highly ectatic or irregularly shaped cornea that cannot be adequately fit with a standard scleral lens.","title":"Extreme Ectasia Requiring Custom Imprint Scleral Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175017\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Minnesota\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Recent interest in mapping the sclera and conjunctiva is proving that scleral shape is highly variable, and may explain the difficulty in fitting some patients with scleral lenses. A corneo-scleral topographical system was utilized to evaluate ocular shape of two patients. Custom multi-meridian back surface toric haptic scleral lenses were empirically designed to address the unusual scleral shape, which significantly deviated from a\nsin\n2\nbitoric curve with a periodicity of 180°.\n\nCase Reports:\n\nCase 1\nhad central corneal scarring due to recurrent herpes zoster and poor fitting scleral lenses, resulting in inferior decentration. Scleral topography showed a largely flat sclera with the exception of a 120° wide area of depression (~500µ deep) centered at 320°. A custom lens was designed to conform to this inferior depression which was well centered, comfortable, and provided better vision than previously obtained.\n\nCase 2\nhad advanced keratoconus with corneal ring implants and poor fitting scleral lenses, resulting in a recurrent corneal ulcer overlying bulging edge of the right ring implant, and lens intolerance. Scleral topography showed high scleral/conjunctival toricity, but with the steep axis inferiorly (270°) having a SAG 500µ greater than the steep axis superiorly (70°). A custom lens was designed to conform to this irregular scleral shape which had an optimal fit per OCT and slit lamp evaluation, was comfortable, and provided excellent acuity.\n\nConclusion/Discussion:\nThe novel topography device and innovative software technology accurately mapped both corneal and scleral irregularities, empirically designed the scleral lenses, and accurately predicted the fit and fluorescein patterns. These virtually fit scleral lenses provided both patients with good comfort and vision they did not experience with previous lens designs.","title":"Management of Corneo-Scleral Irregularities with Virtually Designed Custom Multi-Meridian Scleral Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175018\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Boaz Schwartz, Greg DeNaeyer, Donald Sanders\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Mount Airy Medical Eye Center, Arena Eye Surgeons, Visionary Optics\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

They were fitted with a central clearance of 400 um at insertion. One eye was randomly assigned to be fitted with a non-preserved gel solution of carboxymethylcellulose, while the other was inserted with non-preserved saline. Measurements of clearance in 3 locations were taken (OCT) at baseline, every 30 min up to 1h30 post insertion and every 2 h thereafter up to 6h00 of wear. A two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (liquids × times) was used to test central, nasal and temporal fluid thickness.\n\nResults:\nFollowing 6 h of wear, the 18 mm lens had a mean central settling of 70.0 ± 9.8 μm, 36.7 ± 9.8 μm of which occurred within the first 30 min of wear.

However, a paired comparison concluded to a significant difference between mean nasal settling (41.4 μm) and temporal settling (20.4 μm).\n\nConclusion(s):\nWith respect to the lens studied, current results suggest that practitioners can evaluate the lens 30 min post insertion and can estimate the amount of fluid that will remain after lens stabilization by doubling the value obtained initially. The use of non-preserved saline or non-preserved more viscous solution to fill the lens does not influence its settling.","title":"Predicting End-of-Day Clearance and Effect of Solution Viscosity in Scleral Lens Wear Over Time","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175009\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Langis Michaud\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        N/A\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Clinicians routinely use biomicroscopy to assess vasculature beneath the landing of a scleral lens, yet there have been no studies, to our knowledge, to investigate this critical interaction in greater depth.\n\n\nMethods:\nOne healthy, CL-nave subject was scanned using a commercially-available AngioVue OCTA system with anterior segment adapter (Optovue, Inc) and split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation algorithm. Volume scans of 6mm x 6mm were performed on the nasal and temporal midline of the right and left eyes prior to lens wear, immediately after application, after 30min of wear, 4hr of wear, immediately after lens removal, and 30min after removal. Gaze position control and vessel tracking ensured consistent regional imaging. Image segmentation was performed to capture vasculature from anterior conjunctiva to posterior sclera, as well as to localize regions of vascular non-perfusion. Slit lamp photography was performed at each time point for visual comparison to OCTA scans.\n\n\nResults:\nLocal regions of reduced perfusion beneath scleral lens landing zones were visualized with OCTA at all time points of lens wear. Reduced perfusion did not necessarily coincide with the clinical appearance of vessel blanching. After lens removal, these regions of reduced perfusion began to recover, and had returned nearly to baseline by 30min after removal. On further image segmentation, all vessels that demonstrated reduced perfusion with scleral lens application were anterior to the episclera.\n\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe long term effects of scleral lens wear on ocular physiology remain poorly understood. This study begins to shed light on bloodflow changes previously undetected by biomicroscopy alone. These changes carry potential implications for long term health of ocular tissues and normal physiologic function such as aqueous outflow.","title":"What Lies Beneath: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) of Microvascular Changes in Short Term Scleral Lens Wear","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175010\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        EyeHealth Northwest\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Yan Li\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Casey Eye Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Statistical comparisons were calculated using Chi-Square analysis.\n\nResults:\nThe survey was completed by 146 individuals (8%). Contact lenses were fit by 93% of the sample, and of those, 94% fit GPs. Rinsing GPs with tap water in office was reported by 57%, but only 35% report rinsing GPs in front of patients. Seventy-four percent of those surveyed educate patients to avoid rinsing GPs with tap water. The most common solution type for corneal lenses was a two-step system (39%) with peroxide being the most common for sclerals (52%). For storage cases, 50% recommend no water use when cleaning storage cases and 88% recommend a replacement schedule, with 82% of those listing 1-3 months as the optimal replacement interval. Practitioners who reported rinsing GPs with tap water (n=65) were more likely to report that this behavior has no effect on the risk of infection compared to those who reported not rinsing with water (n=45) (p < 0.001). There was a similar relationship regarding risk perception with distilled water (p=0.01). When asked about GP solution instructions, 75% reported that manufacturers should consider modifying the rinsing step instructions. Those who reported avoidance of GP tap water rinse were more likely to support modifications to product instructions (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nPractitioners perceive that rinsing GPs with tap water increases the risk of infection and also report that they educate their patients to refrain from a tap water rinse. However, a disparity exists between risk perception and clinical practice, with over half of those surveyed rinsing GPs with tap water.","title":"Gas Permeable Contact Lenses and Water Exposure - Practice Patterns of a Sample of American Academy of Optometry Members","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175011\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Heidi Wagner, Nicky Lai, Aaron Zimmerman\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Traditional 6.0mm OZD lenses are currently used for both of these purposes, yet provides sub-optimal results in both instances. This study aims to determine the amount of peripheral blur with each lens design and demonstrate that a smaller OZD produces more peripheral blur than a larger OZD. More blur in the periphery may be useful to induce a stronger myopia control effect in children, where as less blur in the periphery is likely to improve image quality and reduce aberrations in adult wearers.\n\nMethods:\nSeven subjects with myopia -1.00 to -6.00 D and < -1.75D astigmatism in both eyes were recruited from the Class of 2018 Pacific University College of Optometry. Subjects were fit with a 5.4mm OZD lens on the right eye, and 6.8mm OZD lens on left eye, with next morning, 1-week, and two-week follow-up appointments. Using corneal topography, baseline and two-week corneal dioptric power was obtained for each eye centrally, and at a radius of 2mm and 3mm in 8 meridians.\n\nResults:\nThe amount of blur in the periphery is given by the difference in power from central to peripheral cornea. The smaller 5.4 OZD induced more blur than baseline by 2.36 + 0.62 D, P < 0.001, at 2mm, and by 3.55 + 1.35 D, P < 0.001, at 3mm peripherally. The larger 6.8 OZD induced 0.76 + 0.65 D, P < 0.05, peripheral blur at 2mm and 3.04 + 1.03 D, P < 0.001, at 3mm compared to baseline. The blur induced was significantly different between the two lenses in the 2mm radius P < 0.005, but not in the 3mm radius P=0.82.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis study shows a modern aspheric ortho-k lens design with a 5.4 OZD meant for myopia control that provides increased peripheral defocus and a larger 6.8mm OZD meant for adult ortho-k lens wear that produces less peripheral blur, which may reduce aberrations that negatively impact vision.","title":"Modern Aspheric Orthokeratology Lens Designs of Varying Optical Zone Diameter","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175012\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lindsey Rosencrans, Patrick Caroline\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University, Pacific University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Treatments for amblyopia include occluding or penalizing the non-amblyopic eye. Inexpensive adhesive patches are typically used to treat amblyopia because they are easy to apply and remove. Nevertheless, some children refuse or cannot wear adhesive patches. In such circumstances, occlusion contact lenses can be used as an alternative treatment for amblyopia. This case report will discuss the novel use of a high plus scleral gas permeable contact lens (SGP) for treatment of anisometropic amblyopia (AA) in unilateral infantile aphakia.\nCase Report:\nA 12-month-old Caucasian female presented for fitting of a contact lens to correct for aphakia in her left eye due to removal of a congenital cataract. Her aphakia was successfully corrected with a SGP. The patient was not compliant with adhesive patch occlusion therapy for treatment of AA. Clear high-plus-powered contact lenses can optically penalize the sound eye. Thus, the patient’s spare aphakic SGP was placed on the sound right eye for optical occlusion. Parents experienced with aphakic contact lenses usually welcome this option because they are already familiar with lens handling. One success with scleral lenses that parents appreciate is that the child is less likely to rub the lens out. If the aphakic lens fits well on the non-amblyopic eye, the same design can be used for both eyes. This patient was compliant with occlusion therapy to treat AA using a high plus SGP.\nConclusion(s):\nFor children who refuse or cannot wear an adhesive patch to treat amblyopia, high plus SGP is an alternative for optical occlusion/penalization of the sound eye. Occlusion high plus SGP should be considered for amblyopic children who are not compliant with traditional therapies.","title":"Scleral Lens Occlusion in Pediatrics as Amblyopia Prevention","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175013\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Amy Belloli-Conner, Melanie Frogozo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Contact Lens Institute of San Antonio, The Contact Lens Institute of San Antonio\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Designing scleral lenses to fit over or around irregularities poses unique fitting issues. A new corneo- scleral topography device and software is now able to accurately map these irregularities, quantify the size and location, and custom design scleral lenses with notches or lift areas that will fit over or around them, decreasing chair time and lens remakes.\n\nCase Report:\nCase 1\n- nasal pingeucula, history of Salzmans Degeneration resulted in both corneal and scleral irregularities. This system designed a scleral lens with an area of lift over the pinguecula, giving the patient a comfortable, centered lens with J2 OS at near.\nCase 2 -\npost LASIK with corneal scars. Scleral mapping showed nasal pingueculae OU. Scleral lenses were designed from software with nasal areas of lift to vault the pingueculas. The lenses were rotationally stabilized with back surface haptic toricity that was measured from scleral topography. The patient was comfortable with the lenses with 20/40 vision OU.\nCase 3 -\npenetrating keratoplasty OS resulted in significant corneal irregularity. An elevated paralimbal conjunctival bleb complicated the fit. A scleral lens was designed using scleral topography having back surface haptic toricity and a lifted edge that vaulted the bleb without complication. The patient was 20/40 with full-time comfortable wear.\n\nConclusion(s):\nNew mapping technology identifies and quantifies size, shape and location of scleral irregularities, suggests a custom scleral lens design, and predicts the fit of that scleral design. The software is able to “cut out” the elevated area in the virtual fit allowing more accurate assessment of base curve(BC) to achieve desired central clearance. Removal of the elevation can change BC by 10D. Information this device/software combination provides is critical in successful fitting of unusual scleral irregularities.","title":"Simplifying Scleral Lens Fitting in the Presence of  Localized Elevations with a New Corneo-Scleral Topography System: Notches and Lifts","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175014\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SynergEyes, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Greg DeNaeyer, Donald Sanders\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Visionary Optics, Visionary Optics\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Due to an Arg124His mutation in transforming growth factor β-induced gene, GCD2 presents clinically as a combination of granular and lattice dystrophies: superficial hyaline granular deposits in the anterior corneal stroma and occasionally amyloid lattice lesions in the deep stroma. When a stromal haze develops between these deposits, significant vision impairment can occur.\n\nCase Report:\nA 77-year old Korean male was initially seen by the USC Roski Eye Institute Cornea Service and then referred to our Optometry Service for a contact lens fitting to avoid surgical intervention. OCT imaging revealed superficial and deep stromal deposits with haze between opacities characteristic of GCD2, suggesting the need for DALK if vision could not be improved. Ultimately, he was fit with a scleral lens in both eyes, and vision improved from 20/60-2 OD and 20/60-2 OS with spectacles to 20/30-2 OD and 20/40-2 OS with scleral lenses.\n\nDiscussion:\nManagement and visual prognosis of GCD2 can be challenging depending on depth and size of the deposits. Surgical treatment options include PTK for superficial deposits and DALK or PKP for deeper deposits, though both have high risk for recurrence. Therefore, rigid gas permeable contact lenses can be a good alternative to mask the irregular astigmatism induced by these corneal opacities. Moreover, patients with GCD2 are at an increased risk for recurrent corneal erosions when Bowman’s layer is involved, so the use of scleral lenses can optimize corneal health while also providing an ideal spherical refractive surface.\n\nConclusion(s):\nScleral contact lenses can be a great option for vision correction in patients with Granular Corneal Dystrophy Type 2 to avoid surgical intervention.","title":"Scleral Lenses for the Visual Rehabilitation of Granular Corneal Dystrophy Type 2","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175015\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

With the increased number of patients using this modality for vision correction the number and variety of complications have also increased. As with any treatment, possible side effects and complications from scleral contact lens use must be discussed and best practices established for the safety and wellbeing of the patient.\n\nCase Report:\nA 68 year old Hispanic male presented for a follow-up on a recent scleral contact lens fit. The patient had a prior history of a Penetrating Keratoplasty and PCIOL secondary to trauma in the right eye over 30 years prior. The patient was fit in a 16.0mm Zen Lens with a 4500 SAG and 7.60 BC and -2.00 SPH Power and was able to achieve 20/30 vision in the eye. The patient had an apical clearance of the contact lens of about 200 microns and good limbal clearance after 1 hour of wear.\n\nAt the follow-up exam a large sub-epithelial corneal bullae was noted and specular microscopy showed a markedly decreased endothelial cell count. Scleral contact lens use was discontinued and the patient was started on Muro 128 5% (Sodium Chloride Hypertonicity 5%) ointment QID OD. The corneal bullae resolved completely over the following week with no complications or sequelae.

While scleral contact lenses are an effective tool for helping our patients achieve clear comfortable vision, more research is needed to determine in which patients scleral contact lenses might be contraindicated.","title":"Traumatic Corneal Bulla in a Post Penetrating Keratoplasty Patient Wearing a Mini Scleral Contact","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175016\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        US Army\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Christian Olson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        USArmy\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Scleral Lens Education Society members were invited to participate via e-mail, links to the survey were posted on the Scleral Lens Fitters Facebook page and were included in two monthly online newsletters. Fitters were asked to provide information about their most recently evaluated established scleral lens patient (history of ≥ 6 months of lens wear). We describe demographics of scleral lens wearers, indications for wear, and lens designs prescribed.\n\nResults:\nWe received 376 responses.  Mean patient age (n=339) was 44 ± 14 years (range 9-86 years). Male gender was reported in 62% of patients (n=352). Primary indications for scleral lens wear (n=312) were corneal irregularity (84%), ocular surface disease (7%) and correction of refractive error (5%). Median lens diameter was 16 mm (range 10-23 mm) for both right (n=207) and left (n=212) eyes. Single vision lenses were prescribed for 97% of right eyes (n=207) and 98% of left eyes (n=211).  Right lenses (n=201) incorporated spherical (69%), toric (28%) and wavefront-corrected (3%) optics.  Left lenses (n=207) incorporated spherical (70%), toric (28%) or wavefront-corrected (2%) optics.  Right lenses (n=201) featured spherical (61%), toric (28%), quadrant-specific (8%) or impression-based (3%) haptics.  Left lenses (n=207) featured spherical (63%), toric (27%), quadrant-specific (7%) or impression-based (2%) haptics.\n\nConclusion(s):\nScleral lenses are most commonly prescribed for management of corneal irregularity. Median lens diameter prescribed is 16 mm. Most scleral lenses feature single vision optical correction, and a majority of lenses prescribed feature spherical optical power and haptic designs.","title":"Scleral Lenses in Current Ophthalmic Practice Evaluation: Patient Demographics, Indications and Lens Designs","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175003\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Mayo Clinic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Cherie Nau, Jennifer Harthan, Amy Nau, Jenny Fogt, Joe Barr, Ellen Shorter\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Mayo Clinic, Illinois College of Optometry, Korb and Associates, The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry, University of Illinois Chicago\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Slit beam comparison of the tear reservoir to the lens thickness was most commonly used to determine central clearance (78%) and limbal clearance (66%). The initial parameter considered in determining a diagnostic lens was: diameter (40%), base curve (35%) and sagittal depth (24%). Central clearance was deemed excessive if >300µm (34%) or >400µm (34%). Central clearance was deemed insufficient if200µm (42%) or 300µm (26%). Limbal clearance was deemed insufficient if <100µm (14%); 50µm (28%); or touch (52%).  Acceptable vascular blanching/compression was none (46%) or 1 clock dial/30° (42%).  Acceptable conjunctival billowing was none (24%); 1 clock dial/30° (25%); 1 quadrant (29%).\n\nConclusion(s):\nTopography and slit beam assessment are widely used by scleral lens practitioners in this sample, however, there is limited consensus on what constitutes an acceptable scleral lens fit.

We tested if 1) blebs appear after wearing scleral lenses of different clearances and, 2) blebs better indicate corneal edema than pachymetry.\n\nMethods:\n21 subjects were fitted with 2 similar scleral lenses except for target clearances of 200 and 400 µm (SL200, SL400). SL were worn on one eye for 25 minutes, the other eye was a control. Corneal thickness (CT), endothelial images of both eyes, before and after lens wear as well as post-lens fluid thickness (PFT) were obtained by specular microscopy and OCT. Two observers blind to the experimental condition checked for the number of blebs (NB) in the images. We compared the differences 1) in NB between both lenses with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test and 2) in CT before and after wearing SL200 and SL400 with a repeated measure ANOVA.\n\nResults:\nOne observation reported the occurrence of bleb in 126 situations without scleral lenses. 9 and 14 subjects had at least one bleb after wearing SL200 and SL400, respectively. Median NB after wearing SL200 and SL400 were significantly different (SL200: 0.00; SL400: 1.00; p = 0.02). CT increased from 561 ± 26 and 563 ± 26 to 577 ± 26 and 575 ± 24 µm, after wearing SL200 and SL400. Time had a significant effect (p < 0.000) on corneal thickness, but not clearance. PFT under SL200 and 400 was 200 ± 42 and 418 ± 59 µm, respectively.\n\nConclusion(s):\nObservation of transient endothelial changes after wearing scleral lenses for 25 minutes appears a more sensitive parameter of hypoxia than corneal thickness monitoring since SL400 induced more blebs in more subjects than SL200, despite similar increased thickness. However bleb occurred in only about half of the sample. This study provides the first physiological proof that oxygen levels are decreased under scleral lenses with excessive clearance.","title":"Do Endothelial Blebs Better Predict Corneal Edema than Pachometry after the Wear of Scleral Lenses with Different Clearances?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175005\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ecole d 'Optometrie\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Josiane Rancourt, Marc Melillo, Langis Michaud\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Universite of Montreal, Universite of Montreal, Universite of Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

We compared: 1) bleb relative surface (BRS) during the wear of scleral lenses fitted with different clearances and 2) the surface of blebs and endothelial cells visible in the same specular reflection.\n\nMethods:\n21 subjects were fitted with 2 identical scleral lenses except for clearances of 200 and 400 μm (SL200 and SL400). During the two visits, SL were worn on one eye for 25 minutes, the other eye was a control. The endothelium was photographed with a specular microscope before and after wear. A “blind” observer identified cells or blebs in the images and processed them with image J to get their surface (in pixels). The difference in BRS over the sampled area between SL200 and SL400 was tested for significance with a Wilcoxon matched signed-rank test. Paired t tests were used to assess differences between cell and bleb areas.\n\nResults:\nBlebs occurred in 43 and 67% of subjects after the wear of SL200 and SL400, respectively. The difference in BRS observed after SL200 and SL400 wear was not significantly different (Medians: SL200: 0.00, SL400: 0.27%, p = 0.074). The difference between bleb and cell areas (blebs: 181.8 ± 17.5; cells: 228.9 ± 18.9 pixels; n=14) was significant. The average cell area of 377 µm\n2\nof this sample suggests that the average bleb area is 300 µm\n2\n.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIncreased hypoxia, as obtained with a scleral lens with a high clearance did not statistically change the BRS. This result might be due to a lack of power. The surface area of blebs was smaller than the area of cells. Although we cannot rule out that our detection algorithm has a different effect on the measurement of the surface of a bleb or a cell, this result suggests that cells who become enough edematous to present the bleb phenomenon are smaller than their neighbour endothelial cells.","title":"Surface Area of Endothelial Blebs and Cells after the Wear of Scleral Lenses of Different Clearances","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175006\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ecole d 'Optometrie\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Josiane Robillard, Josiane Rancourt, Marc Melillo, Langis Michaud\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Université de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Université de Montréal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Contact lens comfort and handling were also assessed.\n\nMethods:\nThree geographically diverse locations administered surveys to KCN subjects who habitually wore SGP or CGP lenses in the absence of corneal surgery, other conditions impacting vision, or piggyback lens systems. Severity classification of KCN was based on simulated keratometry using the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus study group’s grading scheme. Outcome measures included the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) and questions on lens comfort and handling. Comparisons were assessed using one-tailed Wilcoxon tests.\n\nResults:\nThirty-five KCN subjects were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference in overall NEI-VFQ-25 scores between SGP and CGP groups (p=0.18). The greatest differences in NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores between SGP and CGP wearers were found for the dependency upon other persons (p=0.01), general vision (p=0.07) and driving (p=0.07) subscales, with SGP scoring better in all three subscales. No statistically significant differences were found between SGP and CGP for the overall score or the subscale scores when subjects were grouped based on KCN severity (all p > 0.05).  End of the day comfort was significantly better for SGP wearers (p=0.009). Difficulty with lens application and removal was similar between groups (p=0.30).\n\nConclusion(s):\nKCN persons wearing SGP and CGP have similar VRQoL. The benefits of  superior comfort and vision with SGP lenses may not extend to superior VRQoL in keratoconus. Future cross-over studies may further elucidate differences in VRQoL and help optometrists envisage contact lens options that optimize VRQoL in this important population.","title":"Vision-Related Quality of Life in Keratoconus: Scleral versus Corneal Gas Permeable Lens Correction","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175007\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Dawn Meyer, Stephanie Cox, Melissa Barnett, Pete Kollbaum\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana  University School of Optometry, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optomtery, University of California Davis Eye Center, Indiana  University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

As modern scleral lenses are still relatively new, there are many unknowns about the effect a scleral lens has on the cornea. The purpose of this study is to measure the corneal changes in scleral lens neophytes with normal corneas over the course of 8 hours.\n\nMethods:\n\n16 healthy subjects between the ages of 18 and 40 who had never worn gas permeable lenses, and had no ocular disease or refractive surgery were recruited for participation in the study. Subjects were fit for scleral lenses using normal clinical procedures and returned for a second visit where they wore the lenses for approximately 8 hours. Corneal thickness and vault measurements using iVue Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography were obtained every 2 hours. Sirius Pulsar corneal tomographer measurements were also used to measure corneal thickness, curvature, and aberrations before and after lens wear.\n\nResults:\nThe average corneal curvature (K) value measured for 30 eyes flattened an average of 0.07D, which was statistically significant (p=0.02). Average corneal thickness measured for 26 eyes increased 4.7 µm (0.8%) with the largest increases found in the inferior central cornea which increased 5.5 µm (1.0%) (p < 0.01). Decreases in vault were measured for 24 eyes in the first and second 2 hour periods of wear with statistically larger changes in the first 2 hours (p < 0.01). Eyes with a greater coefficient of variation for the vault measurements showed a trend towards greater changes in corneal thickness (p=0.04). No significant changes in corneal aberrations were noted.\n\nConclusion(s):\n\nSignificant changes were noted in the average K values for normal neophyte subjects wearing scleral contact lenses for 8 hours and an increase in variance was found with longer wear times. The cornea was found to swell significantly, but variation between subjects suggests that other factors are at play.","title":"Corneal Changes Associated with Scleral Contact Lens Wear in Normal Subjects","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175008\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Joshua Baker, Ngoc Le, Tammy Nguyen, Miae Kwon, Madiha Tehseen, Florencia Yeh\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Arizona College of Optometry Midwestern University, Arizona College of Optometry Midwestern University, Arizona College of Optometry Midwestern University, Arizona College of Optometry Midwestern University, Arizona College of Optometry Midwestern University, Arizona College of Optometry Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Evaluation of vasculature with fluorescein angiography can help identify mild ODE, however, OCTA has the advantage of being non-invasive. The goal of this study was to quantify and determine the location of vascular changes in ODE using OCTA.\n\n\nMethods:\nVolumetric OCTA scans were acquired from 14 subjects with ODE (12 confirmed papilledema, 2 papilledema suspects) and 22 control subjects; one eye was randomly selected for analysis. OCT data were exported, and a custom program identified Bruch’s membrane (BM) opening (BMO). BMO points were superimposed on contrast-enhanced, full-thickness OCTA images (.tif) with standard internal limiting membrane (ILM) to BM segmentation and fit with an ellipse. Concentric ellipses at eccentricities of 500 µm and 1000 µm were created. Two annular zones were analyzed for pixel intensity (0-255): 1) BMO to 500 µm (Angio500) and 2) 500 to 1000 µm (Angio1000). 150 µm superficial and deep retinal slabs, referenced to the ILM (ILM150) and BM (BM150), respectively, were created to determine the location of enhanced OCTA signal in ODE.\n\nResults:\nAngio500 pixel intensity was greater in the ODE group (146 ± 9.66) compared with controls (137 ± 8.87, p = 0.006), however, there was no difference in Angio1000 pixel intensity between groups. 11 ODE subjects exhibited peripapillary hyper-intensity (PPHI) on full-thickness OCTA images. In all cases, PPHI was present in BM150 but not ILM150 images.\n\nConclusion(s):\nVascular changes in ODE appear to occur adjacent to the optic nerve head and manifest as PPHI on OCTA. These changes are not apparent in the superficial retina but rather present in deeper retinal layers. OCTA PPHI, combined with other clinical data, may be a useful objective finding for the diagnosis and management of ODE.","title":"Quantification and Localization of Peripapillary Vascular Changes in Optic Disc Edema Using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170045\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Han Cheng, Jorge Mendoza, Rosa Tang, Laura Frishman, Nimesh Patel\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, MS Eye CARE, University of Houston College of Optometry MS Eye CARE, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E354B\n                    \n            |#|"}

A biomarker for tissue oxygenation could include the distance between an arteriole or venule and the nearest capillaries, with greater distances indicating potential ischemia. We investigated this distance in normal subjects who are not high myopes, comparing arterioles and venules, and also sex.\n\nMethods:\nImages of paired arterioles, venules, and their surrounding capillaries were acquired using OCTA (Spectralis HRA+OCT, Spectralis Eye Explorer version 1.9.14.0, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) in 5 male and female age-matched (25.2 vs 25.6 yr) normal subjects with refractive errors < + 3.00D. The distances from the edge of either the arteriole or venule to the middle of the adjacent capillaries (perfusion distance) within the superficial vascular plexus (boundary of inner limiting membrane to inner plexiform layer) were measured using Photoshop. We computed the mean distance, SD and coefficient of variation of the distances.\n\nResults:\nThe distance was greater between the arteriole to the nearest capillaries (78.0 + 28.5 μm) than for the paired venule to the nearest capillaries (43.3 + 15.4 μm). Males had larger perfusion distances than females for arterioles (84.2 vs 72.0μm) but not for venules (42.2 vs 44.1 μm) (ANOVA 2 way interaction, p = 0.001). Males did not differ from females for axial length or arteriole diameter. The coefficient of variation for perfusion for arterioles was 0.055 for females and 0.048 for males for vessels of 31.6 and 28.3 μm, respectively.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn the normal retina, the perfusion distance between the capillaries and arterioles is greater than for venules, particularly for males. The perfusion distance may serve as a biomarker for diabetic and other retinal vascular diseases in which ischemia occurs.","title":"Comparison of Difference in Perfusion Distances Between Capillaries and Arterioles or Venules using OCTA","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170043\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kaitlyn Sapoznik, Ann Elsner\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E354B\n                    \n            |#|"}

ClearCare is buffered with phosphonic acid with the micro-filtered hydrogen peroxide, Pluronic 17R4, and sodium chloride. ScleralFil is buffered with boric acid, sodium borate in combination with the sodium chloride in purified water.\n\nMethods:\nWe selected three different vials from three different production lot numbers of each preservative-free saline and one production lot number of the ScleralFil due to production availability. The neutralized ClearCare Solution had been neutralized for at least six hours within four days of the testing. The testing with the pH meter was done by first calibrating the pH meter using standard buffered solutions of 4.0 pH and 7.0 pH. The graduated cylinders and the pH meter electrode were rinsed with deionized water and were blotted with KimTech wipes to insure sterility and prevent static charges which could skew the readings.\n\nResults:\nWe found the range of our initial four preservative-free salines to be from 4.50 pH units to 7.52 pH units. Of the initial testing, the ClearCare had the least variability followed by ScleralFil and then LacriPure. The pH of LacriPure was much lower than the claimed 7.0 pH units due to the lack of the buffer during the manufacturing process.\n\nConclusion(s):\nWe found a statistically significant difference between the pH of the four preservative-free salines tested. The most acidic samples were Modudose Saline and AddiPak Unit Dose Vials which also had the widest ranges and the largest standard deviations which could be expected due the lack of FDA approval for scleral lens use. Neutralized ClearCare Solution and ScleralFil were the only preservative-free salines which were buffered and whose results were within the pH range of ocular comfort.","title":"Is Buffered Better?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175001\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Julie DeKinder\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Missouri- St. Louis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

We compared how well the groups of points used in the Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT) derived from nerve fiber layer (NFL) distributions detect glaucomatous VF defects (VFDs) compared to those derived from contrast sensitivity isocontours (CSIs) found using pattern recognition.\n\nMethods:\nThe Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) was used in full threshold mode to measure thresholds across the 30-2 test grid using the Goldmann size III target in 60 normal subjects. Thresholds were converted to a 50 year old equivalent observer to generate multiple group-averaged data sets.  Data sets were converted to pixel values and analyzed using unsupervised classification (ISODATA or k-means clustering: PCI, Canada).  We derived CSIs (delineating points with the same contrast sensitivity) separated with an accuracy of >96%. We then compared clusters of points using the conventional GHT with those derived from the CSIs in 50 VFs of 27 early-to-moderate (mean deviation (MD) > -6 dB) glaucoma patients, and present a model for performing asymmetry analysis to detect VFDs.\n\nResults:\nThe clusters of points used by the GHT derived from NFL distribution patterns and those derived from CSIs are discordant with few areas showing similar distribution patterns. This is expected given the different underlying methods used to derive the clusters. Asymmetry analysis using grouped points with the same CSI within each hemifield detected more VFDs (64%) compared to that reported using the HFA GHT (38% of the glaucoma cohort). A subset of 5 VFs from 5 eyes with moderate glaucoma (-6 dB ≤ MD < -12 dB) confirmed that the model performed just as well with more severe VFDs (100%).\n\nConclusion(s):\nCSIs derived using pattern recognition analysis provides a framework for new methods of grouping test locations to improve detection of glaucomatous VFDs in early stages of the disease.","title":"Pattern Recognition Reveals Unique Sensitivity Patterns Useful for a Hemifield Test Analysis in Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170040\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jack Phu, Sieu Khuu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health SOVS UNSW, SOVS UNSW\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E354A\n                    \n            |#|"}

While effective therapeutics exist, early detection of RGC loss remains elusive owing to our inability to observe RGCs and their pathogenesis in the living human eye. Here we show that using advanced imaging technology these cells can be visualized and quantified, and thus the potential for direct detection of cell loss.\n\nMethods:\nWe used high-resolution optical coherence tomography equipped with adaptive optics (AO-OCT) to acquire 1.5°x1.5° volume images along the horizontal meridian of the macula from four subjects free of ocular disease. In post processing, volumes were registered in 3D with subcellular accuracy and averaged to increase image contrast of ganglion cell layer (GCL) somas. The 3D spatial coordinates of the GCL soma centers were marked and used to determine soma stack thickness, diameter, and density.\n\nResults:\nMore than 40,000 GCL somas were counted in the four subjects at 26 different locations. The high resolution of AO-OCT enabled visualization of the layering of GCL somas in depth, necessary for accurate measurements of cell size and density, and observations of the arrangement of somas through the entire GCL.

This study was therefore designed to compare relationships between glaucomatous VF loss measured by 10-2 and 24-2 VF tests and QOL measurements.\n\nMethods:\nAll subjects were participating in a longitudinal glaucoma research study at the Albuquerque VA Medical Center, and for this investigation, were diagnosed either primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or glaucoma suspect (GS). POAG subjects had glaucomatous optic neuropathy with repeatable VF loss while GS subjects had ocular hypertension and/or optic nerve appearance that was suspicious for glaucoma but no repeatable VF loss. The NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire, a Rasch-validated QOL survey instrument consisting of 25 questions that probe various aspects of everyday visual function, was administered to each subject and cumulative QOL scores were calculated for use in statistical analyses. Each subject completed 24-2 and 10-2 VF testing within 6 months of completing the NEI-VFQ-25. Relationships between QOL scores and both the better and worse eye as defined by mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) on the 24-2 and 10-2 VF tests were investigated using pair-wise tests and linear regression analyses.\n\nResults:\nMedian (interquartile range) values for the POAG (n=72) and GS (n=54) groups for better-eye 24-2 MD were -0.98 (-2.83, 0.09) and 0.39 (-0.01, 1.09) respectively while worse-eye 24-2 MD values were -4.61 (-8.17, -2.11) and -0.25 (-0.71, 0.44) respectively. Despite relatively mild VF loss in the sample, cumulative QOL scores were significantly lower in POAG vs. GS groups (87.69 vs. 93.46, P < 0.001). In regression analyses, the best predictor of QOL score was better-eye 24-2 MD (r\n2\n= 0.17, p < 0.001) followed by better-eye 10-2 MD (r\n2\n= 0.14, p < 0.001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nAlthough POAG subjects in this study were characterized by mild VF loss overall, QOL scores were significantly reduced in this group compared to the GS group, suggesting that POAG impacts QOL even in early stages of disease. Better-eye 24-2 MD and 10-2 MD appear to provide important information regarding quality of life in glaucoma.","title":"Quality of Life in Glaucoma: Relative Effects of 10-2 and 24-2 Visual Field Loss.","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170041\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Denise Pensyl, Suchitra Katiyar, James Esposito, Nimesh Patel, Michael Sullivan-Mee\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VAMC, Albuquerque VAMC, Albuquerque VAMC, Albuquerque VAMC, Albuquerque VAMC\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E354A\n                    \n            |#|"}

Previous OCTA studies in RP indicate reduced deep and superficial capillary plexus densities, which correlated with mfERG results. It is currently unknown whether OCTA changes relate to other aspects of visual function, if there are other regional variations, and the repeatability in RP.\n\nMethods:\nETDRS visual acuity (VA), Goldmann visual fields (GVF) and OCTA results without significant artifacts or defects were obtained in 14 eyes of 7 RP subjects (ages 36-56 years; VA 20/20-700) using the Zeiss AngioPlex. The 3x3 images were analyzed for the average vessel density (total length of vessels) and perfusion density (total area) within the central and inner ETDRS zones using multilevel models to account for correlations between eyes.\n\nResults:\nAverage vessel density for central and/or inner zones was highly significantly correlated with perfusion density (p < 0.001). Reduced perfusion density for central and inner zones combined was significantly correlated with decreased VA (95% CI: -0.11, -0.04; p < 0.001), but not GVF log retinal area for the V4e or III4e isopters (p = 0.72 or 0.92). Perfusion density was significantly greater on average in the nasal vs. temporal zone (95% CI: 0.1,0. 015; p = 0.01). The Zeiss algorithm was able to measure the foveal avascular zone area in only half of the subjects. The within-session test-retest reliability for perfusion density was 22.9% for the central and inner areas combined, although it was greater (37.8%) for the central zone only. Reduced signal strengths of 8 vs. 9 or 9 vs. 10 did not significantly influence the perfusion density values within-eyes (0.03; 95% CI: -0.008, 0.07; p = 0.11).\n\nConclusion(s):\nLevel of VA loss in RP was associated with macular perfusion density, which had the greatest reduction temporally, and exhibited good test repeatability.","title":"OCT Angiography (OCTA) Findings in Retinitis Pigmentosa Patients","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170044\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ava Bittner\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E354B\n                    \n            |#|"}

While the pupil re-dilates faster after a single pulse of similar red light, indicating insufficient melanopsin activation, we have observed that re-dilation rates slow after repeated light exposures. Using flashing red and blue light stimuli, we investigated the effect of irradiance and stimulus color on the time-course for this progressive change in pupil re-dilation kinetics.\n\nMethods:\nTwelve (27.6 ± 1.7 yrs; 42% male) participated in 2 sessions of 3 tests. Each 2 min test was preceded by 20 min dark adaptation and consisted of a bright (session 1; 10^13 phot/s/cm^2) or dim (session 2; 10^11 phot/s/cm^2), flickering (0.1 Hz) stimulus of either 625 nm (RED), 470 nm (BLUE), or red-blue alternating (ALT) light. The rate of pupil re-dilation after every pulse (‘pupil decay’) was normalized to the mean pupil decay of session 1’s bright blue stimulus, a test condition known to be suprathreshold for melanopsin activation. Normalized pupil decay (NPD) values were averaged. Thus, an NPD that was not significantly different from 1.0 was interpreted as indicating that melanopsin activation had occurred.\n\nResults:\nOver successive pulses, the NPD decreased until it was not significantly different from 1.0 at pulse 5 (1.11, 95% CI [0.93, 1.28]) for RED and pulse 2 (1.03, [0.84, 1.23]) for ALT in session 1; and at pulse 6 (1.32, [0.92, 1.91]) for RED, pulse 4 (1.22, [0.99, 1.47]) for BLUE, and pulse 3 (1.23, [0.98, 1.47]) for the ALT in session 2.\n\nConclusion(s):\nRepeated exposure to bright and dim light causes a retardation of the pupil’s re-dilation kinetics. Whereas a single pulse of dim light may be insufficient to simulate ipRGCs, repeated exposure to the same light may potentiate these cells’ ability to respond to subthreshold stimuli.","title":"Effect of Repeated Light Exposure on Pupil Re-dilation Kinetics: Implications for Melanopsin Activation Threshold","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175172\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Hartwick\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352 \n                    \n            |#|"}

The reported study aimed to test if a brand-name computer glasses provide any advantages in the aforementioned benefits.\n\nMethods:\nA two-visit within-subject crossover design was used. Thirty-four routine computer users (18-41 yo, acuity 20/25+, normal color vision) were stratified into 4 age groups (18-23, 24-29, 30-35, 36-41 yo). Half subjects wore Gunnar Glasses (yellow tint, with +0.5D, wrap frame) for a week while the other half wore no spectacles before both groups return for lab test. Then the subject switched glasses condition for another week before the second visit. During each 4-hour lab visit, subjects performed a series of tasks under three viewing conditions (control, bright glare, strong ventilation). Accuracy and speed were recorded for acuity test, contrast sensitivity, color identification, number search, target identification and spelling check while subject’s eye muscle contraction intensity were measured with surface electromyography. Realtime viewing distance was recorded. Post-task measurements included subjective rating of viewing discomfort, dry eye (tear break-up time and TearLab osmolarity), and accommodation (with accommodative amplitude). Order of the testing conditions were balanced between among subjects.\n\nResults:\nWhile subjective rating of discomfort was lower with glasses for older subjects, no nebefit was found in most objective measurements. Significant benefits of computer glasses were only observed from the oldest group for threshold acuity and TBUT under glare condition. Marginal significant effect was observed for number-search and spelling-check speed.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOverall, no clear evidence supports the claim of computer glasses in enhancing visual performance, though older subejcts tend to feel better effect in symptom relief. Effect on acuity and spelling check speed may come from the enlargement of the plus lens.","title":"Effect of Computer Glasses on Viewing Comfort and Performance in Office Work","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170060\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        James Sheedy\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352 \n                    \n            |#|"}

Palucorcel was successfully delivered to the subretinal space without a retinal break. Following surgery, imaging could detect the implanted cells through OCT and CFP if cells were deposited in imaging range. Microperimetry with a wide grid could be performed by these patients and, in some cases, captured the area of cell deposit showing retinal sensitivity change.\n\nConclusion(s):\nPalucorcel was safely delivered to the subretinal space of patients with dry AMD, and could be observed using different imaging modalities. MP detected change in retinal sensitivity in some eyes. Multi-modal imaging techniques may need to be modified to best visualize and characterize areas of cell delivery, as well as the macula and GA lesion area.","title":"Multi-modal Imaging of a Novel Subretinal Cell Therapy in Dry Age Related Macular Degeneration","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170039\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Johnson & Johnson Vision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Elenora Lad, Terri Malone, Michael Keane, James Baldassarre\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Duke University, Janssen, Janssen, Janssen\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E353\n                    \n            |#|"}

This population was identified as high risk for progression to proliferative disease in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) (ETDRS Report 12, Ophthalmology, 1991).\n\nMethods:\nIn the randomized phase 3 RIDE (NCT00473382)/RISE (NCT00473330) studies, pts with diabetic macular edema (N = 759) received monthly ranibizumab (RBZ) (0.3 mg or 0.5 mg) or sham treatment through the month (M) 24 primary end point. M24 DR outcomes and BL characteristics potentially associated with ≥ 2-step DR severity improvements are retrospectively evaluated herein.\n\nResults:\nAt BL, ~ 30% of pts in each arm had DR severity level 47/53 (35.9%, 30.0%, and 33.9% for RBZ 0.3 mg, RBZ 0.5 mg, and sham, respectively). In these pts with high-risk NPDR, 78.4% and 81.1% of RBZ 0.3 mg- and 0.5 mg-treated pts achieved ≥ 2-step DR improvement at M24 compared with only 11.6% of sham-treated pts (P < .0001). Notably, these rates of ≥ 2-step DR improvement with RBZ were more than 2 times higher than the overall population at M24 (37.2% and 35.9% for RBZ 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg, respectively) (Ip, Arch Ophthalmol, 2012). In pts with BL DR severity level 47/53, none of the BL characteristics examined were associated with ≥ 2-step DR improvement at M24 (P > .05). In the moderately severe to severe NPDR population, the rate of new proliferative events through M24 was 3 times lower with RBZ vs sham (9.1%, 9.5%, and 29.1% for RBZ 0.3 mg, RBZ 0.5 mg, and sham, respectively).\n\nConclusion(s):\nAt M24, > 75% of pts with moderately severe to severe NPDR at BL treated with RBZ experienced ≥ 2-step DR improvement from BL. RBZ treatment also reduced the proportion of these pts who experienced an on-study new proliferative event compared with sham through M24. BL characteristics examined in this population were not predictive of DR improvement.","title":"Ranibizumab Induced Significant Regression of Moderately Severe to Severe Nonproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy in Over 75% of Patients in RIDE/RISE","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170038\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Charles Retina Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lauren Hill, Lisa Tuomi, Avanti Ghanekar\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Genentech Inc., Genentech Inc., Genentech Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E353\n                    \n            |#|"}

Of those 70% were participated in traditional Medicare Part B. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness among older adults. Beginning in 2010 the Medicare program began making the billing data of individual providers available for public utilization. The purpose of this project was to explore aggregated data for optometry and ophthalmology providers in five key glaucoma codes.\n\nMethods:\nThe 2014 Provider Utilization and Payment dataset was downloaded from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A SAS(Cary, NC) dataset was created of all Medicare Part B claims for optometrists and ophthalmologists for five standard of care glaucoma tests: 76514(pachymetry), 92020(gonioscopy), 92083(threshold visual field), 92250(fundus photography), and 92133(optic nerve OCT). Data were aggregated by provider type(optometrist or ophthalmologist) and descriptive analyses of code utilization were developed.\n\nResults:\nIn 2014 26,777 optometrists and 17,328 ophthalmologists submitted Medicare Part B claims. The highest glaucoma utilization code was fundus photography with 2,865,260 services billed. This was followed in order of utilization by threshold visual fields (2,775,282), optic nerve OCT(2,316,338), gonioscopy(834,101) and pachymetry (392,642). Optometrist’s code utilization as a percentage of total services billed was highest for fundus photography at 38% and lowest for gonioscopy(15%) and pachymetry(16.6%). Fundus photography was the only service in which more optometrists than ophthalmologists submitted claims (12318 versus 8539). As a percentage of all optometrists submitting Medicare Part B claims, optometrists lowest test utilization rate was pachymetry(8%)and gonioscopy(9%).\n\nConclusion(s):\nOphthalmologists submit substantially more claims for services that are likely to be related to glaucoma. There is room for growth in optometry’s provision of these services.","title":"Glaucoma Testing Under the 2014 Medicare Part B Program","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170069\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Eighteen of the monkeys were also given 100 mg/kg of 7-MX by mouth (7-MX -3D/pl; n=10) or one drop of a 1.4% caffeine citrate solution instilled into both eyes BID (CT -3D/pl; n=8) until the end of lens wear (141±7 days old). The eye’s refractive status, corneal power and axial dimensions were assessed every two weeks. Data on normal refractive development were obtained from 37 untreated monkeys.\n\nResults:\nAt the end of the treatment period, the control animals reared with monocular -3D lenses exhibited significant compensating myopic anisometropias (-2.11±1.07D). In contrast the 7-MX -3D/pl and CT -3D/pl monkeys exhibited significant hyperopic ametropias in both eyes (median: 7-MX treated eye, +5.47D, p=0.002; 7-MX fellow eye, +4.28D, p=0.01; CT treated eye, +5.06 D, p=0.0005; CT fellow eye, +3.59D, p=0.007) compared to the -3D lens-reared controls, but were on average isometropic (7-MX -3D/pl, +0.34±1.96D; CT -3D/pl, +0.60±1.82D). The relative hyperopic changes in the 7-MX and CT monkeys were associated with shorter than normal vitreous chamber depths and correlated with increases in choroidal thickness. There were no side-effects noted in either the 7-MX or CT animals.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe results demonstrate that, in primates, daily systemic administration of 7-MX and the topical installation of caffeine slowed axial elongation rates, increased choroidal thickness, promoted the development of hyperopia in control eyes, and blocked the compensating myopia normally produced by hyperopic defocus. Overall, these findings suggest that adenosine receptor antagonists may be a safe and effective treatment strategy for slowing myopia progression.","title":"The Effects of Oral and Topically Applied Non-Selective Adenosine Antagonists on Emmetropization in Rhesus Monkeys","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170076\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Li-Fang Hung, Monica Jong, Lisa Ostrin, Earl Smith\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, Brien Holden Vision Institute, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

The “Poll Everywhere” application allows students to text responses to questions posed by faculty during lectures using computers or smart phones. The aim of this study is to determine if using the “Poll Everywhere” method can 1) enhance student engagement by providing them with prompt feedback about their newly-acquired knowledge from a lecture and 2) improve outcomes as measured by academic performance on the final exam.\n\nMethods:\nThe 2nd-year class of optometry students (N=141) was randomized into 2 groups; a control group and an intervention group. At the end of their lab sessions a 5 question quiz was given on the material presented in their lab lecture. The control group was given the quiz in written paper-pencil format. Quizzes were graded and returned during the following week’s lab session. The intervention group used the “Poll Everywhere” application for instantaneous feedback on their in-lab quizzes. Both groups of students 1) took the same final examination and 2) participated in a survey questionnaire to gather student feedback.\n\nResults:\nOn the final exam, compared to the performance of the control group (4.40 ± 0.76), the performance of the Poll Everywhere group (4.55 ± 0.65) while slightly higher was not statistically significant (p >.05, p =0.08). Survey results showed that students subjectively preferred the use of the Poll Everywhere application over the traditional paper-pencil quiz method.\n\nConclusion(s):\nAlthough the Poll Everywhere application was subjectively preferred by students during the laboratory session quizzes there was no significant effect on final student performance. Consideration should however be given to the intangible benefits of student engagement in a large classroom setting.","title":"Can Prompt Feedback Provided to Students Using The “Poll Everywhere” Application Improve the Effectiveness of Optometric Education?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170055\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University, Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jingyun Wang, Gale Orlansky, Lynn Trieu, Linda Casser\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University, Salus University, Salus University, Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Here, we begin to assess relationships between ocular and systemic diurnal rhythms in adults.\n\nMethods:\nAdult subjects (n=10, 23-41 yrs) wore a light, sleep and activity monitor for one week, after which a series of measurements were recorded every 4 hours (h) for 24 h. Subjects were in the dark from 23:00 to 7:00, and otherwise went about their daily activities. At each time point, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured, and 1 ml of saliva was collected for later melatonin and cortisol analysis. Ocular biometry was then measured (LenStar) and optical coherence tomography (Spectralis) images were collected. The scan protocol included six 30° radial scans centered at the fovea. Custom software was used to determine choroidal thickness. From blood pressure and IOP, mean ocular perfusion pressure (MOPP) was calculated. For each measure, a cosine function was fitted to the data and acrophase was determined.\n\nResults:\nOver the course of 24 h, all functions exhibited diurnal changes. Choroidal thickness peaked at 4 h, with a diurnal variation from -11±3.5 (mean±SE) to +16±4.9 µm, in approximate anti-phase with axial length which peaked at 20 h, with a diurnal variation from -14±6.5 to +14±6.6 µm. Melatonin increased following light offset with a peak at 4 h, while cortisol peaked after light onset and decreased throughout the day. IOP peaked at 8 h, with a diurnal variation from -1.8±0.5 to +1.1±0.5 mmHg. MOPP peaked at light offset (24 h).\n\nConclusion(s):\nDiurnal variation in ocular and systemic processes were observed over 24 hours in young adults, with each function exhibiting a unique acrophase and relationship with light exposure. Further subject recruitment will provide information on relationships with refractive error.","title":"Ocular and Systemic Diurnal Rhythms in Adults","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170079\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nimesh Patel, Lisa Ostrin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study examined the relationships between clinical vision measures, including reading performance, among visually impaired patients. The main goal was to evaluate predictive models for reading based on parameters collected during eye examinations.\n\nMethods:\nIn this retrospective chart review, we evaluated examination data for 410 new patients who presented to the Low Vision Rehabilitation Service at The Ohio State University College of Optometry during a three-year period (2012 to 2015). A minimum set of reading data was the primary inclusion criterion. Measures of interest included best corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, lighting preferences, estimated peak reading speed, critical print size (i.e. smallest angular print size to allow maximum reading rate), and threshold print size.\n\nResults:\nThe average age of patients was 72 years (SD 19.1), and the majority of patients were female (65%) and had AMD (53%). The ratio of critical print size to distance best-corrected visual acuity averaged 1.94x (SD 0.29 log units), while the ratio of critical print size to threshold print size averaged 1.52x (SD 0.22 log units). These standard deviations reflect differences of about a factor of 2x and a factor of 1.64x, respectively.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur patient demographics are similar to those of other low vision clinic studies. Distance acuity and/or threshold reading acuity can be used as predictors of critical print size, but with significant variability in those predictions. These results suggest that critical print size should be measured, rather than inferred from a threshold acuity measurement.","title":"The Ohio Reading and Visual Impairment Study (ORVIS): A Retrospective Chart Review","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170104\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Roanne Flom, Thomas Raasch\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study uses mixed methods to explore eye care practitioners’ perspective on barriers to effective AMD care.\n\nMethods:\nSeven focus groups involving 67 optometrists were conducted by an experienced facilitator. A nominal group technique was used to identify, prioritize and semi-quantify barriers to AMD. Optometrists individually ranked their perceived top five barriers with the most important granted a score of 5 and the least important a score of 1. For each barrier, the number of votes it received and its total score were recorded. Barriers selected by at least one optometrist in their top 5 were then qualitatively analysed, grouped using thematic analysis and a combined weighted score calculated for each consolidated barrier. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with 10 ophthalmologists and 2 optometrists. Contributions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed with NVivo software.\n\nResults:\nMore than 130 barriers to AMD were identified in the focus groups. Of these, 78 were selected as one of their top 5 by at least one optometrist and further consolidated into 17 barriers after thematic analysis. Optometrists considered patients’ poor disease understanding / denial, cost of care / lack of funding, and poor care pathways as the most significant barriers to AMD care with weighted scores 21.6, 15.6, and 12.4 respectively. Factors impacting AMD identified through analysis of the transcripts were coded to patient-centered, practitioner-centered, and structural factors primarily.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur findings suggest that Australian eye care practitioners perceive that patient support systems and appropriately funded, clearer care pathway would benefit people with AMD.","title":"Eye Care Practitioners’ Perspectives on Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Mixed-Method Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170072\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UNSW Australia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Dian Rahardjo, Aryati Yashadhana, Bamini Gopinath, Gerald Liew\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UNSW Sydney, UNSW Sydney, University of Sydney, University of Sydney\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Evening light exposure and/or changes in sleep/wake behavior can cause dysregulation of melatonin, which is associated with impaired mood and cognitive performance. This study examined the effects of modifying short-wavelength blue light exposure on evening melatonin levels, sleep onset, mood and cognition.\n\nMethods:\nA randomized controlled trial with crossover-design evaluated BluTech Lenses (blue light filter intervention) versus clear lenses with anti-reflective coating only (control). These lenses were fitted into spectacle frames with black-out side-shields worn after 6:00pm for five days (Mon.-Fri.) by 24 undergraduate students. Actigraphy watches non-invasively recorded sleep patterns each night. On the fifth evening, saliva samples were collected to quantify melatonin levels, and self-reported mood and neurobehavioral performance were assessed with the NIH Toolbox Emotion and Cognition batteries, respectively.\n\nResults:\nA significant increase in melatonin levels was measured with the BluTech Lenses compared to control (9.6 vs. 4.9; p = 0.036). Sleep onset latency measured by actigraphy was slightly reduced with the Blutech Lenses, but not statistically significantly different between glasses. Pattern comparison was significantly improved after wearing the BluTech Lenses (p = 0.03), while other aspects of cognition were not significantly affected (p > 0.05). Perceived hostility was significantly reduced with the BluTech Lenses (p = 0.03); however, other measures of mood were not significantly different between glasses (p > 0.05).\n\nConclusion(s):\nBluTech Lenses appear to help regulate melatonin and can potentially be applied to at risk populations (e.g. shift-workers or students who spend nighttime hours studying with electronic devices) in order to lessen the deleterious effects of light exposure at night.","title":"Effects of BluTech Lenses on Melatonin, Sleep, Mood, and Neurobehavioral Performance","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170059\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ava Bittner, Morgan Garman, Reaghan May, Jaime Tartar\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

The lipidome reported to date, however, differs from human meibum. Trypsin, a common cell-collection reagent, may be responsible for membrane cleavage and neutral lipid loss from the cell. An in vitro experiment was conducted to evaluate neutral lipid recovery following two trypsin-free methods compared to the traditional technique.\n\nMethods:\nHMGECs were cultured in serum-containing media for two days to promote lipid production. A modified Folch method was used to extract lipids following three harvesting techniques. Cells were either harvested by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, harvested by 10 mM EDTA, or simultaneously harvested and extracted in glass culture dishes by direct application of 2:1 chloroform-methanol (c-m). After extraction, the nonpolar phase was withdrawn, processed, and directly infused into a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA) with electrospray ionization. MS and MS/MSall spectra were acquired in both positive and negative modes.\n\nResults:\nMS/MS spectra were similar across all groups. Phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and sphingomyelins were the most abundant species detected, while the nonpolar cholesteryl esters (CEs) and wax esters were of low abundance ( < 1%). Although the profiles between techniques were similar, there was a 4-fold increase in overall peak intensity for the c-m method compared to the others. Ultra-long chain (n\nc\n=24-34) CEs, lipid species characteristic of human meibum, were present in all samples.\n\nConclusion(s):\nNeutral lipid recovery was similar across all techniques; therefore, the ideal technique may depend on the desired application. For lipids of low abundance, the increased signal intensity provided by the c-m method may be preferred. This fast and easy technique also has the added advantage of fewer total steps and fewer reagents.","title":"Evaluation of Trypsin-Free Collection Techniques to Optimize Lipidomic Analysis of Immortalized Human Meibomian Gland Epithelial Cells in Culture","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170012\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jianzhong Chen, Kelly Nichols\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study was to examine visual function in athletes with and without a history of concussion.\n\nMethods:\nThis was a retrospective study of data collected from 319 varsity athletes (age 17 - 29) at the University of Waterloo from 2013 - 2016. Athletes played a variety of sports, and were healthy at the time of testing. Binocular visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), best eye blur (autorefraction), stereopsis, King Devick Concussion Test scores (KD) and visuomotor reaction time (VMRT) were measured. Athletes also reported concussion history and visual symptoms (in everyday activities, in sport). Differences between groups were compared using Student’s t-tests.\n\nResults:\n27% of athletes reported a history of at least one concussion. Visual symptoms in sport, VA (n = 311), best eye blur (n = 281), stereopsis (n = 115), KD (n = 242), and central (n = 160) and peripheral (n = 143) VMRT were not different between athletes with and without concussion (p > 0.05).  CS was (n=116) better in athletes with concussion (p < 0.01). There was no difference in reported visual symptoms with everyday activities (concussion: 42%, none: 34%, p = 0.20) or in sport (concussion: 25%, none: 23%, p = 0.22), but athletes with symptoms in sport ad significantly worse VA (p < 0.01) and significantly slower central VMRT (p < 0.01).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThere does not appear to be any long-term impact of presumably healed concussions on visual function. This study was limited because athletes did not report the number of previous concussions they had or the time since their last injury, and not every athlete completed every test. The suggestion that perhaps athletes with a history of concussion have more visual symptoms warrants further investigation.","title":"Does a History of Concussion Matter?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170018\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo School of Optometry & Vision Science\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Claudia Sikorski, Trefford Simpson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Vision & Motor Performance Lab University of Waterloo, School of Optometry & Vision Science University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the New England College of Optometry IRB.\n\nA series of 26 trial lenses with powers ranging from +10 to -10D were introduced in a double-blind, randomized order. For each lens, the subject rated the magnitude of perceived monocular blur on a scale of 0 to 6. Visual acuity (ETDRS), contrast sensitivity (Mars) and the central 10° of the visual field (Berkeley Central Visual Field Test) were measured for each eye. The magnitude of perceived blur was plotted against lens power.  Best-fit lines characterize subject perceived blur with increasing plus or minus lens powers.\n\nResults:\nThe low vision subjects showed more diversity. Most eyes (20 of 24) showed a steeper slope for the plus lenses, i.e., blur increased more rapidly with plus lens power.  The average ratio of the plus and minus lens slopes was about 1.25:1.  The r-squared values for the fitted slopes averaged 0.85 for the normally sighted and 0.63 for the low vision eyes.\n\nConclusion(s):\nPerceived blur was less for defocus from minus lenses compared with plus lenses. Patients with low vision show greater inconsistency in the relationship between lens power and perceived blur.  These findings have clinical implications for the bracketing and “JND” methods commonly recommended for refracting eyes with low vision.","title":"Blur Discrimination in Low Vision","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170102\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nicole Ross, Ian Bailey\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New England College of Optometry, University of California Berkeley College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

In the first channel of our system the 2 Airy disk diameter (ADD) confocal pinhole has a reflective surround that re-images the region outside of PSF center onto a micro-mirror array  (TI-DLP 6500). By sending a digital image to the DLP, each micro-mirror can be tilted to the ON (+12°) or OFF state (-12°) depending on the pattern. Each state is sent to a detector. For this study we used split annuli (SA) apertures with a constant outer radius (OR) of ~23 ADD and varied the inner radius (IR) (~2.3-11 ADD, ~1.5 ADD increments) with fixed orientation or used a fixed IR (~8 ADD) and rotated the aperture in 45° increments. We also used a through focus series with a constant IR and OR in 2 subjects. Images were processed with custom MATLAB software.\n\nResults:\nIn all subjects, a cellular array was visualized when focused at the level of the RGCs. This was confirmed with the through focus series.  The cell contrast varied with IR displacement. Orientation of the SA changed the visualization of the RGCs and the ability to observe them co-localized with nerve fiber bundles. Combining images across orientations enhances RGC soma contrast.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn vivo imaging of RGC somas is possible in AOSLO systems with multiply scattered light imaging. The digital micro mirror array enabled rapid collection of multiple aperture conditions within one imaging session. Optimization of aperture conditions for RGC imaging in AOSLO systems will need to account for topography variations based on retinal eccentricity and limited axial resolution.","title":"Multiply Scattered Light Imaging of RGC Somas Using a Computer Controlled Programmable Aperture (AOSLO)","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170036\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ting Luo, Raymond Warner, Stephen Burns\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study was to compare the corneal nerve morphology from the central and inferior whorl and to evaluate their capability to differentiate patients with differing severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).\n\nMethods:\nA cohort of 121 participants with type 1 diabetes and 52 age-balanced non-diabetic controls underwent corneal confocal microscopy at the central cornea and inferior whorl regions on the eye of the dominant-hand side. Corneal nerve fiber length was obtained at the central cornea (CNFLcenter) and inferior whorl (CNFLwhorl) using a fully-automated technique. The neuropathy disability score (NDS) was used to identify and stratify the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) [without DPN (NDS < 3, n = 99), with mild DPN (3 ≤ NDS ≤ 5, n = 16) and moderate-severe DPN (6 ≤ NDS ≤ 10, n = 6)].\n\nResults:\nCNFLcenter and CNFLwhorl differentiated participants with DPN from those without DPN (DPN-ve) and controls (P < 0.05). CNFLcenter and CNFLwhorl correlated with the severity of neuropathy (Spearman's rho, -0.35 and -0.24, respectively, P < 0.01). In terms of severity stratification, while CNFLcenter differentiated the DPN-ve group from the mild (P=0.04) and moderate-severe (P = 0.02) DPN groups, CNFLwhorl only differentiated DPN-ve group vs. moderate-severe DPN group (P = 0.02). Both CNFLcenter and CNFLwhorl did not differ between the mild and the moderate-severe (P = 0.4 and P = 0.2, respectively) DPN groups.\n\nConclusion(s):\nQuantification of nerve pathology at the central cornea as opposed to the inferior whorl region is not only easier, but also performs better in identifying patients with mild DPN and shows a better relationship with DPN severity.","title":"Fully-Automated Quantification of Central Corneal Nerve Morphology Outperforms Inferior Whorl in Stratification of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170013\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        CSIRO\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nicola Pritchard, Katie Edwards, Sangeetha Srinivasan, Anthony Russell, Rayaz Malik, Nathan Efron\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Institute of Health & Biomedical Innovation QUT, Institute of Health & Biomedical Innovation QUT, Institute of Health & Biomedical Innovation QUT, University of Queensland, University of Manchester and Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Institute of Health & Biomedical Innovation QUT\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, the direct functional impact of the oncoming HLG on cataracts during the driving was hardly measured. We used our dynamic HLG simulator to measure the effect of oncoming HLG on pedestrian detection in a driving simulator.\n\nMethods:\nFive patients (64 to 75 years old) with symptomatic cataracts participated. Visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) were measured in a stationary (no driving) condition, simulating a car is parked in opposite lane (at 60m away), with the HLG simulator turned on and off (HLGY/HLGN). Then all subjects drove three scenarios under HLGY and HLGN. Each scenario contains 24-pedestrian encounters with an oncoming car during about 12 min drive. Four pedestrian types were included: pedestrians appear at the left/right sidewalk, and then walk along/cross the road. Reaction time for the pedestrian detection was measured. A pairwise t-test was applied to the VAs and CSs under HLGY and HLGN. A two-way ANOVA was applied to the reaction times.\n\nResults:\nNo significant changes were found in both VA and CS with HLGN and HLGY: 0.06 ± 0.05 vs. 0.04 ± 0.07 LogMAR, and 0.71 ± 0.07 vs. 0.64 ± 0.07 LogCS, respectively. Significant main effect of HLG (F(1, 39) = 40.74, p < 0.01) was found, where the response time under HLGY (3.54 ± 0.67sec) was substantially higher than under HLGN (1.81 ± 0.71sec). No significant main effect of pedestrian types or interaction was found. The total misses (no response to the pedestrian) were 8% under HLGY and 1% under HLGN.\n\nConclusion(s):\nPatients with cataracts showed substantial performance degradation under HLGY, which may prevent timely responses to the pedestrians at night. Conventional vision measures (VA & CS) under stationary glare source showed limited predicting power for estimating the actual impact of HLG during nighttime driving.","title":"Measuring the Effect of Oncoming Headlight Glare for Cataracts Patients Using a Driving Simulator with Dynamic Headlight Glare Simulator","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170103\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Merve Tuccar, Eli Peli\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute, Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Daniel Taylor","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/understanding-the-cranial-nerves-evaluating-the-efficacy-of-a-self-paced-online-learning-module","text":"Abstract\n\nPurpose:\nBased upon a felt need that optometry students were struggling to adequately master the cranial nerves, a self-paced, online module entitled Understanding the Cranial Nerves was developed, tested, and eventually implemented in the Neuroanatomy course at Southern College of Optometry in 2015. This report will explore the statistical underpinnings of the original felt need, and test whether student mastery improved upon module implementation.\n\nMethods:\nCranial nerve mastery was measured by semester examination scores from the Neuroanatomy course. Final examinations were excluded due to fundamental differences in both their content and student preparation. To test the original felt need, results were used from semester examination from 2010 to 2014. The percent of examination items relating to cranial nerves was compared to mean class score on each examination using Pearson’s product-moment correlation. To determine the effect of the module, this same method was followed for semester examinations from 2015 to 2016. Finally, correlation coefficients from both samples were compared via Fischer r-to-z transformation.\n\nResults:\nFor examinations prior to implementation: rpre(8) = -0.850 (p < 0.01); implying an inverse relationship between the percentage of cranial nerve examination items and mean class score. For examinations after implementation: rpost(2) = -0.429 (p > 0.05), implying a weaker, though non-significant effect. Fischer r-to­-z transformation returned a non-significant result as well (z = -0.75; p > 0.05).\n\nConclusion(s):\nOptometry students have historically had difficulty mastering the complexities of the cranial nerves. The Understanding the Cranial Nerves online module may address this difficulty, though the small number of data points available after its implementation preclude understanding of the effect’s significance. More data is needed to truly understand the module’s efficacy.","title":"Understanding the Cranial Nerves: Evaluating the Efficacy of a Self-Paced Online Learning Module","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170050\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Michigan College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study was to compare ScCL fitters’ interpretation of CCC in ScCLs.\n\nMethods:\nScCL fitters completed a web-based questionnaire (Qualtrics) regarding the assessment of factors associated with CCC. Participants were asked to provide a fill in the blank value (μm) for an average ideal initial CCC for a newly dispensed ScCL and for a finalized ScCL. Participants then were provided with five cross sectional images of ScCL with varying depths of CCC (50, 150, 300, 500, and 600 μm) and selected the images that best described their ideal initial and finalized ScCL fit.\n\nResults:\n172 ScCL fitters provided consent and 165 completed the questionnaire. The average ± standard deviation of number of years for fitting ScCL and number of new ScCL fits/month were 5.5 ± 5.0 years and 7.4 ± 7.1 fits/month, respectively. For a newly dispensed lens and finalized lens, ScCL fitters reported an ideal CCC of 277.1 ± 56.4 and 194.8 ± 51.5 μm, respectively. When asked to identify the image that represented the ideal initial and finalized CCC, 0.6% and 5.5% chose 50 μm, 11.5% and 64.9% chose 150 μm, 77.6% and 24.9% chose 300 μm, 9.7% and 3.6% chose 500 μm, and 0.6% and 1.2 % chose 600 μm, respectively. Number of ScCL fitting years was not associated with initial (r = -0.07; p = 0.37) or finalized (r = -0.13; p = 0.10) CCC.\n\nConclusion(s):\nPractitioners report that an ideal finalized ScCL fit should have ~200 μm of CCC. This value is less than the ideal initial clearance likely due to ScCL settling. While our data are indicative of current clinical practice, additional work is needed to determine if ~200 μm of CCC results in ideal ocular health and patient satisfaction.","title":"Practitioner Assessment of Scleral Contact Lens Central Corneal Clearance","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170030\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lisa Jones-Jordan, Jamie Kuhn, Carolina Kunnen, Justin Kwan, Jessica Mathew, Andrew Pucker\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, Marshall B.

Obstacles for optometry students include: limited opportunities for practice and guided practice time with instructors. Simulators can safely fill these voids and provide feedback to reinforce technical skills. This study is to determine whether the Eyesi BIO Simulator can effectively teach BIO to 1st year optometry students with no prior exposure.\n\nMethods:\n99 first year students completed Tiers A and B on the EyeSi BIO Simulator in the Spring Quarter through 10 weeks of self-study. Students were provided online orientation to the equipment and a video demonstrating basic technique and common mistakes with no additional faculty instruction. During the first laboratory meeting in the subsequent quarter, students were given a Pre-lab Mini-Proficiency (PLMP). The students then received faculty instruction, practiced for 3 weeks, and subsequently evaluated with the Posterior Pole Mini-Proficiency (PPMP) as customary to previous years. Scores from the PLMP and PPMP were compared as well as the PPMP scores from the previous year.\n\nResults:\nThe mean score of the PLMP was 2.46±2.08 and PPMP was 8.55±1.94 (p < 0.001) out of a possible 10 points. The mean PPMP score for the previous year was 8.83 (p = 0.31). On the PLMP 5% of the class met competency versus 82.82% on the PPMP.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe results showed that simulators alone cannot teach BIO to a competent level. Additionally, there was no improvement in mean score following simulator and faculty instruction. The results of this study have aided instruction design for educational effectiveness.","title":"Can Simulators Teach BIO?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170053\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Marshall B.

Many complications of head injury are evident immediately or soon after injury. These signs and symptoms are used to diagnose traumatic brain injury (TBI) and as guidelines for limiting sports participation and determining return to play. Relationships between TBI and delayed or lasting sequelae are less understood because of the variable latency period before overt neurologic dysfunction. Several studies have shown a persistent decrease in ocular and visual motor function after even a mild TBI up to 1 year post injury. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the ocular motor function for any deterioration in athletes who had a reported history of head trauma over 3 months prior to a sports vision screening.\n\nMethods:\nOne hundred twelve male and female Division I college athletes, ages 18-21 years old, participated in a comprehensive sports vision screening based on the Illinois College of Optometry Sports Vision protocols. Sports represented were basketball, softball, tennis, soccer, cross country, track and field, volleyball, and golf. Included in this screening were multiple tests evaluating ocular motor function: the Wayne Saccadic Fixator test, Sanet Vision Integrator, and King Devick test. Thirty two of the participants reported a history of a sports related head trauma with a diagnosed concussion. The results of each of these individual tests were compared between those who had reported a history of concussion and those who had not.\n\nResults:\nThere was no significant difference between those with a self- reported history of concussion compared to those without on the Wayne Saccadic Fixtator, Sanet Vision Integrator, or King Devick Test.\n\nConclusion(s):\nWhile longitudinal investigations are still needed, this study failed to identify any observable effect of sports concussion history on visual motor performance over 3 months post injury.","title":"Investigation of Lasting Ocular Motor Dysfunction in Sports Related Concussion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170019\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Navjit Sanghera, Stephen Beckerman\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

The stimulus consisted of a 3 degree circular patch and sinusoidal gratings (0.5–32 cpd) or luminance flicker (0.5-30Hz), both combined with a circular Gaussian envelope (sigma=0.5 and AR=1). The mean luminance was 87 cd/m2 and stimulus duration was 500ms for sCSF and 5sec for tCSF. For sCSF the subjects responded whether the grating was oriented at 90 or180 degree and for tCSF they responded whether they detected flicker. The data was fitted with the equation y=(a+bx)*(e-cx). The CSF parameters of Smax: peak contrast sensitivity, Fmax: spatial or temporal frequency of peak sensitivity, and Fc: high-spatial or -temporal frequency cutoff were derived from the fits and compared between TBI patients and age matched controls.\n\nResults:\nSignificant reduction with age was observed for all sCSF parameter [Smax: m=-0.012, p=0.001, Fmax: m=-0.032, p=0.018 and Fc: m=-0.314, p=0.006]. None of the tCSF parameters were significantly altered by age. CSF parameters of TBI patients were compared to a subset of control subjects in the same age range. Smax was the only sCSF parameter that was significantly different (p=0.04) between TBI patients (0.69+0.29) and age-matched control subjects (0.96+0.24). Snellen visual acuity of the two groups were not significantly different, a finding consistent with no significant difference in the Fc of sCSF between the two groups. None of the tCSF parameters were significantly different between the two groups.\n\nConclusion(s):\nsCSF but not tCSF is likely to be reduced in TBI patients when Snellen visual acuity is normal. sCSF testing at the peak spatial frequency is likely to be most sensitive in detecting sCSF deficits in TBI patients. This finding may assist in the evaluation of vision in TBI.","title":"Spatial and Temporal Contrast Sensitivity Function of Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170020\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Roa Al-Abdalla, Nabin Joshi, Kenneth Ciuffreda, Suresh Viswanathan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York College of Optometry, State University of New York College of Optometry, State University of New York College of Optometry, State University of New York College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects wore either DFCL or a single vision contact lens (SVCL) both omafilcon A (CooperVision). Participants’ initial myopia ranged from 0.75 to 4.00D and astigmatism was < 1.00D.\nCycloplegic autorefraction (SERE) and axial length (AL) were measured at baseline and every 12 months for 3 years. A linear mixed model (LMM), including fixed factors such as lens type, site, sex, visit and their interactions, was used to compare the adjusted change in SERE and AL. The model also included covariates such as age, baseline refraction and wearing times.\n\nResults:\n144 subjects were dispensed study lenses, 74 (control group) and 70 (test group) . There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in demographic factors influencing myopia progression between groups. After 3 years 108 subjects (56 SVCL; 52 DFCL) completed the study.

Exposure of rat retinas to dim (sub-melanopsin threshold) light that flickered at 6 Hz, a stimulus known to elevate retinal acetylcholine levels, was shown to evoke ipRGC excitation through this pathway. We hypothesize that this cholinergic pathway exists in humans, and as ipRGCs play a key role in pupil size regulation, we assessed whether increased pupil constriction occurs during prolonged exposure to 6 Hz flickering stimuli\n.\n\nMethods:\nSubjects (n=6; ages 23-43; 67% female) completed two sessions, one with blue (480 nm) and one with red (620 nm) light. Light irradiances were 10\n12\nphotons/s/cm\n2\n, which is below reported melanopsin thresholds. In every session there were 3 trials, each 5 min long and preceded by 15 min dark adaptation, using stimuli of different temporal frequencies (0, 6 and 30 Hz). Pupil size, normalized to each subject’s maximum (100%) and minimum (0%) constriction, was recorded throughout the trial.\n\nResults:\nMean normalized pupil size during the 5 min trials was 61.3% ± 8.2 SEM, 71.6% ± 5.6 and 55.2% ± 6.7 for 0, 6 and 30 Hz blue stimuli and was 61.9% ± 9.7, 80.5% ± 5.4 and 59.4% ± 7.7 for 0, 6 and 30 Hz red stimuli, respectively. In both sessions, mean pupil size was significantly different between the three trials (blue: p=0.006; red: p=0.003; one-way RM ANOVA), with greater pupil constriction during the 6 Hz stimulus.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur finding that there was greater pupil constriction in response to the 6 Hz red and blue stimuli, relative to 0 and 30 Hz, is consistent with the hypothesis that the cholinergic ipRGC stimulation pathway exists in humans. This pathway could serve to extend the dynamic range of irradiances for ipRGC stimulation under more natural environmental conditions.","title":"Pupil Constriction During Prolonged Exposure to Flickering Stimuli: Evidence for Cholinergic ipRGC Stimulation","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170058\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Phillip Yuhas, Andrew Hartwick\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Elizabeth Wong","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/the-use-of-oct-in-differential-diagnosis-of-elevated-optic-discs","text":"Abstract\n\nPurpose:\nRecent papers discussed the role of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the differential diagnosis of optic nerve head (ONH) elevation and its usefulness in detecting pathological ONH swelling. Given its use in assisting diagnosis in a range of ocular conditions, OCT should be beneficial in the differential diagnosis of optic disc swelling. In this study, we evaluated its en face value to distinguish papilloedema, other ONH pathologies, and non-pathological causes of optic disc elevation. We also assessed if short-term educational intervention on OCT improved the participants’ diagnosis.\n\nMethods:\nA web-based survey was developed displaying ONH photography with or without OCT line scans of 40 patients with various types of ONH swelling. Optometrists from Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate through email by their respective professional organisations. Anonymous classifications for each case were initially recorded from ONH photography only for 197 practicing optometrists alongside basic descriptors of the participants. The respondents were subsequently randomised and repeated the assessment on ONH images with the addition of OCT line scans without (control group, n=91) of with (intervention group, n=106) a short education on OCT image interpretation. The number of correct answers for the classification papilloedema (n=5), other pathologies (n=17) and normal (n=18) were noted. Differences between groups were statistically analysed.\n\nResults:\nThe number of correct answers was normally distributed for all assessed groups. Participant characteristics, such as exposure to OCT scans, had no influence on results. Diagnostic accuracy showed a small but significant decrease from 66% ± 8.9 to 63% ± 10.6 in the control group with the use of OCT images. The intervention group showed a negligible improvement with availability of OCT line scans, accompanied by an overall 30% loss in correct diagnosis of papilloedema.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur results suggest that OCT should be reserved as an adjunct clinical diagnostic tool for practitioners with appropriate training in OCT interpretation. The provision of short-term education for new modes of assessment could pose a potential danger if used in lieu of evidence based clinical markers. OCT results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical examination of the optic disc, RNFL assessment, B-Scan ultrasound and fundus autofluorescence.","title":"The Use of OCT in Differential Diagnosis of Elevated Optic Discs","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170052\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jaclyn Chiang, Michael Hennessy, Michael Kalloniatis, Barbara Zangerl\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health, Prince of Wales Hospital, Centre for Eye Health, Centre for Eye Health\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

A 27-item Rasch validated questionnaire was administered in-person or over telephone which included questions on demographic characteristics and KAP towards visually disabled as employees.\n\nResults:\nEmployers had adequate knowledge (68%), positive attitude (70%) and practices (64%) towards employment of the visually disabled. Adequate KAP was independent of age (p= 0.37), gender (p=0.43), work experience (p=0.39), and type of organization (p=0.38) of the employers. Majority (82%) of the employers cited an appropriate source of information about visual disability and accommodations. Approximately two-thirds of the employers (64%) agreed or strongly agreed that they would support employment of persons with visual disabilities, but only 14% reported employing the visually disabled. Majority (96%) could not identify how the visually disabled persons perform any of the typical job tasks and considered them fit to be employed as teachers, storekeepers and telecallers. Common reasons for not employing the visually disabled included lack of receipt of job applications, unsuitability for the job, and the belief that visually disabled cannot use computers.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis is the first-of-its kind survey in India that has generated information about KAP among employers regarding employment of the visually disabled. Although knowledge regarding employment of people with visual disabilities is high amongst potential employers, the practice is still low. Effective public education initiatives such as job fairs aimed specifically at potential employers should provide practical and appropriate means to change their practice.","title":"Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of Employers Towards People with Visual Sisabilities: How Good or Bad Is It in India?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170101\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Meera & L B Deshpande Centre for Sight Enhancement\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Bharani Seelam\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        L V Prasad Eye Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Blue-yellow (BY) and red-green (RG) isoluminance is measured psychophysically using heterochromatic flicker photometry at 8 retinal eccentricities to compensate for macular pigment optical density changes across the retina. Isoluminant RG and BY, and achromatic (BW) ON-OFF and steady-state (SS) gratings is used to elicit the VEP responses. The SS VEP responses are analyzed using a fast Fourier transform to acquire amplitude and phase information.\n\nResults:\nNo significant differences are found between the mTBI and control group for amplitudes and latencies of the chromatic and achromatic ON-OFF VEPs. No significant differences are found in amplitude between the two groups for the BW and RG SS stimuli. BY SS mean amplitude is significantly decreased in the mTBI group compared to the control group (273 ± 121 nV vs 556 ± 175 nV, p=0.026). Mean FFT phase is significantly increased in the mTBI group for the BY (80.6 ± 14.3 ms vs 17.5 ± 8.7 ms, p < 0.001) and the RG SS stimuli (62 ms ± 8.7 vs 39.5 ± 11.9 ms, p = 0.01).

Whether a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may affect pupil dynamics and confound the interpretation of pupil data in other causes of visual dysfunction is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between history of mTBI and dynamic pupil parameters recorded with high definition pupillography.\n\nMethods:\nA total of 151 subjects aged from 19 to 81 years were enrolled from the annual meeting of American Academy of Optometry 2016. The following parameters were collected: ocular and systemic health histories, current medications, history of TBI, dynamic pupil measurements tested with a white light stimulus using the automated afferent pupillary defect protocol programmed in the RAPDx (Konan Medical). Multiple regressions with backward analysis were used to identify whether age, history of mTBI, resting pupil diameter predicted pupil dynamics.\n\nResults:\nThere were 46 subjects with previous history of mTBI and 105 subjects without history of mTBI. Among the subjects with positive mTBI history, 18 of them had more than one episode of mTBI. Resting pupil diameter was not statistically significant between subjects with mTBI and ones without mTBI. Multiple regression analysis showed that both history of mTBI and number of mTBIs significantly predicted between-eye differences in latency of constriction onset (p = 0 .0004).

Their role in illuminance detection and dopamine release suggests that intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) may play a role in this effect. Studies conducted on adults found that changes in ipRGC-driven pupil responses to multiple red and blue stimuli differed between myopic and non-myopic subjects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether this effect occurs in children.\n\nMethods:\nSubjects were 30 children aged 8-17 years (average age 11.2 ± 2.6 years, 19 females) with spherical equivalent between +1.04 and -3.48 diopters (non-cycloplegic autorefraction). The IOLMaster was used to measure axial length. The RAPDx pupilometer measured pupil responses to three different 0.1 Hz (light-dark) stimulus protocols: 1) alternating red and blue, 2) red-only, and 3) blue-only. The primary outcome measure was the average difference in pupil size between blue and red stimulation, comparing blue-only to alternating blue and red-only to alternating red.\n\nResults:\nPupil size tended to be smaller during blue-only stimulation compared with the alternating protocol in non-myopes. Alternatively, pupil size tended to be smaller during red-only stimulation compared with the alternating protocol in myopes. Adjusted for age, the difference in pupil size between blue and red stimulation was significantly correlated with refractive error (R\n2\n= 0.14, p = 0.032) and axial length (R\n2\n= 0.15, p = 0.026).\n\nConclusion(s):\nSubjects with more hyperopic, less myopic refractive error exhibited smaller pupils during blue stimulation and larger pupils during red stimulation. The smaller pupil size with blue is likely attributable to more robust ipRGC input to the pupil response. The differing pupil responses to red and blue stimuli are consistent with the hypothesis that greater ipRGC activity is protectively associated with less myopia and shorter axial length.","title":"The Effect of Refractive Error on Pupil Responses to Blue and Red Stimuli in Children","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170078\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Hartwick\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Respondents were recruited via poster, social media and snowball methods. Two of the researchers moderated seven, 60- to 90-minute, semi-structured focus group discussions, which were audiotaped and transcribed. Respondents also completed a demographic questionnaire. The researchers employed constant comparative coding strategies to identify common themes within the respondent transcripts.\n\nResults:\nThe focus groups included 25 respondents (9 male, 16 female), ranging in age from 18 to 71 years (mean 41.7; median 42). Two main themes, ‘value’ and ‘capacity’, included both motivators and deterrents for seeking eye care. ‘Value’ motivators included ‘knowledge’ about eye care (personal experience, family guidance, professional advice) and ‘prioritizing’ eye care (symptoms and habits).  In contrast, ‘knowledge’ and ‘prioritizing’ also served as care-seeking deterrents: ‘lack of knowledge’ (knowledge deficits, reliance on symptoms to prompt eye care) and ‘failure to prioritize’ (prioritizing others, lacking priority, test distress).  ‘Capacity’ was enhanced by insurance coverage and deterred by cost.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe strongest deterrents to seeking eye care among these respondents pertained to knowledge deficits, symptom reliance and test distress.  Identifying these deterrents is important to those who provide eye care and set public policy so that enhanced patient and public education strategies can be developed.","title":"Motivators and Deterrents for Seeking Eye Care","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170073\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Alisa Sivak, Elizabeth Irving\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Prior studies excluded the +SN population, which has problems with lateralized attention, divided attention, insight, and awareness; all may limit their ability to detect and interpret obstacles within the prism-expanded field of view.\n\nMethod:\nParticipants (24 with HH; 10 with +SN, 14 without -SN) viewed a realistic, animated, shopping-mall corridor and reported if they would have collided with a human obstacle which appeared at various offsets (up to 13.5°) from the simulated walking path (up to 88 trials per condition). Gaze was fixed at center of expansion of the flow field with and without p-prisms, in a counterbalanced order. Participants had no prior experience with p-prisms and no training in use. A mixed-effects logistic regression included covariates gender, age, duration of vision loss, SN test score (severity), and cognitive status.\n\nResults:\nWithout p-prisms, +SN had marginally worse blindside detection than -SN (p = 0.069; +SN detection 26% and -SN 43%). With p-prisms, blindside detection improved in both groups (+SN to 92%; -SN to 98%), which was not different between groups (p = 0.295). None of the covariates were significant for detection. For collision judgments, without p-prisms there were fewer perceived collisions on the blindside in both groups (-SN 22%/44% (blind/seeing); +SN 15%/38%), p < 0.001. With p-prisms, blindside perceived collisions were now higher than the seeing side in both groups, -SN 70%/30% and +SN 68%/36% (p < 0.001), and not different between the groups (p = 0.11).

Self-reported HL, VL or DSL and eight IADLs and walking were assessed in fifteen studies of the Dutch National Care for the Elderly Program (TOPICS-MDS). For each study, the risks and probabilities of limitations in IADLs and walking per five-year increase in age stratified by sensory loss (SL) were calculated using generalized mixed linear models. Models were fitted on an age-scale, corrected for confounders. Subsequently, individual study estimates were pooled.\n\nResults:\nAt baseline, the number of IADL-limitations was the highest in DSL (2.00 [IQR 1.00 – 4.00]) and VL (2.00 [IQR 1.00 – 3.00]) compared to no SL (NSL) or HL (1.00 [IQR 0.00 – 2.00]). Trajectories of the individual IADLs and walking showed an increase in limitations in all IADLs and walking with age. Difficulties with household tasks and traveling showed the most rapid and almost linear decline with age. Shopping and walking had an initial gentle decline with an exponential increase after age 80 years. Telephone use and meal preparation showed a gentle decline with > 80% being competent at age 100 years. No significant differences between groups with and without SL were found for any IADL or walking (p-values > 0.100).

We observed that persons with self-reported SL had higher levels of self-reported functional limitations at baseline.

This study was to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress intra-assay ELISA kit outcomes for hexanoyl-lysine (HEL) and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) are repeatable for human tears; additionally, to test a subset of tear samples using 8OHdG ELISA for possible storage effects.\n\nMethods:\nFifty volunteers participated in the study. Tears were collected from the inferior tear meniscus using glass microcapillary tubes. Standard dilution to 1:20 concentration was performed prior to conducting ELISA assays. Intra-assay repeatability was evaluated by comparison of differences in HEL and 8OHdG expression of individual samples as measured in 2 separate wells of a single ELISA plate. A subgroup of 10 tear samples was evaluated using 8OHdG ELISA, re-frozen and stored at -80C for one year, then re-evaluated using 8OHdG ELISA. Repeatability of ELISA kits following manufacturers’ protocols was estimated using Bland-Altman plots. Storage effects were compared for percent change between ELISA assays.\n\nResults:\nBland-Altman estimates of repeatability for tears were excellent, with following bias and 95% limits of agreement: HEL ELISA +0.02 (+0.44, -0.39); 8OHdG ELISA -0.04 (+0.06, -0.15). The subgroup of 10 samples evaluated twice, with the second ELISA conducted after re-freezing and one year of storage, were found to have a mean increase of 8OHdG expression by approximately 16 (±14.63) % compared with initial ELISA expression.\n\nConclusion(s):\nHEL and 8OHdG ELISA kits evaluated had excellent intra-assay repeatability using human tears. Nonetheless, tear storage protocols may influence 8OHdG ELISA outcomes. Hence, our findings suggest tears should be analyzed for 8OHdG expression at equal intervals following collection, with limited freeze-thaw cycles prior to analysis.","title":"Repeatability of Oxidative Stress ELISA Kits and Storage Effects for Human Tears","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170011\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Heather Chandler\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

The IEPS, a 7-point Likert Scale Survey, includes 18 questions evaluating intraprofessional or interprofessional perceptions. Students were divided into Group I (n=35) assigned clinical sites that utilize interprofessionally shared EHR, and Group II (n=35) assigned sites that do not utilize interprofessionally shared EHR. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test compared changes in total score from A and B between groups. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test compared survey A and B scores for each question.\n\nResults:\nSeventy subjects completed surveys for A and B. No difference in total A-B scores were found between Groups I and II (p=0.101). Five questions had significant changes in responses, with one for Group I (Q5: p=0.001), and four for Group II (Q1: p=0.017, Q4: p=0.026, Q6: p=0.011, and Q14: p=0.016). Q1 and Q5 evaluated intraprofessional perceptions, with Q1 changing positively and Q5 changing negatively. Q6 and Q14 evaluated student perception of other professions and Q4 evaluated student perception that other professions have of optometry, all showing a positive change.\n\nConclusion(s):\nNo differences were found in student perception for those exposed to shared EHR versus those without a shared EHR. However, clinical experiences appear to have an impact on perceptions for some. Optometric educators should be aware of the clinical impact on perceptions when assessing interprofessional educational programs, especially if students are concurrently assigned to a clinical experience.","title":"Impact of Electronic Health Records and Clinical Experience on Interprofessional Student Perceptions","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170054\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Erik Weissberg, Beth Harper\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New England College of Optometry, New England College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Such deterioration, if left uncorrected, affects reading speed by requiring individuals to make more frequent regressions, which are backward eye movements to re-read words (Bullimore & Bailey, 1995; Legge et al., 1997). Although making regressions leads to slower reading speed, regressions are well-known to support text comprehension (Mousty & Bertelson, 1992; Schotter, Tran, & Rayner, 2014). Some braille teachers, however, interpret braille regressions as a shortcoming of the reader. Whether braille regressions occur as a result of degraded tactile input, rather than the reading ability of the individual, is unknown.\n\nMethods:\nTo investigate this gap in the literature, twelve blind adult participants’ finger movements were recorded while they read braille versions of the International Reading Speed Texts (IReST). To manipulate the clarity of tactile input, texts were presented in high, medium, and low braille dot heights. Participants were asked to read using one or two hands.\n\nResults:\nThe results revealed that average reading rate was significantly affected by braille height (F(2,60) = 46.41, p < 0.001), where the lowest braille height led to the slowest reading rate during both one- and two-handed conditions. Furthermore, the number of regressions were also significantly affected by braille height during one-handed (χ2(2) = 23.75, p < 0.001) and two-handed (χ2(2) = 24.79, p < 0.001) reading trials; specifically, more frequent regressions were found with the low braille height compared to medium and high braille heights during both hand conditions.\n\nConclusion(s):\nAltogether, these findings support the idea that regressions in visual and braille reading are not a shortcoming of the reader, but rather are made in an attempt to comprehend text conveyed by degraded input quality.","title":"Exploring the Similarities Between Regressions in Visual and Braille Reading","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170099\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Daisy Lei, Manfred MacKeben, Valerie Morash\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

The present study examined whether visually-evoked potentials (VEPs), visual discomfort and visual discrimination are modulated by the luminance and color of specific chromatic flickers.\n\nMethod:\nTwenty-nine adults with normal binocular distant acuity (20/25 or better), contrast sensitivity (< 16%) and color vision viewed flickers (8 cpd) composed of white/gray, green/red and blue/yellow gratings and matching luminance masks from 30 to 1500 cd/m\n2\n(e.g., red mask vs. red/green grating). Amplitude of VEP signals linked to luminance masks and grating targets (70 to 120 ms latency) were recorded and accuracy in grating discrimination measured. Visual discomfort was assessed after each block of trials with the same chromatic mask and luminance.\n\nResults:\nRepeated measures ANOVA revealed effect of color, F(4,20)=3.681, p = .021, and luminance, F(3,21)=10.612, p < .0001, on peak VEP amplitude. GLM analysis showed effect of color, X\n2\n= 12.847, p = .012, and luminance, X\n2\n= 24.334, p < .0001, on visual discomfort. Visual discrimination was impeded to a greater degree with higher luminance for white but not chromatic masks. Red and green masks led to higher mask-induced VEP amplitude and discomfort than blue masks when the mask luminance was higher.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe high excitability of the red/green opponency pathway is important for processing visual details, but likely causes greater flicker-induced visual discomfort with higher chromatic luminance, due to reduced mutual inhibition along associated chromatic pathways. These findings suggest the contrasting needs of selecting chromatic filters that reduce visual discomfort with low light transmittance while maintaining visual performance afforded by the color opponency systems.","title":"Chromatic Flickers Elevate Visual Cortical Activities and Discomfort Without Impeding Visual Discrimination","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170057\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ju Liu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Impression cytology was performed on the temporal bulbar conjunctiva and palpebral conjunctiva after upper eyelid eversion by applying a 7.5 mm semicircle of filter paper (0.45µm pore size). Right and left eye samples from each subject were stored together by sampling location. Gene expression was measured using the Taqman Cells to CT Kit and evaluated by real-time PCR using Taqman probes. Expression levels were normalized using housekeeping gene GAPDH. Statistical analyses included non-parametric testing and Spearman rank.\n\nResults:\nMUC16 expression was detected in the palpebral conjunctiva of the upper eyelid in both normal and dry eye subjects. Expression of MUC16 in the palpebral conjunctiva was 1.18 ± 0.70 fold higher in normal subjects and 1.40 ± 0.94 fold higher in dry eye subjects relative to GAPDH.

An international, online registry was recently developed for individuals with inherited retinal disease, known as My Retina Tracker®. Questionnaire responses in this registry were used to explore whether x-linked (XL) RP, previously documented as the most severe form of RP, was associated with worse visual and functional outcomes when compared to autosomal dominant (AD) RP mutations, which have been shown to follow a milder course.\n\nMethods:\nWe used the My Retina Tracker® registry to obtain de-identified, cross-sectional, self-reported data from 1,332 people with RP. Of them, 202 people reported which RP-causing gene mutation had been identified and the inheritance type was confirmed by their family history; 46 men indicated a specific XL gene mutation, while 33 males had an AD gene implicated. Regression models determined significant differences in responses from XL versus AD RP males.\n\nResults:\nXL RP males reported their first onset of RP symptoms occurred 10.6 years earlier on average than those with AD mutations (95% CI: 5.8,15.4; p < 0.001). Men with XL RP were 94% significantly less likely to indicate they were driving currently (95% CI: 0.02,0.2; p < 0.001) and were 2.5 times more likely to indicate progressive loss of reading ability (95% CI: 0.96,6.6; p = 0.06) when compared to males with AD RP. Needing a lot of help from others because of their eyesight was significantly reported 3.3 times more often by XL RP men (95% CI: 1.2,9.5; p = 0.027). However, those with XL RP were not significantly more likely to indicate a lot of frustration (p = 0.62) or worry about their eyesight (p = 0.70).\n\nConclusion(s):\nDespite earlier effects on vision and greater loss of independence, those with XL RP indicated positive adjustment to their visual functional loss that was similar to AD RP patients.","title":"Comparison of the Impact of Vision Loss in Men with X-Linked versus Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170085\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ava Bittner\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

To our knowledge, no studies have objectively assessed this difficulty. Here, we test whether the recently-developed information acquisition (IA) metric can measure the impact of vision impairment. IA is an objective measure of the ability to follow the story, which is important for two of the main purposes of watching video: information and entertainment.\n\nMethods:\nParticipants with CVL (n=21) or normal vision (NV, n=63) watched 30-second directed video clips from movies and documentaries, then described the clip content in response to an open question. An objective score was derived using natural-language processing by comparing each new response to a control database of descriptions of the same clip. To test whether the impact of CVL on IA was simply due to reduced resolution, another groups of NV participants (n=15) watched the same clips with defocus blur that reduced visual acuity to 20/50, 20/125, 20/320, or 20/800. Mixed models corrected for covariates age, education, gender and cognitive status.\n\nResults:\nCompared to the NV group, IA was worse for the CVL group (p < 0.001). IA reduced with worsening visual acuity (p < 0.001) and that reduction with worsening VA was greater for the CVL group than the NV-defocus group (p = 0.01). IA reduced with increasing age and less education.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe IA method measured the difficulty following the story experienced by people with CVL. Defocus blur recreated the CVL experience to some extent, though less well when the resolution was worse, suggesting that another factor is also a cause of the difficulty. Since IA can measure the impact of vision impairment on the video-viewing task, it is likely to be useful for measurement of the effect of related vision rehabilitation.","title":"Measuring the Difficulty Experienced by People with Central Vision Loss when Watching Videos","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170089\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Francisco Costela, Sidika Kajtezovic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute and Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351 \n                    \n            |#|"}

Therefore, we have worked to develop indices using en face RNFL thickness averaging across zones to help identify glaucomatous damage and minimize flagging people free of disease.\n\nMethods:\nRNFL was imaged and auto-segmented using a Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering) for one eye of 30 healthy people ages 20-31, 25 healthy people ages 49-82, and 30 patients with glaucoma ages 49-87. Two-degree boxes were created around the line connecting the fovea and optic disc using data from the healthy group ages 49-82 in which the boxes had valid thickness measurements. These boxes were further refined for the patients with glaucoma finding 103 boxes around the fovea-disc line. The boxes were then organized into zones of superior-temporal (ST), inferior-temporal (IT), temporal (T), and nasal (N). Cells were averaged across ST, IT, T, and N zones for all healthy people and patients. The minimum thickness was found for each zone in the healthy groups. Patients with glaucoma were then compared to the healthy groups identifying zones below minimum thickness.\n\nResults:\n29 of 30 patients with glaucoma were identified using criteria of at least one zone below minimum thickness measurements. As the reference was set using the minimum thicknesses for healthy people, 0 out of 55 healthy people were identified. Coefficients of variance for the zones were 0.11 ST, 0.13 IT, 0.15 T, and 0.23 N. IT failed 26 eyes, ST failed 15 of the same eyes as IT and 3 additional while T flagged 8 and N failed 25 eyes.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIndices based on RNFL projections to IT and ST showed promise for identifying glaucomatous damage. Surprisingly, an index based on RNFL projection to N failed almost as many patients. Further research is needed to understand this finding and optimize indices.","title":"Developing Indices for Detecting Glaucomatous Defects Using En Face RNFL Thickness","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170095\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        William Swanson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351 \n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Kevin Willeford","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/dynamic-visual-search-reveals-flexible-coupling-between-the-eye-and-hand","text":"Abstract\n\nPurpose:\nThe spatiotemporal linkage between the eye and hand has classically been viewed as eye-dominant: when a single goal is present, hand movements are initiated subsequent to saccadic target acquisition. However, the dynamic nature of our visual environment may necessitate flexible coordination between both effectors. Therefore, we used a paradigm in which the location of a target changes unpredictably to test the rigidity of the underlying neural circuitry.\n\nMethods:\nBoth eye and hand movements were recorded: following a fixation period, each participant was instructed to reach to a target in a pop-out visual search display. On half of the trials, the target stepped to a new location after a random delay (100 – 233 ms), thus rendering two outcomes possible: non-compensated movements, in which reaches were initiated towards the first target location, and compensated movements, in which the reach was executed directly towards the second target.\n\nResults:\nSaccadic target acquisition always preceded that of the hand and was highly correlated to the time at which non-compensated reaches changed course; however, a diverse array of behaviors to achieve this end were observed. For example, spatial coupling between both effectors was flexible: compensated and non-compensated reaches were accompanied by both single and sequential (e.g., non-target to target) saccades.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe interaction between ongoing target-selection and movement-initiation is highlighted in the current results. As the spatial location of the current goal is updated, movements with lower initiation thresholds (e.g., saccades) are more likely to be prematurely executed; conversely, higher thresholds (e.g., reaches) impart a time window for goal modification. This sensorimotor architecture allows rapid sampling of the visual environment until the spatial location of a movement goal is stable, an ability critical for optimal visuomotor performance.","title":"Dynamic Visual Search Reveals Flexible Coupling between the Eye and Hand","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175199\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Robert McPeek\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY State College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

We have postulated that a limited neural substrate results in reduced fusional divergence velocities and subsequently a reduced capacity to adapt tonic vergence to uncrossed disparities. We further investigated this hypothesis by characterizing the degree of plasticity in reflex vergence to repetitive end-point errors using a disparity based double-step paradigm.\n\nMethods:\n10 adults (26±3.8y/o) completed 4 study visits. Reflexive convergence or divergence was measured (250Hz infrared oculography) to a 2° disparity step and then lengthened or shortened via a repeated double-step (2°±1.5°).

In comparison, adaptive lengthening of convergence was slower (p 0.58, p<0.001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nAdaptive responses serving to increase or decrease reflexive vergence recruitment were asymmetric. Adaptive lengthening of convergence and divergence identified further directional asymmetries.

Ocular axial lengths (AL; high frequency A-scan ultrasonography) were measured weekly and OCT images captured monthly (Bioptigen SD-OCT). Maximum horizontal dimensions (ODDs), were measured from cross-sectional, 200×200 pixel images, using a custom MATLAB program; the termination of Bruch's membrane being used to define the OD boundary. RNFL was measured 400 µm from the center of the OD in four quadrants (nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior) of the en-face image.  A total of 4 RNFL readings were averaged to return a single thickness value.\n\nResults:\nAs expected, FD eyes elongated faster than their fellows over the treatment period (Table 1).  At week 12, the mean interocular difference in AL was 0.16 ±0.08 mm (p=0.05). ODDs appeared to increase with AL for myopic eyes (R\n2\n= 0.8651; p= 0.069), but these parameters were not significantly correlated for fellow eyes (R\n2\n= 0.73, p= 0.14). Similarly, RNFL thickness decreased with increasing AL for myopic eyes (R\n2\n= 0.99, p= 0.003), while these parameters were not significantly correlated for fellow eyes (R\n2\n= 0.66, p= 0.185).\n\nConclusion(s):\nOptic discs tended to increase in size and RNFLs to decrease in thickness with increasing AL in the myopic eyes of young guinea pigs, paralleling the trends reported for human myopia.

Reports suggest that outdoor activity may be protective against the development of myopia. In this preliminary study, the influence of outdoor activity dosage on choroidal thickness (ChT) was examined.\n\nMethods:\nStudents aged 18-24 (n=5 non-myopes, SER:+1.63 to -0.63D; n=8 myopes, -2.25 to -6.25D) participated during academic and non-academic periods. Subjects wore continuously recording light sensor devices (Actiwatch) on their non-dominant arm over clothes for 2 weeks.  Data were averaged over 1-min epochs, with white light intensity ≥1000 lux used as a proxy for time outdoors. Outdoor activity was characterized by average daily interval frequency and duration. ChT was objectively measured from EDI-OCT images (Cirrus) at several retinal positions (sub-foveal and 2250, 1500 and 750 mm nasal and temporal to fovea).\n\nResults:\nMyopes generally had thinner choroids than non-myopes at all locations, but especially at the N2250 location (21.84 mm thinner). Although not significant in this small dataset, more frequent outdoor intervals were correlated with thinner choroids, especially at temporal and foveal locations (R2: 0.43 to 0.54), as compared to nasal locations (R2: 0.16 to 0.29). Average interval duration was not correlated with ChT (all R2 < 0.35). Conversely, myopes went outdoors more frequently during non-academic periods (1.1-3.8 more times, daily), when their choroids were also thicker (up to 20%), compared to academic periods. However, ChT change was not strongly correlated to the increase in interval frequency in this dataset. Conclusions: Although this study is small, our findings suggest that outdoor activity may influence ChT and that the frequency of the activity may be important. These findings are also consistent with observations from animal studies, where the frequency of exposure to anti-myopia stimuli is known to influence the effectiveness in neutralizing myopia-genic stimuli.","title":"Choroidal Thickness is Influenced by Outdoor Activity Dosage","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175391\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California - Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Amanda Tran, Michelle Chan, Michelle Guillen, Jessica Hoang, Christine Wildsoet\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California at Berkeley, University of California at Berkeley, University of California at Berkeley, University of California at Berkeley, University of California at Berkeley School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E352\n                    \n            |#|"}

Targeting these suppressed pathways may harness the limited visual cortical plasticity necessary to improve binocular function in adult amblyopes. Inter-ocular balance (IOB) can be used to quantify this suppression. We compared two measures of IOB (Mansouri et al, 2008; Huang et al, 2009) during a perceptual learning experiment to determine how well the measures perform and agree with each other.\n\nMethods:\nTwo methods of IOB were adapted and assessed. The first is a Global Motion Random Dot Kinematogram (RDK) task (adapted from Mansouri et al, 2008), where coherently moving signal dots are presented to the amblyopic eye and randomly moving noise dots are presented to the fellow eye. The second is a Dichoptic Pattern Adjustment task (adapted from Huang et al, 2009), where sinusoidal gratings with equal spatial frequency are presented with 45 deg difference of phase to the left and right eyes, respectively. Subjects adjust interocular contrast ratio until the fused percept appears to align with a reference position. Nineteen amblyopic and mixed-mechanism amblyopes used both methods throughout a 10-session perceptual learning paradigm.\n\nResults:\nAcross anisometropic subjects, the two measures were correlated (r = 0.61, p  < 0.001). Both the global motion task and the pattern adjustment task are consistent measures of IOB across a single training session (r = 0.97 and r = 0.85, respectively; p < 0.001), when measured at the beginning and end of a 40 minute PL session. Additionally, both measures tended to show better balance over time in a 10-session stereoacuity PL training program. Conclusion: A high correlation between two different tasks suggests that a single mechanism, perhaps recognized clinically as suppression, contributes significantly to both types of imbalance. We propose that either measure can be used effectively to measure IOB and assess changes in balance through training.","title":"Assessing the Robustness of Measures of Inter-Ocular Balance (IOB)","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170003\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Benjamin Backus\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY State College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Central and peripheral corneal thicknesses and central PoLTT of each eye were measured by high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (ENVISU 2300; Bioptigen Inc.) before, during, and after lens wear. Tear exchange into the peripheral cornea after 20 minutes of lens settling was measured using Out-in method. 5µL of 2% FITC-Dextran was instilled outside the lens on the bulbar conjunctiva and time was recorded on the first sign of fluorescence into PoLTT. Tear mixing under the lens was measured with fluorogram and evaluated for the distribution of fluorescence intensity change over time.\n\nResults:\n\nThe central percent corneal thickness change (%CTΔ) after 5 hours of lens wear was 1.51 ± 0.97% (p < 0.01) and peripheral %CTΔ were 1.09±0.88% nasally and 1.18±0.92% temporally (p=0.118). The average PoLTT decreased by 25.53±16.47% after 5 hours. Majority of the corneal swelling and the lens settling occurred in the first two hours. No relationship was found between central %CTΔ and PoLTT. Thinner PoLTT had shorter Out-in time after 20 minutes of lens settling (p=0.045). Fluorescence decay rate increased from central to peripheral except in the superior quadrant during lens wear (p<0.01). Superior quadrant had the fastest decay rate and thinner PoLTT had faster decay rates (p < 0.01).\n\nConclusion(s):\nAfter 5 hours of scleral lens wear, there was no clinically significant difference in corneal swelling (central and peripheral) with various scleral clearances, which could affect tear exchange. However, post lens tear mixing can be overestimated by fluorescence decay rate due to lens settling dynamics.","title":"Examining Ocular Surface Changes and Tear Mixing under a Scleral Lens for Various Scleral Clearances","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170048\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UC Berkeley Clinical Research Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Bo Tan, Young Kim, Yixiu Zhou, Wing Li, Meng Lin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Clincial Research Center School of Optometry UC Berkeley, Clincial Research Center School of Optometry UC Berkeley, Clincial Research Center School of Optometry UC Berkeley, Clincial Research Center School of Optometry UC Berkeley, Clincial Research Center School of Optometry UC Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

{"_type":"dict","author":"Cameron Postnikoff","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/investigation-of-leukocytes-in-the-post-lens-tear-film-of-scleral-contact-lens-wearers","text":"Abstract\n\nPurpose:\nDuring sleep, there is an influx of hundreds of thousands of neutrophils into the tear film, and the mechanism of recruitment remains unknown. In scleral contact lens (ScCL) wear, the post-lens tear film has minimal exchange with the outside environment, akin to the closed eye. This investigation sought to determine if leukocytes are recruited into the post-lens tear film of habitual ScCL wearers.\n\nMethods:\nTwelve eyes from six habitual ScCL wearers were analyzed. Subjects arrived having worn lenses for at least 3.5 hours (average 4.9 hours). Lenses were then removed to ensure the post-lens tear fluid reservoir remained intact. 150µL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to wash the inside of the lens. Eyes were washed post-lens removal with 5mL of PBS per eye. Wash solutions were collected and leukocytes were then isolated and counted. Specifically, samples from the post-lens tear fluid were stained with fluorescently-labeled antibodies against CD45 (leukocytes), CD66b (neutrophils), CD19 (B cells), CD3 (T cells), CD4 (helper T cells), and CD8 (cytotoxic T cells). Flow cytometry was then performed.\n\nResults:\nSignificantly (\np\n< 0.01) more leukocytes were obtained from the post-lens tear reservoir (3611±4604) than from the eyewash after lens removal (394±445). The leukocyte composition was primarily neutrophilic in the post-lens tear film (73%). B cells and T cells represented 4% and 2% of the total leukocytes, respectively.\n\nConclusion(s):\nLeukocytes are present in the post-lens tear film of ScCL wearers. This is an important consideration for ocular surface homeostasis because it is indicative of a mild inflammatory response, which may be associated with mid-day ScCL fogging. Additional subjects are required to determine the effects of disease state and lens fit on leukocyte recruitment into the post-lens tear film.","title":"Investigation of Leukocytes in the Post-Lens Tear Film of Scleral Contact Lens Wearers","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170049\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        John Laurent, Andrew Pucker, Jason Nichols\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

The subnormal orthographic processing observed in these conditions suggests they would present clinically with longer a DOF. However, individuals with reading deficits have been observed to adopt skimming behaviors. To what extent these behaviors alter the expected DOF in these patients is unknown. We endeavored to determine the DOF profiles for VD and RF and analyze the effect of skimming on DOF in VD and RF.\n\nMethods:\nVisagraph results from 138 patients (89 VD;49 RF) ages 8-14 were analyzed. Frequency analysis was run to determine DOF profiles for VD and RF. Multivariate analysis of skimming behavior predicted by below normal fixation count at grade level was performed to identify the expected DOF associated with skimming behavior.\n\nResults:\nFrequency analysis determined the following DOF profiles in VD and RF respectively: longer 77.5%/36.7%, normal 18%/36.7% and shorter 4.5%/4.1%. The mean DOF for VD (0.0804) varied significantly from the mean DOF for RF (0.0431) (p = 0.025). Multivariate analysis revealed VD individuals with normal regressions had a mean DOF of 0.024, and those with above normal regressions had a mean DOF of 0.123 (p = 0.000). Analysis of individuals with RF deficit revealed those with normal regressions had mean DOF of 0.032, and those with above normal regressions had a mean DOF of 0.037 (p = 0.627).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe majority of both VD and RF individuals presented with a longer DOF. VD patients presented with a greater frequency of longer DOF and with a longer mean DOF compared to RF patients. This data aligns with research suggesting RF is a milder form of VD. In VD, DOF does vary significantly with skimming behavior, suggesting VD skimmers are fixating at less words but are doing so for a longer amount of time.","title":"Analysis of Duration of Fixation in Visual Dyslexic and Reading Fluency Deficit Patients","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170005\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Erin Brooks, Aaron Franzel\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UMSL College of Optometry, UMSL College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

For soft contact lens wearers, a significant change in LWE severity over time was detected; however, the observed changes in LWE staining may not be considered clinically significant.","title":"Longitudinal Variation in Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy in Contact Lens and Non-Contact Lens Wearers.","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170015\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carolina Kunnen\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

We studied whether the \"PRL\" that develops in response to a simulated scotoma in normally sighted individuals is the result of visuomotor adaptation, as is the case in patients with a real scotoma.\n\nMethods:\nExp. 1: We used a gaze-contingent paradigm to occlude the central 8° of the visual field of 8 normally sighted subjects (aged 18-25) to simulate a central scotoma. Subjects practiced a task (searched for a Tumbling E stimulus and identified its orientation) to learn how to cope with the simulated scotoma. Following training (~6300 trials), subjects were tested on their consistency in using their newly developed \"PRL\" for a saccade task. During this testing, the simulated scotoma was randomly removed for half of the trials. Exp. 2: 3 of the 8 subjects returned to be explicitly trained to use the \"PRL\" for saccadic eye movements. Training involved making saccades as fast as possible to place the \"PRL\" on a small target. After ~10000 trials, subjects were again tested for their consistency in using the \"PRL\".\n\nResults:\nExp. 1: Most subjects developed a \"PRL\" for fixation following training, but their saccades remained referenced to the fovea. During testing, when the simulated scotoma was absent, subjects reverted to using their fovea. Exp. 2: All subjects demonstrated the referencing of saccades to the \"PRL\" in the presence of the simulated scotoma following training. However, when the simulated scotoma was removed during testing, 2 of the 3 subjects reverted to using their fovea.\n\nConclusion(s):\nDespite the consistent use of a \"PRL\" for saccadic eye movements in the presence of a simulated scotoma, subjects automatically reverted to using their fovea when the scotoma was absent, suggesting that the \"PRL\" developed in response to the simulated scotoma likely represented a strategy, instead of a genuine visuomotor adaptation.","title":"Development of a “Preferred Retinal Locus” in Response to a Simulated Central Scotoma: Visuomotor Adaptation or Strategy?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170090\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Mehmet Agaoglu, Susana Chung\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California Berkeley School of Optometry, University of California Berkeley School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Research has shown that low contrast results in worse static and dynamic VA; however the impact of chromaticity on static and dynamic VA is unclear. This study examines the impact of contrast and chromaticity on DVA.\n\nMethods:\n42 participants were assigned to one of two study blocks: 1) Contrast (n=21), 2) Chromatic (n=21). Each block consisted of 2 study visits that were a minimum of 2 weeks apart. At each visit, DVA was measured using moV& (V&MP Vision Suite). Contrast block testing measured DVA at 44% and 10% contrast. Chromatic block testing measured DVA using a red target/white background and a white target/blue background. Within each block, tests were run with a constant target size (+0.8, +0.6, or +0.4 logMAR above static VA threshold) and increasing target speed, as well as with a constant target speed (1, 3, 6, 9, or 12m/s) with decreasing target size. Horizontal, vertical, oblique, and random walk motion trajectories were used. DVA and speed thresholds were compared between contrast levels and colour combinations.\n\nResults:\nAs target contrast decreased from 44% to 10%, DVA and speed threshold significantly worsened for all trajectories measured (p < 0.05). Overall, there was a significant effect of chromaticity on DVA with the white/blue combination yielding better DVA compared to red/white (mean logMAR DVA: red/white = 0.37 ± 0.19; white/blue = 0.33 ± 0.18, p < 0.05). However, chromaticity did not have a significant effect on speed threshold (p > 0.05).\n\nConclusion(s):\nDVA is worse at lower contrast and with red letters on a white background. Speed thresholds are also worse at low contrast, but chromaticity does not appear to impact speed thresholds on this task. Further investigation into additional chromaticity combinations is needed to better understand this phenomenon.","title":"The Effect of Optotype Contrast and Chromaticity on Dynamic Visual Acuity","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170084\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Natalie Hutchings, Trefford Simpson, Kristine Dalton\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

This noise related reduction in reading is not linked to reduced contrast sensitivity and could potentially measure cognitive change in various clinical groups. In this study we measure the noise related reduction in reading speed in three age groups.\n\nMethods:\nThirty two children (mean age and SD: 12.01 ± 3.97 years), forty five adult (mean age and SD: 31.11 ± 9.31 years), and twenty six elderly (68.0 ± 6.85 years) native English-speaking subjects participated in this study. They had normal distance visual acuity of 6/6 or better, and corrected near visual acuity N5 or better. Words were degraded using positional noise produced by random vertical displacements of letter position below or above the horizontal line for real and reversed words. Each vertical letter position was sampled from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance at 0, 0.3 and 0.60 x character height condition. Reading speed was recorded using a digital recording system and was scored as number of correct words counted per minute for six minutes (one minute for each noise variance).\n\nResults:\nReading speed for real and reversed words for all three age group were significantly (p < 0.05) slower at noise levels 0.3 & 0.6, when compared with the zero noise condition. Real word reading speed was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the elderly group (mean = 116 ± 18.8 words per minute (wpm)) compared with the adult (151.0 ± 15.2 wpm) and children (146 ± 17.3 wpm) groups but was influenced to a lesser extent by the introduction of positional noise.\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur results showed a significant impairment in reading speed for the elderly subject group which reduced with the introduction of positional noise.

We examined characteristics of children with VI to determine which are the best predictors of reading ability.\n\nMethods:\n35 children in kindergarten or 1rst grade with VI from varying causes were examined including vision tests, Woodcock Johnson III (WJ) subtests 1,2,9 & 13, Beery VMI, and RAN/RAS (rapid, automatized naming) color, letter and number tests. Associations with reading (WJ) were determined using ANOVA and Spearman rank correlations.\n\nResults:\nThe children were predominantly male (57%) and white (60%); 17 were in kindergarten.

Using a realistic task in a driving simulator, we examined detection of pedestrians by bioptic drivers around the time of telescope use and compared to detection when not using the telescope.\n\nMethods:\n12 bioptic users (17 – 80 y) used their own monocular telescopes to read highway road signs (n = 71 total) while driving in the simulator. They completed 3 drives with binocular viewing (when the fellow eye could potentially compensate for the ring scotoma) interleaved between 3 drives with monocular viewing (fellow eye patched so that it could not compensate). They pressed the horn whenever they saw a pedestrian; 14 pedestrians appeared when not using the bioptic and 26 when using the bioptic to read a sign. The latter were programed to appear on the road ahead of the driver, run for 1s within the ring scotoma area and then disappear during the expected period of bioptic use. Head movement data were used to determine the actual timing of the head dip to look at the sign through the bioptic, as well as whether the pedestrian appeared before or only while using the bioptic.\n\nResults:\nPedestrian detection rates were 97% in binocular and monocular viewing when not using the bioptic, decreasing to 74% in binocular and 56% in monocular viewing in bioptic events. When pedestrians appeared only while subjects were using the bioptic (and were most likely to be within the ring scotoma), detection rates were significantly lower in monocular than binocular viewing (43% vs. 75%, p < 0.001); but not when the pedestrian appeared just before subjects looked into the bioptic (69% vs. 71%, p = 0.44).\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur results suggest that under binocular viewing conditions the fellow eye was able to compensate for the ring scotoma when subjects used a monocular telescope to read road signs; however, performance was not as good as without the bioptic.","title":"Pedestrian Detection by Bioptic Drivers While Using Monocular Telescopes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170086\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Xiaolan Tang, P.

Subjects were asked to report as fast as possible the number of 1-3 light or dark targets (1 x1 degree squares) positioned at random in a binary noise background, within the central 30 degrees. Stimuli were presented using MATLAB and Psych-toolbox on a gamma calibrated monitor (Mitsubishi DP2070SB or Display ++ LCD).\n\nThe duration of each presentation was determined by the observer’s reaction time. Each hour long session results in a total of 600-800 presentations.\n\nResults:\nDark targets are detected faster and more accurately than lights in controls and early glaucoma. Comparing controls to early glaucoma, there were no significant differences in reaction time (RT) or accuracy for lights or darks. To investigate RT as a function of visual field MD, we used a method of moving average. A fixed boundary was set at the lowest MD.  Correlation was significant for both dark (p= 0.006) and light (p= 0.0007).  RT increased at a rate of 105 msec/dB for dark targets and 143 msec/dB for light targets. There was a consistent difference between dark and light RT (39 msec/dB).\n\nConclusion(s):\nOur results confirm that dark and light asymmetry in RT and accuracy are both preserved in early stages of glaucoma and suggest a more profound influence on the ON vs. OFF pathway.","title":"Light and Dark Target Detection in Early Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170094\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Muen Yang, Carmen Pons Torres, Mitchell Dul, Jose-Manuel Alonso\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry, SUNY College of Optometry, SUNY College of Optometry, SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects viewed tennis balls thrown (~80mph) from a pitching machine and called out the color and number on the ball. Eye movements (video tracker) and head movements (inertial sensor) were recorded. Eye and head data were synchronized to 6 known ball positions throughout the trajectory.\n\nResults:\nFor both the NE and IC groups, head movements in the direction of the ball were larger than eye movements. The NEs made larger head movements late in the pitch trajectory (t-test, p < 0.05) and larger eye movements as the ball arrived at the plate (t-test, p < 0.05)). Gaze errors for the NE and IC players were similar until late in the pitch trajectory, when gaze error was smaller for the NEs (t-test, p < 0.05). No difference in variability of head and eye movements was found for the NE and IC groups except for the eye as the ball crossed the plate (NE larger, Levene’s, p < 0.05). Head movements, eye movements, and gaze errors were then calculated for the NE sub-groups (None, LL, HS). The None group exhibited eye movements mostly opposite to the head throughout the pitch trajectory, and made larger head movements than the other NE groups.

Current studies assess FS for durations ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. However, the relationship between FS and fixation duration in people with macular disease remains unclear. Here, we report on the impact of duration of fixation recording on FS in subjects with bilateral macular disease.\n\nMethods:\n\nFixation in the better seeing eye of 19 participants (14 females, age: 55-94 years; best-corrected acuities: 20/42 - 20/304) with bilateral central vision loss was assessed using an OPKO OCT/SLO (theoretical sampling rate ~8 samples/second, pixel size 3.4 arcmin). Participants were instructed to keep the center of a 1 deg cross target visible during measurement. Fixation was recorded at least thrice for each of the 4 durations (5,10,15 or 20s) in a random sequence. Data files comprising the retinal coordinates of the fixation target were analyzed offline using custom MATLAB programs. FS was computed as the area enclosed by the 68% bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA) and cumulative density line (isoline area: ISOA).\n\nResults:\nThe FS computed as BCEA was not significantly different (p>0.05) from ISOA. Averaged across subjects, a) the total number(SD) of eye position samples were: 16(2.5), 30(5.5), 44(10.5) and 58(12.5) and b) ISOA(SD) in deg\n2\nwere: 0.71(1.48), 1.34(3.03), 1.52(2.01) and 1.37(1.78), for 5,10,15 and 20s of fixation recording, respectively. One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that recording duration did not have a significant effect on ISOA [F (3,72) = 0.53, p = 0.66].\n\nConclusion(s):\nThe absence of any effect of recording duration on FS might be due to fundamental limitations of the equipment (low sampling rate and missing samples) and may suggest that OPKO OCT/SLO is not a feasible option for the measurement of FS.","title":"Assessing Fixation Stability in Macular Degeneration – Does Recording Duration Matter?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170087\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Envision Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Mehmet Agaoglu, Susana Chung\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry University of California Berkeley CA, School of Optometry University of California Berkeley CA\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Netarsudil, potent Rho kinase inhibitor, may lower intraocular pressure (IOP) primarily by increasing trabecular meshwork outflow as well as by decreasing episcleral venous pressure (Kiel and Kopczynski. 2015; Wang et al. 2015). In 2 prior Phase 3 trials, netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% dosed once daily demonstrated efficacy in lowering IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or OHT (Katz et al., 2016; Bacharach et al., 2016). The objective of this study was to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% dosed QD (PM), OU, compared to Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% dosed BID (AM and PM), OU over a 6-month period. The primary endpoint of this study at 3 months; established the noninferiority of netarsudil to timolol (Khouri et. Al., 2017). We now report on findings at 6 months.\n\nMethods:\nThis was a double-masked, randomized, parallel-group trial in subjects with OAG or OHT treated with netarsudil 0.02% QD or timolol 0.5% BID. Subjects had unmedicated IOP >20 mmHg and < 30 mmHg at 08:00 hr, and > 17 mmHg and < 30 mmHg at 10:00 and 16:00 hrs.\n\nResults:\nRocket 4 enrollment totaled approximately 700 patients. The mean diurnal IOP in patients with a baseline IOP < 25 mmHg was similar at baseline between the treatment groups. At 3 months, mean diurnal IOPs were 17.15 and 16.93 mmHg in the netarsudil and timolol groups, respectively. Netarsudil performance at months four, five and six remained within the non-inferiority range compared to timolol at each of the (IOP) measurement time points, including 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 4 p.m. at baseline IOPs ranging from above 20 mmHg to below 25 mmHg and also from above 20 mmHg to below 27 mmHg. The most frequent adverse event was conjunctival hyperemia, which was reported in approximately 48% of patients in the netarsudil group. Conjunctival hyperemia, when present in patients in the netarsudil group, was predominately mild approximately 75%. No treatment-related systemic adverse events were reported for netarsudil. In the timolol group at month 6 there was a statistically significant reduction in mean heart rate by 2 - 3 beats per minute (average across all patients; p < 0.0001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nOnce-daily netarsudil has consistent and sustained IOP lowering efficacy as demonstrated in 3 Phase 3 pivotal trials. In the ROCKET 4 study, once-daily netarsudil was non-inferior to twice-daily timolol in patients with baseline IOP < 25 mm Hg at 3 months (primary). The Rocket 4 six-month efficacy results for netarsudil demonstrated a consistent level of IOP lowering across all baseline IOPs in the trial, and consistent IOP lowering throughout the six-month period.","title":"A Double-Masked, Randomized, Multi-Center, Active-Controlled, Parallel Group, 6-Month Study Assessing the Ocular Hypotensive Efficacy and Safety of Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution, 0.02% QD Compared to Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.5% BID","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170098\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Albert Khouri, Casey Kopczynski, Theresa Heah, Rick Lewis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Rutgers-New Jersey Med Sch Newark NJ, Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc, Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc, Sacramento Eye Consultants\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

In multivariate analyses, converters had higher baseline cup/disc (CD) asymmetry (r2=0.06, p=0.03), higher baseline inter-eye MT asymmetry (r2=0.07, p=0.03), higher rate of 24-2 visual field index (VFI) deterioration over time (r2=0.09, p=0.01), and higher rate of RNFL loss over time (r2=0.19, p2=0.11, p=0.003) and higher inter-eye RNFL asymmetry (r2=0.09, p=0.008). Total r2 for the first model was 0.40 while total r2 for the second model was 0.20.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn this study, conversion from glaucoma suspect to manifest glaucoma was predicted by greater baseline asymmetry of CD, RNFL, and MT along with higher rates of VFI and RNFL change over time. These parameters may be valuable tools for glaucoma risk assessment.","title":"Predicting Conversion from Glaucoma Suspect to Manifest Open-Angle Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170097\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Denise Pensyl, Suchitra Katiyar, James Esposito, Michael Sullivan-Mee\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VAMC, Albuquerque VAMC, Albuquerque VAMC, Albuquerque VAMC\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

We compared full color images, narrower band pseudo-color images, and OCT.\n\nMethods:\nWe consented 201 patients (54.4 + 11.4 yr, 54% female, 43% male) who received diabetic care after ACA onset at the Eastmont Wellness Center, Oakland, CA. We imaged subjects with a color fundus camera (Canon Cr-DGi), a Digital Light Ophthalmoscope (DLO) with 630 and 570 nm illumination (Aeon Imaging) scaled to achieve realistic pseudocolor, and NIR SD-OCT (iVue). An EyePACS certified grader used the ETDRS criteria to grade the Canon images. A senior ophthalmologist, also EyePACS certified, performed blind grading on the Canon and DLO image sets. Differences between the initial EyePACS grader and the senior grader were analyzed. Two additional graders rated color balances of DLO images that varied in the proportion of blue added to the pseudo-color images.\n\nResults:\nOur subjects were 59% Hispanic, 24% African American, 10% Asian, and 7% other. Vision threatening retinopathy was present, including 3 patients with NVD or NVE. Grading differences between the Canon and DLO images were mostly caused by differing grader criteria. In some dark eyes the choroidal vasculature was of high contrast on the DLO compared to ETDRS standards from a largely Caucasian population, leading to over-reporting of IRMA. OCT disambiguated vitreo-retinal traction. A realistic color balance over was achieved over all retinal areas in a large proportion of DLO images. Images with added blue were preferred by 1 or 2 graders (p < .0001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nDark fundi require improved instructions in grading for diabetic retinopathy. Dark fundi can have a very different choroidal appearance on DLO that might be confused with IRMA or NV. The diagnosis of IRMA should be accompanied by additional diabetic retinal vascular signs.","title":"Grading Color Fundus Images in Underserved Diabetics","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170061\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Thomas Gast, Durand Jones, Bryan Haggerty, Brett King, Christopher Clark, Jeffrey Clendenon, Taras Litvin, Glen Ozawa, Jorge Cuadros, Matthew Muller\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Aeon Imaging LLC Indiana University, Indiana University, Indiana University, INdiana University, Indiana University, Aeon Imaging LLC, University of California Berkeley, UC Berkeley School of Optometry, UC Berkeley School of Optometry, Aeon Imaging LLC\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

We investigated the extent to which cognitive distraction involving a memory task impairs peripheral detection in older and younger observers.\n\nMethods:\nYounger (18-40 y; n = 24) and older (60+ y; n = 24) normally sighted subjects viewed images of T-intersections from the viewpoint of a driver approaching the intersection. Each image, presented for 250 ms to simulate a single fixation, contained a motorcycle (2.1° high) located at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30° to the left or right of the central fixation point, with or without other traffic. Subjects indicated the side on which the motorcycle appeared (peripheral detection task), while simultaneously completing a central task presented at the fixation point. There were three levels of cognitive load (distraction): no load (fixate central cross), low load (read out a random letter at fixation) or high cognitive load (state the letter seen on the previous trial). Thus cognitive load was increased without changing visual demands.\n\nResults:\nPeripheral detection rates declined significantly more quickly with increasing eccentricity for older than younger subjects (p < .001). Low load reduced detection rates of older subjects by 6% at all eccentricities (p < .001), while high load reduced detection rates by 17% (p < .001). Detection rates of younger subjects were not affected by low load (p = .96), but reduced by 8% at all eccentricities in the high load condition (p < .001). A three-way interaction between load, age and eccentricity suggested that older subjects reached the limit of their dual-tasking capabilities sooner than younger subjects (p < .001).\n\nConclusion(s):\nCognitive distraction had a greater effect on peripheral detection rates of older than younger subjects. Performing a straightforward memory task substantially reduced detection rates of older drivers even when the target was only 5° from fixation.","title":"The Effects of Age and Cognitive Distraction on Peripheral Detection at Intersections","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170065\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lauren Spano, Lily Zhang, Dora Pepo, Mahedi Islam, Steven Savage\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute, Schepens Eye Research Institute, New England College of Optometry, Karolinska Instituet, Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Contrast sensitivity (CS), color vision, reaction time and electro-diagnostic tests also are important to assess performance.\n\nOur purpose was to identify single or multiple tests of central vision which best identify individuals with optimal capability to excel in challenging visually guided tasks such as marksmanship.\n\n\nMethods:\nETDRS VA, small letter (20/25) CS, distance cone specific color CS with reaction time, macular pigment optical density, Diopsys® pattern, multi-focal, and photopic negative response ERGs and VEPs were conducted on 30 visually normal young adults (mean age ± SD = 25.7 ± 3.1 years, 14 male). Measurements were repeated twice and means used for analyses. Vision testing was followed by a Nintendo®Wii shooting task which measured marksmanship as an accuracy score and total time for completion. Accuracy scores were divided by completion time to determine\n\nthroughput\n\nfor each subject; a composite metric which includes both accuracy and time. Multiple regression was used to determine which tests best predicted marksmanship throughput.\n\n\nResults:\n\nSurprisingly conventional tests including VA, CS, color vision, macular pigment and VEPs were not predictive of throughput (mean r\n2\n\n= 0.02, p>0.4).

This study was therefore designed to evaluate relationships between NEI-VFQ-25 QOL subscale scores and both 24-2 and 10-2 VF parameters.\n\nMethods:\nAll subjects were participating in a longitudinal glaucoma research study at the Albuquerque VA Medical Center, and for this investigation, were diagnosed either primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or glaucoma suspect (GS). POAG subjects had glaucomatous optic neuropathy with repeatable VF loss while GS subjects had ocular hypertension and/or optic nerve appearance that was suspicious for glaucoma but no repeatable VF loss. The NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire, a Rasch-validated QOL survey instrument consisting of 25 questions that probes 12 separate subscales of everyday visual function, was administered to each subject and subscale QOL scores were then calculated. All subjects completed 24-2 and 10-2 VF testing within 6 months of completing the NEI-VFQ-25. Relationships between subscale QOL scores and both the better and worse eye as defined by mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) on the 24-2 and 10-2 VF tests were investigated using linear regression analyses.\n\nResults:\nOne hundred twenty-six subjects (54 GS, 72 POAG) were analyzed. Of the 12 subscale scores, difficulties with peripheral vision, driving, and visual stamina were most commonly associated with VF metrics. Compared to worse-eye VF parameters, better-eye VF parameters were more frequently associated with QOL subscale scores, with better-eye 24-2 MD correlated with more QOL subscale scores (8/12) than any other VF parameter (r-squared values ranged from 0.08 to 0.17). The highest QOL subscale score/VF parameter correlations were between worse-eye VF parameters and peripheral vision QOL scores (r-squared values ranged from 0.15 to 0.22).\n\nConclusion(s):\nBetter-eye VF parameters were correlated with most QOL subscale scores, suggesting that better-eye 24-2 and 10-2 VF parameters are important for predicting specific aspects of real-world visual disability in glaucoma. Worse-eye VF parameters may also provide value, particularly for predicting peripheral vision disability in glaucoma.","title":"Relationship between Subscale Quality of Life Scores and 10-2 and 24-2 Glaucomatous Visual Field Loss","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170096\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Denise Pensyl, Suchitra Katiyar, James Esposito, Nimesh Patel, Michael Sullivan-Mee\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New Mexico VA Medical Center, New Mexico VA Medical Center, New Mexico VA Medical Center, New Mexico VA Medical Center, New Mexico VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Recently we reported that contour interaction is reduced under mesopic luminance. Here we examine how crowding affects clinical measurements of mesopic visual acuity, as well as test-retest repeatability.\n\nMethods:\nLogMAR acuity was measured in 20 normal observers using custom letter charts, comprising 3 horizontal rows with 5 black Sloan letters each, centered on the white background of a display monitor. Letter size decreased from the upper to the lower row using a 0.05 logMAR step size. Monocular best-corrected acuity was measured under photopic (228 cd/m2) and mesopic (0.164 cd/m2) luminance conditions. A calibrated ND filter and pinhole, housed in light tight goggles, were used to produce the mesopic condition. To assess crowding, horizontal edge-to-edge spacing between adjacent letters was either 100%, 50%, 20% or 10% of the optotype size. Vertical row spacing was fixed at the inter-optotype spacing of the row below. For each condition, presented in random order, observers read the letters on the middle row only, from left to right. Measurements continued by reducing the size of the letters in 0.05 logMAR steps, until 3 or more errors were made on a single row. Final visual acuity was determined using letter-by-letter scoring.\n\nResults:\nLogMAR acuity was significantly better under photopic than mesopic luminance conditions (p < 0.05). Consistent with the known effect of crowding, logMAR increased with decreasing letter spacing; however, the increase was less under mesopic luminance conditions (p < 0.05). Test-retest repeatability for mesopic and photopic conditions was not significantly different (less than 0.1 logMAR for both mesopic and photopic conditions).\n\nConclusion(s):\nMesopic visual acuity exhibits less crowding than photopic visual acuity. Our results have practical implications for the accurate measurement of mesopic acuity, such as in monitoring disease and in research.","title":"Visual Acuity is Less Crowded at Mesopic than Photopic Luminance","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170081\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Anglia Ruskin University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Frantisek Pluhacek, Jitka Ostadalova\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Faculty of Science Palacky University Olomouc Czech Repub, Faculty of Science Palacky University Olomouc Czech Repub\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Here, we investigate the effects of flanking stimuli of different spatial configurations on depth discrimination off the horopter.\n\nMethods\n: Five adults with normal visual and stereo acuity participated. Stereoscopic test and reference stimuli comprised thin luminous vertical bars displayed on a high resolution monitor using a shutter goggle system. Observers responded to the perceived depth of the test stimulus, either in front or behind the reference. Depth discrimination thresholds were measured for different flanker separations and for conditions both on and off the horopter. Thresholds were calculated using Probit analysis from the proportion of correctly identified ‘in front’ responses for each condition.\n\nResults\n: When flankers were placed close to the test, but gradually displaced off the horopter, crowding systematically reduced as test-flanker depth separation off the horopter increased up to about 0.5’ or 1’; however, crowding returned for larger test-flanker depth disparities beyond 1’. On the contrary, when flankers were laterally separated from the test, to minimize crowding on the horopter, crowding became evident as flankers were moved off the horopter with increasing flanker disparity, and decreased with incongruent flanker width. Similar results were found when the whole stimulus configuration was displaced off the horopter.\n\nConclusion\n: Our results confirm previous reports showing that depth discrimination thresholds increase in the presence of flanking bars, but suggest that disparity integration relative to the fixation plane maybe be tuned to a dichotomy of fine scales around the horopter, and broader scales farther away, driven by mechanisms of salience attraction. Crowding is also reduced by depth cues related to the width, and disparity of flanking stimuli.","title":"Stereoscopic Depth Crowding Is Tuned around the Horopter","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170082\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        College of Health and Allied Sci., Univ. of Cape Coast, Gh.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        John Siderov, Ebi Osuobeni\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Anglia Ruskin University, Anglia Ruskin University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

The biofilms were initially quantified via colony forming units (CFU) counts. After removal of loosely adherent cells, the coupons were submerged into a hydrogen peroxide-based care solution (Oxysept UltraCare Formula) for 6 h. Serial dilutions of the recovered biofilm solution were made and each dilution was plated onto tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and incubated for 72 h at 37°C. The number of surviving bacteria were then quantified to assess kill reduction differences.\n\nResults\n: Both SA and PA attached and tightly adhered to the polystyrene coupons after 18 h of incubation in the 4 different nutrient conditions. Using the coupons in an antimicrobial efficacy evaluation, it was shown that the bacteria on the untreated coupons could be recovered. Efficacy of the peroxide-based solution was clearly demonstrated as it achieved complete kill of the biofilms formed under the four nutrient conditions (p < 0.05 for hydrogen peroxide compared to untreated coupons).\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis study successfully demonstrated an economical method, using polystyrene coupons, toward standardizing biofilm testing for contact lens solutions. It challenges the current FDA protocol and calls for a more rigorous method to test products under conditions that are a closer representation of the real world. Results of biofilm testing could provide critical information on the efficacy of disinfectants that current protocols are not able to demonstrate.","title":"Efficacy of a Peroxide-Based Contact Lens Care Solution Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus Aureus Biofilms Formed Under Four Different Nutrient Conditions","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170026\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Contact Lens Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sarah Khalid, David McCanna, Lyndon Jones\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        CCLR School of Optometry & Vision Science Uni of Waterloo, CCLR School of Optometry & Vision Science Uni of Waterloo, CCLR School of Optometry & Vision Science Uni of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, these studies employed paper contrast sensitivity charts for these measurements. Paper charts may be less sensitive than electronically presented stimuli. The purpose of this study was to investigate contrast sensitivity in age-matched normal and early to intermediate AMD patients with similar acuity with the electronic Beethoven contrast sensitivity system.\n\nMethods:\nTwenty-one subjects took part in this study (11 AMD age 78.4 ± 7.49 and 10 normal controls age 75.2 ± 5.75; p = 0.53). All subjects had a complete eye exam (VA, fields, OCT, fundus photos). The logMAR visual acuities for the test eye were not significantly different between the groups (AMD = 0.09 ± 0.098; Control = 0.03 ± 0.043; p = 0.127). The AMD patients were grades 2 – 4 (simplified AREDS scale average = 3.3 ± 0.65). A Beethoven system was used which employed a descending method of limits combined with a 2 AFC technique to determine contrast sensitivity. The stimulus (presented at the fovea or 4 deg nasal or temporal from the fovea) was a sine wave grating viewed from 200 cm on a ViewPixx monitor (100 cd/m2). Eight spatial frequencies (0.75 – 18.50 cpd) were tested. The contrast sensitivity functions were fit with a double exponential function. The subjects wore their optimal correction for the viewing distance.\n\nResults:\nThere was no significant difference between the AMD and control patients for visual acuity, visual fields, or macular pigment density. The average foveal contrast sensitivity functions were not significantly different for all of the AMD and control patients (ANOVA, p = 0.59). There was a decrease in contrast sensitivity (p = 0.009) when the control patients were compared to the 4 AMD patients with acuity worse than 0.14 logMAR. There was no difference in contrast sensitivity between the AMD and control patients at 4 deg nasal (p = 0.15) or temporal (p = 0.75) from the fovea.\n\nConclusions:\nPhotopic foveal contrast sensitivity functions are not significantly different for control and AMD patients with good acuity. Peripheral contrast sensitivity functions may not be different between normal and AMD patients because of the poor contrast sensitivity at this retinal location in normal patients (i.e., a floor effect).","title":"Central and Peripheral Contrast Sensitivity in AMD and Age Matched Control Patients","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170092\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        So.

The film stability is monitored using a camera, dome illumination and live video analysis. The lens is repeatedly submerged and emerged to generate a new film, mimicking the blinking action of the eye. In this study, four study lens types (Acuvue Oasys (AO), 1-Day Acuvue Moist (1DAM), Air Optix Aqua (AOA) and 1-Day Pure Moisture (S1PM)) were studied over a 6-hour cycling period (mean film break-up time (FBUT) recorded). Fifteen subjects were also recruited for a 4-visit, randomised, double-masked, non-dispensing study, where at each visit the subject wore a pair of study lenses for 30 minutes. Non-invasive break-up time (NIBUT) was assessed using the Keeler Tearscope.\n\nResults:\nThe WAVE system was consistently able to assess film stability over repeated immersion cycles. The average median FBUT (± standard deviation) for S1PM, 1DAM, AO, AOA were 25.4 ± 20.2, 161.8 ± 14.3, 141.8 ± 27.2 and 107.5 ± 74.4 seconds. The mean NIBUT for S1PM, 1DAM, AO, AOA were 11.3 ± 5.8, 8.8 ± 5.3, 7.9 ± 6.6 and 7.5 ± 3.9 seconds.\n\nConclusion(s):\nClinically relevant differences were observed in the NIBUT between the four study lenses. Comparison of the clinical NIBUT with the FBUT showed similar rank order for three of the lens types (AO, 1DAM and AOA), although the WAVE system did not predict the clinical performance for the S1PM lens type. These findings suggest that the WAVE system has some ability to predict on-eye performance, although further work is needed to fully understand these observations and to better model the complex and dynamic ocular environment.","title":"Can in Vitro Contact Lens Wettability Measures Predict Clinical Pre-Lens Tear Film Stability?","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170028\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carole Maldonado-Codina, Chantal Coles Brennan Coles Brennan, Philip Morgan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The University of Manchester, Johnson & Johnson Vision Inc., The University of Manchester\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Direct visualization of the ocular vasculature affords the unique opportunity to study vascular health in vivo. The use of enhanced-depth imaging (EDI) coupled with high-resolution SD-OCT allows for visualization of the choroid and quantification of subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT). This study quantifies SFCT among a cohort of US Veterans and analyzes its relationship with common systemic vascular disease states, CVD risk factors, and clinical & laboratory markers of CVD.\n\nMethods:\n150 U.S. Veterans were consented to participate in the study on the same day as their routine eye exam. Participants with primary eye disease, spherical-equivalent refractive error (RE) greater than 5D, and best-corrected vision <20/40 were excluded, as were participants who did not have primary care and laboratory data available over the past 2 years. Best-corrected vision, RE, and intraocular pressure were obtained from chart review of the same-day eye exam. A fundus photo was obtained to document absence of eye disease and the eye exam was used to verify absence of disease. Medical history and laboratory data were obtained from chart review and quantitative values were averaged over 2 years for data analysis. A questionnaire was used to gather data on smoking habits. Blood pressure was obtained and axial length (AL) was estimated using ultrasonography over the closed eyelid. The Heidelberg SD-OCT’s enhanced depth imaging (EDI) feature was used to image the choroid and SFCT was measured using the software’s measurement caliper. Average SFCT of 3 scans was used for data analysis. Central macular thickness (CMT) and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) were also obtained by SD-OCT and averaged from 3 scans for data analysis.\n\nResults:\nSix participants were excluded due to presence of primary eye disease meeting exclusion criteria or because imaging quality was poor. Age and RE independently impacted SFCT but not AL or time of day. CMT and RNFLT did not correlate with SFCT. DM diagnosis was associated with thinner SFCT (p\n\nConclusion(s):\nDiagnoses which impose CVD risk impact the morphology of the choroidal vasculature, as detected by SD-OCT.

The present study was aimed at evaluating a modified version of this treatment protocol for strabismic amblyopia.\n\nMethods:\nTen adults with strabismic amblyopia participated in the study. Crowded visual acuity ranged from 20/25-20/125. In the training phase, the participants were required to play 3D first-person shooter video games for a total of 40 hours, 2 hours per session, over 4-6 weeks. For strabismic patients, the misalignment of the two eyes was fully corrected using prism lenses. The fellow sound eye was blurred with Bangerter foils. A 32-inch active 3D television was used to display stereoscopic game content with a Sony PlayStation 3 system. A pair of liquid crystal shutter glasses enabled stereo images to be delivered to each eye. We measured a range of visual functions in pre-training and post-training sessions. These visual tasks included visual acuity and stereoacuity.\n\nResults:\nAfter 40 hours of 3D video game play, our participants showed improvement in visual acuity, on average ~1 lines (~20%) on a LogMAR letter chart, for both crowded letters and single letters. All participants gained substantial improvements, averaging 33%, in stereoacuity for a range of spatial frequencies (1 to 10 cpd).\n\nConclusion(s):\nHere we show that playing 3D video games can be effective in improving visual acuity. Importantly, unlike monocular video games, 3D video games can also improve stereoacuity in patients with strabismic amblyopia. Our findings suggest that stereoscopic video games might have potential therapeutic value in the recovery of reduced stereopsis in amblyopia, and possibly other neurological disorders.","title":"A Novel Binocular Technique for Treatment of Strabismic Amblyopia Using 3D Video Games","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170001\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Betty Li, Diana Chau, Michelle Antonucci, John Bui, Charlie Ngo, Dennis Levi, Roger Li\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California Berkeley School of Optometry, University of California Berkeley School of Optometry, University of California Berkeley School of Optometry, University of California Berkeley School of Optometry, University of California Berkeley School of Optometry, University of California Berkeley School of Optometry, University of California Berkeley School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Emerging research suggests an association between binocular vision and reading; however, research also shows a correlation between reading and fine motor skills. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between binocular visual function and fine motor task performance in a cohort of school-age children identified with a reading problem.\n\nMethods:\nParticipants (n=17; age: 5.58-11.75 years, 10 males) who were identified by their teacher as reading two grade levels below expected age and had normal visual acuity (≤0.00 logMAR), underwent a binocular vision assessment and performed two manipulation tasks (peg board and bead threading) under binocular and monocular viewing conditions. The main outcome measure for the manipulation task was movement time to complete the task. A correlation analysis was conducted to assess 1) the association between age and measures of binocular visual function and 2) the association between motor performance and binocular vision during both viewing conditions.\n\nResults:\nBoth binocular and monocular bead-threading performance was found to have a moderate correlation with accommodative facility (AF) (r= -0.58, p=0.022 binocular viewing; r= -0.57, p=0.022 monocular viewing), and a significant association with peg board task performed monocularly (r= -0.53, p=0.043). The association between AF and binocular peg board (r= -0.46, p=0.085) was not statistically significant. All other binocular vision results (stereoacuity, horizontal fusional reserves at near, and amplitude of accommodation) were also not associated with motor performance.\n\nConclusion(s):\nThis study provides evidence to show binocular visual function, specifically accommodative facility, is associated with both motor skill performance and academic achievement in reading.","title":"The Association between Binocular Vision and Fine Motor Skills in Children with Reading Difficulties","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170004\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo, Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ewa Niechwiej-Szwedo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Department of Kinesiology University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Minimum inhibitory concentrations for various antibiotic classes were determined using broth microdilution methodology according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Isolates were classified as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant based on established breakpoints and were categorized into West (W), Midwest (MW), South (S), and Northeast (NE) regions based on state of origin. One-way analyses of variance and Tukey’s test for pairwise differences were performed to evaluate antibiotic resistance by geographic region using the means of the percentage of drug classes to which each isolate was resistant.\n\nResults\nEighty-seven centers contributed 1695 S. aureus, 1475 CoNS, 474 S. pneumoniae, 586 H. influenzae, and 599 P. aeruginosa isolates from 2009-2016.

However, it is not well understood if this pro-inflammatory risk factor affects visual acuity outcomes after treatment with anti-VEGF. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships among Y402H status, visual acuity (VA), and anti-VEGF treatment outcomes.\n\n\n\nMethods:\nPatients with AMD receiving anti-VEGF injections were recruited from the retina service at the Ohio State University. VA was measured at the initiation of a series of anti-VEGF injections and one year later using a back-lit ETDRS chart with by-letter scoring. DNA was isolated from blood samples using Qiagen’s DNeasy kit and SNP status determined with a custom TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between SNP status and outcomes.\n\n\n\nResults:\nSixty-seven patients (50.7% female) were enrolled with a mean ± SD age of 82 ± 9 years.  Mean visual acuity of the treated eye was 45 ± 23 letters at time of enrollment. 21% of patients did not have Y402H risk factor, 54% were heterozygous, and 25% were homozygous. Visual acuity at baseline and one year was significantly associated with SNP status, with decreased VA for heterozygotes and a further reduction for homozygotes. Mean change in VA from baseline to one year for all subjects was –4 ± 12 letters. Y402H status was not associated with change in VA at one year.\n\n\n\nConclusions:\nThe presence of Y402H was associated with poorer VA at baseline and one year. The lack of apparent association of Y402H status with change in VA with treatment may be due to differences in factors such as AMD stage and previous treatments at time of the baseline visit. Further work will investigate the role of these factors in addition to Y402H status in determining treatment outcomes.","title":"Complement Factor H Genotype and Vision in Patients Being Treated for Neovascular AMD","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170091\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        San-San Cooley, Ellen Segerstrom, Frederick Davidorf, Bradley Dougherty\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University, The Ohio State University, The Ohio Staet University, The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

In this double-masked randomized clinical trial, we compared the effectiveness of a binocular falling-blocks videogame to a placebo videogame in older children and adults with amblyopia.\n\nMethods\n: From Mar 2014 to Jun 2016, participants with anisometropic, strabismic, or mixed mechanism amblyopia and amblyopic eye VA of 0.30-1.00 logMAR were recruited from university-based sites in Auckland, Waterloo, Montreal, Melbourne, and Hong Kong. Where needed, participants completed up to 16 weeks of optical treatment before randomization. Participants were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 6 weeks of 1 hour/day home-based active or placebo game training, stratified by age group (7-12 years, 13-17 years, and 18+ years). The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye VA at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included stereoacuity, suppression, and compliance.\n\nResults\n: A total of 115 participants were randomized. Amblyopic eye VA improved by a mean of 0.06 logMAR (SD 0.12) in the active group (n=56) and 0.07 logMAR (SD 0.10) in the placebo group (n=59). The adjusted group mean difference of -0.02 logMAR (95% CI -0.06-0.02 logMAR) was not statistically significant (p=0.25). No significant effects were found for age group, gameplay duration, prior occlusion treatment, or presence of strabismus. Thirty-six participants (64%) in the active group and 49 (83%) in the placebo group completed at least 25% of prescribed treatment. There were no significant differences between active and placebo groups for any secondary visual outcomes. Adverse events included 3 reports of mild transient asthenopia.\n\nConclusion(s):\nIn this clinical trial, the active binocular videogame did not produce a treatment effect and thus was not different from placebo. This highlights the difficulty of translating laboratory-based treatment to a home-based intervention. More engaging games may be required for successful at-home treatment.","title":"Findings from the Binocular Treatment of Amblyopia Using Videogames (BRAVO) Randomized Clinical Trial","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170002\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

The DYS had been diagnosed with dyslexia in the Learning Disabilities Program at Boston Children’s Hospital; the TR were recruited from the optometry clinic and local community. The majority of the children with dyslexia (23/29) had scores at least 1 SD below the mean by published norms on at least 2 of the following tests - word identification (WI), word attack (WA) and spelling. All TR had WI, WA and spelling scores that were in the average range. All children had a complete cycloplegic eye exam with a detailed BV assessment of vergence (amplitude, fusional ranges and facility), accommodation (amplitude, facility and accuracy of response) and tracking (Visagraph and Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test). Near work related symptoms were assessed using the convergence insufficiency symptom survey (CISS).\n\nResults:\nThe distribution of eye alignment was significantly different between the two groups with higher proportion of ‘eso’ deviation (44.8%) in the DYS compared to ‘exo’ deviation (54.5%) in the TR. Accommodation and vergence deficits were more frequent (p=0.00) in the DYS (62.1%) compared to the TR (18.8%). On the DEM test for the error score and on the Visagraph for reading rate, fixations and regression, 2/3\nrd\nof the DYS  had scores below the 25\nth\npercentile of the TR range (p=0.00).  The mean CISS score was 3.12 ± 2.56 and 15.45 ± 7.16 in the TR and DYS respectively.\n\nConclusion(s)\n: Deficits in BV function were prevalent in the DYS compared to TR in this study. Further research is required to determine if management of these deficits improves symptoms and visual function when reading in dyslexic children.","title":"Binocular Visual Function in Children with Dyslexia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        170006\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Boston Children's Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sowjanya Gowrisankaran, Emily Swanson, Deborah Waber\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Boston Childrens Hospital, Boston Childrens Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital & Harvard Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        E351\n                    \n            |#|"}

Practitioners usually use publicly available image processing software to analyze OCTA images. This study compared vessel density results obtained using ImageJ with those obtained using a software recently launched by a manufacturer.\n\nMethods:\nA Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT 5000 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) was used to measure the retinal vasculature of 21 eyes from 21 healthy young subjects. A 3x3mm OCTA image was acquired and analyzed using AngioPlex software. The retinal vessel perfusion density in the superficial plexus was provided according to a ETDRS grid. OCTA images were exported using three different settings of brightness (120 from a 255 gray scale, 140/255 and 180/255), followed by a manual calculation of the vessel density by using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Images were first converted into a binary format and were then analyzed using an automated thresholding method. Two OCTA images were acquired to study the repeatability for evaluating the vessel density.\n\nResults:\nUsing AngioPlex software, the median perfusion density at a 3mm ETDRS circle was 0.373 (IQR 0.034). No significant difference was observed between the two measurements, 0.376 (0.013) (Wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.60). The vessel density obtained using ImageJ depended on the brightness setting applied when exporting the images. The densities were 0.380 (0.042), 0.346 (0.030) and 0.299 +/- 0.040 at brightness settings of 120/255, 140/255, and 180/255, respectively. Only images obtained in the 120/255 setting had vessel density similar to those obtained using AngioPlex (Wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.06). The vessel density was significantly lower at other brightness settings. AngioPlex software also provided repeatable results for the perimeter and circularity of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). Significant variation was observed between the two measurements for the FAZ area (mean difference 0.006mm², 95% CI 0.001 to 0.011mm²; paired t-test, t = 2.65, p = 0.015).\n\nConclusion(s):\nWhen built-in software is not provided, practitioners may use publicly available image processing software to analyze the vessel density obtained from OCTA. For repeatability or follow-up studies, the same setting should be used when exporting OCTA images. Practitioners should be cautious when comparing the results obtained using publicly available image processing software.","title":"Variability in Retinal Vessel Density Using Manufacturer Software and Publicly Available Image Processing Software in Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175119\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Hong Kong Polytechnic University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ho-yin Wong\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

Over the past couple of years, the use of OCTA has provided insights into structural and functional vascular characteristics of various retinal and optic nerve disorders including ischemic optic neuropathies.\n\nCase Report:\nWe present a case of chronic non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION) that showed sectoral decreased peripapillary capillary density on OCTA, which is in agreement with findings reported by multiple studies. The correlation of the OCTA with the nerve fiber layer (NFL), ganglion cell complex (GCC), and visual field loss will be discussed, as well as the significance of this correlation in terms of eliciting the underlying process.\n\nDiscussion:\nOptic neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of optic nerve disorders that require different management within different timelines, but yet many have similar ophthalmoscopic presentation, usually as optic disc edema or atrophy. The characterization of these various disorders using OCTA could provide a tool that would facilitate their differential diagnosis, allowing for prompt and accurate management of the condition. Furthermore, more insights into the ischemic process and loss of peripapillary capillaries in relation to NFL and visual field loss may shed light into the underlying pathophysiology, opening doors to new treatment modalities in the future.","title":"Decreased Peripapillary Capillary Density Corresponding to AION-related NFL, GCC and Visual Field Loss Using OCT Angiography","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2017\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        175122\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Rim Makhlouf, Margaret Wilczek\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University, Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hall D\n                    \n            |#|"}

The primary outcome measure was the cumulative probability of \"suboptimal surgical outcome,\" defined as exotropia ≥ 10Δ or constant esotropia ≥ 6Δ at distance or near by simultaneous prism & cover test, or decreased stereoacuity of ≥2 octaves from baseline, at ANY 6-month masked examination from 6 months to 3 years after surgery. Reoperation was allowed by protocol only after meeting suboptimal outcome criteria; however, when reoperation was performed without meeting criteria, it was considered a suboptimal surgical outcome for analysis.\n\nResults:\nThe cumulative probability of suboptimal surgical outcome was 45.9% (43 of 101) and 37.3% (33 of 96) in the BLRc and R/R groups, respectively (difference = 8.6%; 95% CI, -5.8% to 23.0%).
