The prevalence of DPD deficiency in Caucasians is 3%-5%.\nrn\nBetween 10-40% of patients will develop severe toxicity early during treatment with fluoropyrimidines, which leads to a discontinuation of treatment.

In multiple cancer types, the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a resistance marker for TMZ; MGMT promoter methylation is associated with loss of MGMT expression and response to TMZ. We hypothesized that mCRC patients whose tumors expressed quantities of MGMT protein below a pre-defined cutoff would have better outcomes on TMZ than patients with MGMT expression above the cutoff. To test our hypothesis, we assessed MGMT by mass spectrometry in the tumor samples of patients with refractory mCRC and MGMT promoter methylation receiving TMZ.\n","topics":";Topics;;;Gastrointestinal Cancers;;Colon and Rectal Cancer;;","citation":" Citation  Annals of Oncology (2017) 28 (suppl_3): iii13-iii136. 10.1093/annonc/mdx261 ","session":" Session  ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2017 ","date":" Date  28 June 2017 ","title":"Selecting patients with metastatic colorectal cancer for treatment with temozolomide using proteomic analysis of MGMT","event":" Event  ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2017 "}

In melanoma treated with immunomodulatory agents, pseudoprogression has been reported in upwards of 15% of patients, while the rate is closer to 2-3% in NSCLC and HNSCC.

There is uncertainty with regards to the prognostic value of achieving ypCR. In addition, the prognostic value of fluoropyrimidine-containing adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) after radical surgery is still an area for debate. In this retrospective study, we aimed at identifying prognostic markers of tumour recurrence and survival of patients with LARC who were treated with NACRT and surgery.\n\nMethods:\nWe included patients with LARC, diagnosed in Manitoba between January 2007 and December, 2012 who were treated with NACRT followed by radical surgery. The patients were identified from the Provincial Cancer Registry database. Data on patient demographics, tumour characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Cox regression and competing risk models were used to predict survival and recurrence.\n\nResults:\n280 patients were identified with a median age of 61 years. Two thirds of the cohort were males. 82 patients (29.29%) had stage I-II and 198 patients (70.71%) had stage III rectal adenocarcinoma. All patients received 3D conformal neoadjuvant radiotherapy to the pelvis with a total dose of 45-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions. 5 fluorouracil-based chemotherapy was given concurrently with radiotherapy. All patients underwent a total mesorectal excision either by anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection. 54 patients (18.62%) achieved ypCR and 166 patients (57.24%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. The median follow up duration was 2.06 years and the overall recurrence rate was 33.2% at 5 years. The estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 77.0%. ypCR was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (SHR 0.294, CI 0.10-0.83, p = 0.020) and death (HR 0.195, CI 0.07-0.54, p = 0.002). Lymphovascular space invasion was associated with a higher risk of recurrence (HR 1.97, CI 1.12-3.47, p = 0.012). Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a higher survival rate (HR 0.537, CI 0.33-0.88, p = 0.013).\n\nConclusion:\nPatients with LARC who received NACRT and achieved ypCR were less likely to have recurrence and also had a better survival. Therefore, efforts should be made to maximize pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy. In this study, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival. Further analysis is required to determine if the subgroup of patients who achieved ypCR derive any survival benefit from AC or if chemotherapy could be safely omitted for them.\n","topics":";Topics;;;Gastrointestinal Cancers;;Colon and Rectal Cancer;;","citation":" Citation  Annals of Oncology (2017) 28 (suppl_3): iii13-iii136. /10.1093/annonc/mdx261.362 ","session":" Session  ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2017 ","date":" Date  28 June 2017 ","title":"Prognostic markers of tumour recurrence and survival of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and...","event":" Event  ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2017 "}

Recently, DNA methylation alterations have been shown to be a potential predictive biomarker for response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in solid tumors such as breast and rectal cancers.

In particular, TRAP1 is involved in control of several tumor cellular functions as intracellular signaling, cell cycle, apoptosis, stemness and bioenergetics through co-translational regulation of a network of client proteins (i.e., F1ATPase, TBP7, IF2α, EF1G, IF4A, IF4E, EF1A, BRAF, AKT, 18kDa Sorcin, CDK1/2, MAD2, βCatenin).

We therefore sought to study the association of lymphopenia and overall survival in esophageal cancer patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemo-radiation according to Dutch CROSS trial regime. One of the possible mechanism of severe lymphopenia in radiotherapy is the large volume of low dose bath killing large number of circulating lymphocytes in both systemic and pulmonary circulation.

The aim of our study was to show that metabolomic technology can be successfully used to distinguish persons with advanced adenomatous polyps from those without adenomas and the use of the technology could be further used for separation of patients with advanced adenomas from patients with non-advanced adenomas with potential to sub-categorization patients according to their pathological severity.\n","topics":";Topics;;;Gastrointestinal Cancers;;Colon and Rectal Cancer;;","citation":" Citation  Annals of Oncology (2017) 28 (suppl_3): iii13-iii136. 10.1093/annonc/mdx261 ","session":" Session  ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2017 ","date":" Date  28 June 2017 ","title":"Metabolomics-based test accurately detects and differentiates adenomatous polyps from human sera","event":" Event  ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2017 "}

Several mechanisms are known to explain sarcopenia (inflammation, neurodegenerative process, hormonal disorders, lack of exercise, malnutrition). While there is a high prevalence in the elderly, it can also develop in younger adults, especially in advanced cancer. Gradual loss of muscle mass during cancer treatment occurs in more than half of the patients. Multiple studies demonstrated patients with sarcopenia to be more prone to toxic effects of chemotherapy, cancer related fatigue and/or nosocomial infections, leading to dose reductions or treatment delays, which potentially reduce treatment efficacy and is associated with worse outcome and mortality.\nrn\nThis study will investigate whether sarcopenia is predictive for a worse progression free survival and increased treatment related toxicity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\n","topics":";Topics;;;Gastrointestinal Cancers;;Colon and Rectal Cancer;;Immunotherapy;;Therapy;;","citation":" Citation  Annals of Oncology (2017) 28 (suppl_3): iii13-iii136. 10.1093/annonc/mdx261 ","session":" Session  ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2017 ","date":" Date  28 June 2017 ","title":"A multicenter non-interventional study exploring the impact of sarcopenia on the outcomes of colorectal cancer patients treated with chemotherapy p...","event":" Event  ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2017 "}

Napabucasin is a first-in-class cancer stemness inhibitor in development identified by its ability to inhibit STAT3-driven gene transcription and spherogenesis of cancer stem cells (Li et al, PNAS 112(6):1839, 2015). Preclinically, napabucasin sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutics, including 5-FU and irinotecan. Encouraging anticancer activity in advanced CRC was observed in a phase Ib/II (Bendell et al, GI ASCO 2017) study of 63 pts with disease control rate (DCR) of 93% (28/30) and overall response rate (ORR) of 33% (10/30) in FOLFIRI-naïve pts who have had an on-study RECIST evaluation. On the basis of these data, a phase III trial is being conducted in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.\n\nTrial Design:\nThis study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02753127) will assess the efficacy of napabucasin+FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI in pts with mCRC (n = 1250). Addition of bevacizumab (bev) is permissible per investigator choice. Pts must have failed 1 prior line of therapy with oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine +/- bev for metastatic disease. Pts are randomized 1:1 to receive napabucasin 240 mg PO BID plus FOLFIRI bi-weekly, or FOLFIRI bi-weekly (bev may be added to FOLFIRI by investigator choice) and stratified by geography, time to progression on 1st-line therapy, RAS mutation status, bev as part of study treatment and primary tumor location. Treatment will continue until disease progression, or another discontinuation criterion. Primary endpoint is overall survival (OS) in the general study population (ITT) (HR 0.80 for OS improvement from 12.54 to 15.68 months); secondary endpoints include OS in the biomarker positive (biomarker+) population, progression free survival (PFS) in the ITT population, PFS in biomarker+ population, ORR and DCR in the ITT and in biomarker+ populations, safety and quality of life. Also, blood and tumor archival tissue will be assessed for PK and biomarker analyses.
