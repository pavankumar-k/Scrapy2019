The virus-host balance is mainly sustained by T-cell responses, which are able to control the infection asymptomatically. However, when T-cell immune control fails, EBV is associated with a number of human malignancies such as Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Existing vaccine strategies against EBV have not proven to be sufficient to combat EBV-associated tumors.", "keywords": ""}

If similar deviations in the rejection capacity of TILs can be identified across different tumor entities, this would open the way for anti-tumor immunotherapy. Functional non-responsiveness can be mediated through multiple non-exclusive mechanisms including exhaustion, tolerance, anergy or cellular inhibition. We have previously described that CD8+ TILs of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) show an anergic phenotype with high levels of diacylglycerol kinase-\u03b1 (DGK-\u03b1) and low levels of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation associated with lack of cytotoxic function and inability to respond to CD3 stimulation [1].The goal of this project is to analyze the immune infiltrate in ccRCC and non-virus associated hepatocellular carcinoma (nv-HCC) patients.", "keywords": ""}
