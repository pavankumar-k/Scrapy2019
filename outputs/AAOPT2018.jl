IPE is a vitally important and contemporary issue for schools and colleges of optometry. In this symposium, members of the 2017 – 2018 Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice Committee of the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry will share their strategies, experiences, and recommendations for effectively incorporating interprofessional education into optometric curricula.

However, not all cases of RNFL loss can be attributed to glaucoma, with diagnosis and management requiring careful consideration of different aspects of the clinical examination. Clinical data obtained using routine testing and through advanced imaging techniques can provide valuable clues to distinguish between glaucoma and other causes of RNFL loss. This important distinction may prevent unnecessary anti-glaucoma therapy or a delay of a more sinister diagnosis. We illustrate cases where RNFL loss was not attributable to glaucoma with significant implications on patient management and outcome.","title":"Rapid Fire When RNFL Loss is Not Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        58299-PS\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Michael Yapp, Jack Phu, Angelica Ly\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of New South Wales, Australia, Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia, Centre for Eye Health\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Stars at Night B4\n                    \n            |#|"}

Various contact lenses will be discussed, as well as different types of fitting philosophies and when it is appropriate to fit.","title":"Magnify Your Knowledge Contact Lenses For Your Low Vision Patients","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        58286-LV\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Erin Kenny\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 302\n                    \n            |#|"}

The low vision provider may encounter patients with non-organic vision loss and may be the first to determine that the visual disturbance is indeed non-organic. This course is designed to provide the low vision provider with the knowledge and skills necessary to better determine if the visual disturbance is indeed non-organic, whether it is deliberate or psychogenic and how each type can be appropriately managed.","title":"How to Evaluate and Manage the Patient with Nonorganic Vision Loss","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        57839-LV\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        South Texas Veterans Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 302\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, its exact impact on glaucoma remains a mystery. Our glaucoma management often relies on only one IOP measurement every few months which is likely insufficient to fully understand the nyctohemeral impact of IOP on the optic nerve. Recent literature has shed light on the importance of two other 'pressures' that might be of equal importance in glaucoma management. This Rapid Fire format course will highlight the proposed roles of 24 hour IOP, ocular perfusion pressure and cerebrospinal fluid pressure with a focus on their clinical relevance in glaucoma management.","title":"Rapid Fire Understanding IOP Perfusion Pressure and Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure in Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        57662-GL\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VAMC Memphis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Austin Lifferth, Sarah MacIver, Denise Pensyl\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Grossnickle Eye Centers, University of Waterloo Sch. of Optometry, Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hemisfair Ballroom C1\n                    \n            |#|"}

As ophthalmic technology advances, eye care providers will be able to diagnose glaucoma earlier than ever, which means patients are likely to be younger, healthier, and more averse to starting IOP-lowering medication for the rest of their lives. As such, lifestyle modifications that can reduce IOP represent an exciting area in eye care. This presentation will review the many lifestyle factors known to influence IOP.","title":"Lifestyle Modification for Prevention  Management of Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        57661-GL\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hemisfair Ballroom C1\n                    \n            |#|"}

Patient behavior can be helpful or exacerbating in managing these diseases.  Modifiable behaviors such as medication adherence, diet, exercise and smoking often do more to determine the course of the disease than anything the doctor can provide.  Although we try to educate, cajole, or scare our patients they often inexplicably continue the unhealthy behaviors that continue their decline.  In this course we look at strategies to improve outcomes in these patients using evidence-based behavior modification techniques that can be accomplished quickly during your routine exam.","title":"Behavior Change in Chronic Disease Management","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        57788-GO\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Lectures & Workshops\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Diana Dolan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 207\n                    \n            |#|"}

Research suggests that presbyopes are as motivated as non-presbyopes to maintain contact lens wear if their vision and comfort needs can be met. While contact lens discomfort continues to be the leading cause of overall contact lens dropout, in presbyopic wearers, quality of vision is equally responsible for dissatisfaction and discontinuation.

{"_type":"dict","author":"Diane Sayah","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/validation-of-a-clinical-technique-to-measure-ocular-rigidity","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Ocular rigidity (OR) is thought to play a key role in the pathophysiology of ocular\ndiseases, particularly open-angle glaucoma. While no reliable non-invasive method\nis currently available to measure OR, our group has recently developed an OCT-based\nmethod to measure OR in living human eyes. The purpose of the current study is to\nexplore ways to fine-tune our technique based on a comparison of results obtained\nwith invasive OR measurements.\nMethods: OR was measured in subjects with pre-existing retinal condition requiring intravitreal\ninjections (IVIs) of Bevacizumab, using two different techniques. Based on Friedenwald's\nequation, our novel imaging technique described in Beaton et al. (2015) involves the\nautomated segmentation of an 8mm wide B-scan movie of the choroid to estimate the\npulsatile ocular volume change (POVC), as well as dynamic contour tonometry to measure\nthe pulsatile IOP change. Using a two-sphere mathematical model of the eye with first-order\napproximation, the choroidal thickness (CT) change at the macula is used to estimate\nthe total POVC. The second technique involves IVIs of 50 µl of Bevacizumab and pre-\nand post-IVI IOP measurements.\nComparison of both OR values for a same eye was\ncarried out using SPSS, and different factors were considered to explain the differences\nbetween the obtained OR values.\nResults: A simple regression line was calculated to predict the OR coefficient obtained using\nthe invasive procedure based on the coefficient from the non-invasive method. A significant\nregression equation was found (F(1, 8) = 53.537, p<0.001) with an R\n2\nof 0.87. The OR coefficient obtained using our non-invasive technique (OR-OCT) is\n0.034±0.018/µl, whereas the OR measured using the invasive procedure (OR-IVI) is 0.014±0.007/µl,\nindicating 0.367 times lower OR coefficients with the latter.\nWe considered that\nour method for extrapolating the total POVC from the CT change under the macula could\nbe oversimplified since we might not appropriately consider the choroidal shape in\nthe periphery of the eye. We also eliminated reflux as a main contributor to the difference\nbetween the two techniques, as the average reflux volume would have been too large,\n27.1 ± 6.9 µl according to our calculations, and unlikely according to the literature\nand clinical observation.\nConclusion: In this study, we show that OR values are strongly correlated between our non-invasive\nmethod and the invasive procedure, but yield consistently higher values with our OCT-based\nmethod compared to the procedure involving IVIs. With the emergence of wide-field\nOCT, considerations of the shape of the choroid in the periphery of the eye will be\nuseful in improving the extrapolation of the POVC from the submacular CT change, rather\nthan simply adjusting for reflux from the IVI.\nOur novel method will permit further\ninvestigation of the role of OR in the pathogenesis of diseases such as glaucoma by\npermitting OR measurements in a large cohort.","title":"Validation of a Clinical Technique to Measure Ocular Rigidity","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185407\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Javier Mazzaferri, Renaud Duval, Flavio Rezende, Santiago Costantino, Mark Lesk\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, University of Montreal, University of Montreal, University of Montreal, University of Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Hin Cheung","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/reducing-testretest-variability-in-damaged-nasal-visual-fields","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Test-retest (T-RT) variability in visual field (VF) testing is known to increase with\ndepth of glaucomatous defect using size III and size V stimuli as demonstrated by\nArtes et al. 2015. This makes it more difficult for clinicians to discern whether\ntrue progression has occurred. Glaucomatous changes are frequently detected in the\nnasal VF, commonly referred to as a nasal step. We attempted to reduce T-RT variability\nin the nasal VF of glaucoma patients with existing nasal steps, by using large stimuli\nthat are resistant to both defocus and changes in illuminance and by restricting the\nrange of contrast.\nMethods: The nasal VF of control subjects and glaucoma patients with existing nasal steps were\ntested using two perimetric stimuli; a size V stimulus and a hard-edged 0.5 cycle/degree\nsinusoidal grating with a temporal presentation of 5 Hz counterphase flicker stimulus.\nThe stimuli were presented at 18 locations from the 24-2 locations in the nasal VF.\nIn 2015, 21 patients and 18 controls were tested with three monthly visits. To counteract\nthe effects of fatigue and learning, the order of testing was counter-balanced and\nonly the last two tests were used for analysis. In 2017, 13 patients and 15 controls\nreturned for two follow-up visits up to a month apart. The relation between T-RT variability\nand depth of defect was assessed using linear regression on Bland-Altman plots, and\nan effect size was calculated.\nResults: T-RT variability between areas of higher and lower sensitivities was not found to\nbe clinically significant, accounting for less than 3% of variance in all four Bland-Altman\ncomparisons in patients. In 2015, the median T-RT variability for patients was 0.17\nlog units for size V and 0.18 log units for the flicker stimulus, with interquartile\nrange of 0.15-0.20 and 0.14-0.24 respectively. In controls, the median T-RT variability\nwas 0.15 log units for both size V and the flicker stimulus, with interquartile range\nof 0.13-0.18 and 0.14-0.16 respectively. In 2017, the median T-RT variability for\npatients was 0.17 log units for size V and 0.16 log units for the flicker stimulus,\nwith interquartile range of 0.13-0.22 and 0.14-0.18 respectively. In controls, the\nmedian T-RT variability was 0.15 log units for size V and 0.16 log units for the flicker\nstimulus, with the same interquartile range of 0.15-0.17.\nConclusion: We successfully reduced the T-RT variability in damaged nasal VFs of glaucoma patients\ncomparable to the T-RT variability of Matrix perimetry reported by Artes et al. in\n2005. Both groups showed low T-RT variability with both stimuli and across multiple\nvisits. We found that large stimuli with a restricted range of contrast may be useful\nin longitudinal assessments of progression in damaged visual fields as previously\ndiscussed by Gardiner et al. 2016.","title":"Reducing TestRetest Variability in Damaged Nasal Visual Fields","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185408\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        William Swanson, Brett King\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Rarely, LAZ may be associated with\ngene mutation (C1QTNF5) causing late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD), but another\nidiopathic LAZ variety, possibly with >2% prevalence, has association with intraocular\npressure and is being investigated as a risk factor for glaucoma. Due to suspicion\nthat the idiopathic LAZ variety may result from an alternative gene mutation, could\nhave expression related to environmental influences, and could have association with\ncertain health conditions, we have studied the confluence of health problems and lifestyle\nfactors among subjects with LAZ.\nMethods: Patients presenting for routine eye care to multiple practitioners at an urban, academic\neye care facility in Chicago, IL, USA were examined for LAZ, and data was collected\nrelative to systemic/ocular health, demographic, and lifestyle variables via record\nreview and supplemental questionnaire. Due to collinearity between independent variables,\nan index score of coexisting factors was used for multivariate regression to assess\nLAZ relationships.\nResults: There were 3,303 total subjects (64.8% female, 82.5% African-American, mean age=50.7\n+/- 15.4 yrs, 18-94 yrs), including 126 subjects with LAZ (80.0% female, 94.2% African-American,\nmean age=60.2 +/- 11.7 yrs, 35-92 yrs). Factors contributing to the health index score\nincluded diabetes, hypertension, use of cholesterol medication, lung disease, heart\ndisease, history of cancer, BMI, smoking, and alcohol use. Final models showed that,\nwhile controlling for age (P<0.0001) and gender (P<0.001), the likelihood of\nhaving LAZ increased by 1.2x (OR=1.2, 95% CI=1.1 to 1.3, P=0.002) with each additional\nhealth factor, and likelihood of LAZ was 1.7x greater (OR=1.7, 95%CI=1.2 to 2.4) when\nfour or more factors were present.\nConclusion: People with the LAZ trait may be more likely to have numerous coexisting health problems\nand health risk factors than people without the trait. Further study is warranted\nto understand the pathophysiology of the idiopathic LAZ trait and why it may have\nrelationship to health status, intraocular pressure, and potentially glaucoma.","title":"Presence of the Idiopathic Long Anterior Zonule Trait and Likelihood of Having Numerous  Coexisting Health Conditions and Negative Lifestyle Factors","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185409\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Janice McMahon, Christina Morettin, Tricia Newman, Mary Roberts, Bruce Teitelbaum, Janis Winters\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this\nstudy was to examine how foveal pit dimensions compare in the fellow eyes of subjects\nwhose refractions cover a wide range.\nMethods: Axial lengths and macular thickness were obtained on both eyes of 25 subjects (average\nage 24.8 years) with refractions ranging from plano to -9.90 D. Axial lengths were\nmeasured with a Zeiss IOL Master and retinal thickness was measured with an Optovue\nRTVue spectral domain OCT using the MM6 scan pattern. Retinal thickness results were\nanalyzed using a custom Matlab program that computed the following parameters for\neach of the 12 scan orientations: maximum thickness on either side of the foveal pit,\nminimum thickness, pit depth, pit width at the maximum thickness (FWFM) and pit width\nat half the pit depth (FWHM). Lateral dimensions were corrected for the variation\nin transverse magnification of the OCT scan against axial length. Results were averaged\nfor all 12 scan orientations.\nResults: The average refraction for OD and OS eyes, respectively, was -3.68 D and -3.72 D and\nthe largest interocular difference in refraction was 1.50 D. The average axial length\nfor OD and OS eyes, respectively, was 24.66 mm and 24.63 mm; the largest interocular\ndifference in axial length was 0.65 mm. Refraction was strongly correlated with axial\nlength (p<0.001). Average foveal dimensions in the OD and OS eyes, respectively,\nwere: pit depth, 132.05 and 131.77 micron; minimum thickness, 210.37 and 210.77 micron;\nFWFM, 2234.23 and 2242.52 micron; FWHM, 857.14 and 843.72 micron. All foveal dimensions\nwere strongly correlated in fellow eyes (p<0.001 by linear regression).\nConclusion: In subjects with anisometropia less than 1.50 D, the foveal pit dimensions were very\nsimilar in fellow eyes over a range of refractions from emmetropia to high myopia.","title":"Comparison of Foveal Pit Dimensions in Fellow Eyes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185398\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry, MCPHS University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

It is a condition most\ncommonly associated with other ocular conditions, such as aniridia, nystagmus, albinism,\nmicrophthalmus, achromatopsia, and retinopathy of prematurity. With only a few reported\ncases, the incidence of isolated foveal hypoplasia is quite rare. While optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) has been identified as a useful tool in the diagnosis, OCT angiography\n(OCT-A) can be utilized to verify the absence of a foveal avascular zone.\n\nCase Report: A 44 year-old Hispanic male presented with a complaint of gradual decreased vision\nat both distance and near, with the reading-range being especially difficult. The\npatient denied any history of color vision discrimination or known childhood vision\nissues, although this was his first eye exam. His medical history was consistent with\nuncontrolled hypertension.\nA mild hyperopic correction of +1.50 DS OD and +1.25DS\nOS resulted in best corrected visual acuities of 20/30 OD, OS with no improvement\nwith pinhole. Upon gross medical observation, both eyes appeared to be of equal, normal\nsize without the presence of nystagmus or other physical alterations. Biomicroscopy\nnoted normal anterior segment anatomy in both eyes, including uniformly pigmented\nbrown irides. Pupils were equally sized and reactive with no relative afferent pupil\ndefect. Confrontation fields were full to finger counting in all quadrants of both\neyes. A dilated fundus examination revealed bilateral mild pigment mottling and the\nabsence of foveal reflexes. Small vessels also appeared to be extending into the presumed\navascular foveal area. No other abnormal findings were noted, including well-perfused\noptic nerves with .3/.3 cup-to-disc ratios and normal peripheral retinal structures.\nA\nmacular OCT confirmed the absence of a foveal depression and intact, continuous inner\nretinal layers overlying the presumed foveal area in both eyes. OCT-A also confirmed\nthe lack of a foveal avascular zone with uniform blood flow reflectance throughout\nboth maculae.\nBased on the Thomas et al. grading system, the foveal hypoplasia\nwas classified as grade 3 due to the absence of the extrusion of plexiform layers,\nformation of the foveal pit and lengthening of the outer segments of the photoreceptors\nwhile involving a widened outer nuclear layer. After the patient was educated about\nthe nature of his vision loss and stable prognosis, yearly monitoring was initiated.\nConclusion: While isolated foveal hypoplasia is a rare condition, the utilization of OCT confirmed\nthe lack of a foveal depression with continuous inner retinal layer architecture.\nHowever with the conjunction of OCT-A technology, the lack of a foveal avascular zone\nwas also proven to be present in this condition without the invasive nature of fluorescein\nangiography or the potentially lethal side effects.","title":"An Isolated Case of Foveal Hypoplasia Demonstrated via OCTA","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185399\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

In previous cross-sectional\nstudies of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in patients with\nRP, the macular ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer (GCL+IPL) thickness\nwas significantly reduced in eyes with greater loss of photoreceptors, visual acuity\n(VA) or contrast sensitivity (CS). Inner retinal thickening has been associated with\nincreased aqueous flare in RP, suggesting the involvement of intraocular inflammation\nin the disease process. Inner retinal changes may represent distinct stages of retinal\nremodeling that occur before, during, or after photoreceptor and visual function loss,\nwhich we explored in a longitudinal case study.\nMethods: A 49 year old white female with a confirmed x-linked RP mutation in the ORF15 region\nof the RPGR gene completed ETDRS VA, Pelli-Robson CS and Goldmann visual field (GVF)\nrepeated testing at nine visits in 2012, 2013 and 2018. Heidelberg Spectralis SD-OCT\nwas obtained at seven visits in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Retinal layer thickness\nwas calculated in the ETDRS subfields for each of the segmented inner retina layers:\nretinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), GCL+IPL, and inner nuclear layer (INL). Longitudinal\nretinal thickness changes were considered significant if they exceeded within-visit\ntest-retest variability determined in a cohort of seven other RP patients and/or were\nconfirmed with linear regression analysis.\nResults: VA of 0.27 logMAR was stable throughout the six-year period, but CS declined by 0.30\nlogCS, which corresponded to a significant reduction in central total retinal thickness\nin 2017 mediated by losses in the RNFL, GCL+IPL, and INL. The patient self-reported\na new scotoma located nasal to fixation in 2016, which was confirmed with GVF testing\nin 2018 as an absolute scotoma in a region with previous sensitivity to the III4e\ntest target in 2012-2013. Significantly decreased RNFL thickness (-11% to -24%; p=0.008)\nand increased GCL+IPL thickness (5% to 13%) occurred in the parafoveal temporal retinal\narea during the time immediately preceding the patient's observation of the paracentral\nscotoma.\nConclusion: Longitudinally documented loss of CS and parafoveal visual field corresponded to significant\nchanges in inner retinal thickness in a female x-linked RP patient.","title":"Longitudinal Changes in Visual Function and Retinal Thickness in a Female Patient  with XLinked Retinitis Pigmentosa","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185400\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ava Bittner, Aaron Carass, Yufan He, Jerry Prince\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        NOVA Southeastern University College of Optometry, Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of P..., Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of P..., Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of P...\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Her mother denied other academic difficulties.\nShe had had an eye exam 2 years prior at an optical, where glasses were prescribed,\nbut a dilated fundus examination was not completed. Birth and development was normal,\nand medical history was unremarkable. There was no known family history of any ocular\nconditions. External testing was unremarkable, and there was no sign of nystagmus.\nThe patient appreciated 100\" local stereopsis with Wirt circles, but no global stereopsis.\nBest corrected visual acuity after cycloplegic refraction was 20/40 in each eye. Cycloplegic\nrefractive error was not amblyogenic: compound hyperopic astigmatism in the right\neye (+1.50-1.00x010) and simple hyperopic astigmatism in the left eye (+0.75-0.75x180).\nAnterior segment health was unremarkable; there were no iris transillumination defects.\nPosterior ocular health assessment was unremarkable; it was not noted if a foveal\nreflex was present. A glasses prescription was given for full time wear and the patient\nwas instructed to return in two months for follow up. The patient was lost to follow\nup until six months later. At this visit, when the author first met the patient (now\n8 years old), vision in the new glasses was stable at 20/40 in each eye, and stereopsis\nremained reduced at 100\" Wirt circles and no RDS. Upon dilated fundus examination,\nthere were no foveal landmarks present and there was no foveal reflex. A macular OCT\nscan was obtained, which revealed no foveal depression in either eye. There was outer\nnuclear layer lengthening in the presumed macular area, corresponding to grade 3 foveal\nhypoplasia (Thomas et al 2011). A diagnosis of isolated foveal hypoplasia was given,\nand the patient's mother was educated on the poor prognosis of visual improvement\ndue to an anatomical abnormality. She was asked to return in 6 months to repeat a\ndilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography, and for fundus autofluorescence.\nShe was lost to follow up again and has presently not returned to the clinic.\nConclusion: Isolated foveal hypoplasia without nystagmus and low vision is rare in the literature,\nbut it may present in the primary eye care setting. Macular OCT and fundus autofluorescence\nshould be performed to confirm foveal hypoplasia. Genetic testing should also be ordered\nto rule out ocular albinism and other conditions associated with foveal hypoplasia.","title":"Bilateral Isolated Foveal Hypoplasia Without Nystagmus in a Child A Case Report","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185401\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The light reflected from the retina is collected and analyzed by a\nspectrometer. The instrument software calculates MPOD by averaging the spectrometer\nsignals obtained after eliminating first and last 10 seconds of the data and accounts\nfor individual lens optical density and age-related changes in lens.\nFifty individuals\nwith visual acuity of 20/20 or better in both eyes and free from ocular pathology\nwere examined for the purposes of the study. The mean age of the study participants\nwas 28.5 years (SD 8.0 years). The MPOD measurements were performed objectively using\nthe MPR device (ZeaVision St-Louis MO, USA; figure 1) by two non-clinicians that were\ntrained for the study purposes. A total of 8 measurements were performed on everyone.\nObserver-1 performed measurements twice in the selected eye and once in the fellow\neye both without and with pupillary dilation. The Observer-2 performed measurement\nonly on the fellow eye both without and with pupillary dilation.\nThe difference\nin the mean MPR-MPOD between first and second measurements and between investigators\nwere evaluated using the paired samples t-test. The Altman and Bland analysis was\nperformed to evaluate the intra and inter observer agreement of the measured MPOD\nunder both undilated and dilated conditions.\nResults: The Table 1 provides the mean MPOD measured by both observers without and with pupillary\ndilation. The mean MPOD measured by observer 1 without pupillary dilation and with\npupillary dilation was not significantly different compared to repeat measurements\nmade by the same observer or when compared to measurements made by observer 2 (paired\nsamples t-test p=0.6, 0.06,0.65 and 0.39 respectively).

The patient's medical history was non-contributory with no\nprior eye examinations to date.\nBest-corrected visual acuities with a mild\nanisometropic refraction improved vision to 20/30 OD, 20/25 OS but with eccentric\nviewing-like techniques. Biomicroscopic evaluation of the anterior segment was unremarkable.\nDilated fundus evaluation revealed bilateral symmetric areas of geographic retinal\nand choroidal atrophy encompassing both the macula and optic nerve. No significant\ndrusenoid changes were noted centrally and only scattered peripheral perivascular\npigmentary changes were observed. Optic nerve evaluation showed healthy perfusion\nwith no notable cupping.\nFundus autofluorescence showed a large geographic\narea of hypoautofluorescence involving the macula with multiple islands of peripapillary\nand mid-peripheral hypoautofluorescence with no significant halos noted. With spectral-domain\nocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT), there was parafoveal photoreceptor and RPE atrophy\nwith choroidal enhancement. Inner retinal layers remain intact with outer retinal\nthinning. A very small central island of the photoreceptor integrity line (PIL) and\nRPE are preserved consistent with central acuities. Using OCT-angiography (OCT-A),\na more recent imaging technique analyzing retinal and choroidal blood flow, the patient\nshows relatively normal inner retinal blood flow and vasculature with significant\nislands of fine choriocapillary vessel dropout.\nConclusion: Rare and poorly characterized over the years, choroidal dystrophies, such as PPCCD\nand its ilk, have been historically diagnosed by funduscopic evaluation and more invasive\nfluorescein angiography. With the advancements in noninvasive imaging techniques like\nfundus autofluorescence, SD-OCT, and the newer OCT angiography, this case hopes to\nshow some of the more defining features of this uncommon condition. To date, there\nis little data supporting any inheritance pattern or significant demographic preference.\nDiagnosis will still rely largely upon direct evaluation, but with newer imaging technologies,\nclinicians can better evaluate the rate of progression and extent of damage to help\neducate patients on their unique visual prognosis and formulate plans to suit the\npatient's lifestyle needs.","title":"MultiModal Imaging of Posterior Polar Central Choroidal Dystrophy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185403\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Vladislav Koyfman, Zanna Kruoch, Andrew Kemp, Marcus Gonzales\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study was therefore designed to prospectively explore change in\nMOPP when body position is converted from an upright position to an inverted, head-down\n(Trendelenburg) position and to investigate factors related to this positional change.\nMethods: The research cohort consisted of attendees at the American Academy of Optometry meeting\nin Chicago 2017 who volunteered to participate at the Exhibit Hall Inversion Booth\nproject sponsored by the Fellows Doing Research SIG and the Glaucoma Section. The\nstudy was approved by the Investigational Review Board of the Illinois College of\nOptometry, and all subjects provided informed consent. Baseline measurements, with\nall subjects in the upright position, were obtained for pulse, blood pressure (BP),\nand intraocular pressure (IOP). These measurements were then repeated at 1-2 minutes\nand 2-4 minutes after assuming a 30-degree, head-down Trendelenburg position. Calculation\nof MOPP was accomplished for each timepoint using a published algorithm. Statistical\nanalysis included pair-wise comparisons and regression analyses, and central tendency\ndata was presented as median (inter-quartile range [IQR]).\nResults: Our sample included 99 men (43%) and 131 women (57%); median (IQR) age was 31 (26,48)\nyears and most subjects were either Caucasian (70.9%) or Asian (22.6%). MOPP decreased\nby 25% (16,35) from baseline to inversion time 1, but only changed 2% (-5,7) from\ninversion time 1 to inversion time 2. This corresponded with MOPP values (mm Hg) of\n50.3 (43.4, 55.4), 36.3 (31.9,43.3), and 35.7 (31.1, 42.1) at baseline, inversion\ntime 1, and inversion time 2 respectively. In regression analyses using demographic\nand baseline clinical variables, weight was the only variable independently related\nto percent MOPP change from baseline to inversion time 1 (r2=0.05, p=0.008). When\nincluding variables related to change in IOP and BP from baseline to inversion time\n1, percent MOPP change was independently related to increasing IOP, decreasing systolic\nBP, and decreasing diastolic BP (total r2=0.74, p<0.001).\nConclusion: In our young, healthy, and relatively large sample, MOPP decreased by 25% from an\nupright position to a 30-degree Trendelenburg (inverted, head-down) position. The\nmagnitude of MOPP reduction upon inversion was largely determined by degree of IOP\nincrease and diastolic BP decrease. These results may aid future investigations of\nMOPP, particularly those that target populations at higher-risk for MOPP-related ocular\ncompromise.","title":"Change in Mean Ocular Perfusion Pressure from Upright to Trendelenburg Position","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185404\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Northwest Eye Surgeons\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Rex Ballinger, Michael Sullivan-Mee, Lauren Ristin, Andrew Rixon, Sarah Wood\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Baltimore VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VAMC Memphis, Kellogg Eye Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

The Institutional Review Board at\nthe Illinois College of Optometry approved the study and all subjects completed informed\nconsent prior to participating in any study procedures. After subjects completed an\nintake questionnaire (that included data for age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight,\nrefractive error, medication use, eye health, and systemic health information), each\nsubject underwent SD-OCT imaging of the right optic nerve, followed by intraocular\npressure and blood pressure measurements in upright and inverted positions. OCT Image\nquality was assessed by a panel of experts and included only if considered good quality\nby consensus.

Although RA was significantly\nrelated to both RNFL and VCD, RNFL and VCD were not significantly related. In univariate\nregression analyses, optic disc area was directly related to RNFL, RA, and VCD whereby\nage was directly related to VCD but inversely related to RNFL and RA.

A glaucoma specialist carried out gonioscopy and iridocorneal angles\nwere graded according to the Shaffer classification.

Furthermore, Tukey-Kramer\nHSD analysis was also carried out to evaluate the statistical differences between\nthe means of S-I, for each Shaffer grade.\nResults:\nResults: Thirty-four images from forty enrolled subjects were available for analysis.\nSchwalbe's line was identifiable in 94% of the total images. Correlation coefficients\nbetween S-I measurements and Shaffer grades were 0.81 and 0.77 for nasal and temporal\nquadrants respectively ( P < .05). Inter and intraobserver repeatability for measuring\nS-I each scored very well using a paired t-test. The means of S-I for gonioscopically\noccludable angles were statistically different than the means for gonioscopically\nwide-open angles as measured with a Tukey-Kramer HSD analysis. The diagnostic cutoff\nvalue of S-I for occludable angles was established at 300 microns.\nConclusion:\nConclusion: The measurement of S-I using anterior segment OCT imaging strongly correlates\nwith gonioscopy and may be a suitable non-invasive alternative for evaluating the\nrisk for angle closure.","title":"Predicting Primary Angle Closure Suspects using Anterior Segment OCT  A New Approach","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185406\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Montreal University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        SÃ©bastien GagnÃ©, Marie-Eve Corbeil, Pierre Forcier\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        CHUM Notre-Dame, Montreal University School of Optometry, Montreal University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Seeing colors was difficult too. She experienced daily ocular\nmigraines and saw wavy lines. Writing was difficult. They had gotten a new large screen\nTV (50 inches) and she could watch it from about 15 feet away. She was very light\nsensitive, especially with the migraines. Walking on uneven ground was difficult as\nwell as walking down steps. Her center vision was not good and she used her peripheral\nvision. She preferred her contacts as she had distortions with her glasses.\nHe\nhad difficulty seeing at distance, seeing faces, and quit driving 3 years before.\nHe was not interested in reading or TV and preferred to work outside. His wife had\nleft him and took their daughter because his progressive vision loss caused him to\nlose his job. When he gets tired his L upper lid droops and the eye turns out.

His best corrected distance visual acuities were 20/40 in the right\neye and 20/30 in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were 23mmHg in the right eye\nand 26mmHg in the left eye. Optic nerve head observations revealed markedly thin superior\nand inferior rim tissue with mild pallor. Spectral domain (SD)- optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) optic disc cube findings of both eyes showed significantly thinned\nsuperior and inferior retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) distribution consistent with\nthe optic nerve head appearance. The OCT macular cube scans showed a normal central\nsubfoveal thickness in both eyes. The high definition OCT raster scan of the left\nmacula (Figure 1) revealed small hyporeflective spaces nasal to the fovea within the\ninner nuclear layer (INL), which also lacked a hyper-reflective outer wall. The spaces\ndid not distend outside of the INL and did not cause changes to the morphology of\nthe other retinal layers. Ganglion cell analysis (GCA) showed thinned sectors consistent\nwith the RNFL. The patient was diagnosed with advanced glaucoma in both eyes with\nMME in the left eye.\nConclusion: Microcystic macular edema is an OCT finding of the macular region that is characterized\nby small hyporeflective vacuoles found within the INL of the perimacular region without\nextension to the adjacent layers. They are typically monocular, and have been correlated\nto more advanced stages of optic neuropathy such as in glaucoma or optic neuritis.\nOn OCT, these microcysts will correspond to an area of thickened INL. In contrast,\nthe ganglion cell layer (GCL) and RNFL will be thinner in those areas, making the\noverall macular thickness values appear to be within normal range. Their formation\nis hypothesized to be a consequence of neurosensory retinal thinning which subsequently\ncauses retinal stress. As a result, the MÃ¼ller cells' water regulatory system become\ndisrupted and secondary MÃ¼ller cell body drop out at the INL will form the small hyporeflective\nspaces. Distinguishing MME is crucial because they can be confused with other retinal\nfindings such as cystoid macular edema. Because the condition is a result of MÃ¼ller\ncell dysfunction, it will not respond to steroid or anti-vascular endothelial growth\nfactor injection. Therefore, correctly identifying the condition will prevent further\nunnecessary treatment.

It tends to be bilateral\nand relatively symmetric; however, unilateral cases have been reported. Since 1937,\napproximately 100 cases of PPCRA have been reported. Patients are typically asymptomatic\nor complain of mild blur. Primary PPCRA is speculated to be caused by autosomal dominant\nor X-linked inheritance, whereas secondary causes are most often inflammatory in nature.\n\nCase Report: An 83 year old Hispanic male complained of deteriorating clarity of vision, as well\nas vertical diplopia. He had a history of a congenital right superior oblique palsy,\ncorrected with prism, and a chorioretinitis with mild macular edema in both eyes (OU).\nHe also had a history of shingles, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and Bell's palsy.\nEntering corrected acuities were 20/60 OD and 20/30+2 OS. Cover test revealed a mild\nright hypertropia at distance and near. Pupils had sluggish response OU without an\nAPD. There was inferior constriction on confrontation fields OU. BCVAs after refraction\nwere 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS. Biomicroscopy revealed meibomitis OU, pingueculae OU,\npunctate keratitis OU, scattered iris atrophy OU, and PCIOL with open capsule OU.\nIn addition, there was an elevated yellow conjunctival lesion on the temporal bulbar\nconjunctiva OD. Intraocular pressures were 14 and 12 mmHg OD/OS. Dilated fundus examination\nrevealed 0.45 CD ratios and healthy-appearing nerves with circumpapillary extensions\nof chorioretinal atrophy OU, as well as parafoveal drusen and RPE pigment clumping\nin the maculae. Peripheral retina examination showed pigment clumping extending out\nalong the retinal veins with corresponding adjacent retinal atrophy OD>OS. Color\nand fundus autofluorescence photos highlighted the paravenous pigment clumping and\nchorioretinal atrophy. Humphrey 120-point visual fields showed significant diffuse\nconstriction OU. Dark adaptometry showed a significant decrease in rod and cone sensitivity.\nFull-field ERG showed borderline-decreased scoptopic responses. Photopic (cone) single\nflash and 30 Hz flicker ERGs were significantly decreased OD>OS. Multifocal ERG\n(mfERG) showed significantly decreased amplitudes with delayed latencies OD>OS.\nConclusion: The perimetry, dark adaptation, ERG results are consistent with a diffuse adverse\neffect on retinal function, with greater decrease in cone function. PPCRA is a rare\ncondition that currently is not well understood or well classified. It appears to\nbe non-progressive. It is important to identify whether an eye with PPCRA has active\ninflammation. If not, observe closely to monitor for progression. The patient had\na confirmed abnormal quantiferon gold test and scarring on his chest x-ray. This supports\na diagnosis of secondary PPCRA.","title":"A Rare Retinal Finding Pigmented Paravenous Chorioretinal Atrophy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185388\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jeannette Wong-Powell, Jeff Rabin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word Rosenberg School of Optometry, UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The patient\nwas last seen in 2016 and referred for retinal consult however, he was non-compliant\nwith follow up. Systemic history was pertinent for hypertension. Blood pressure was\n140/80 mmHg RAS. BCVA was 20/20 OD and OS. Pertinent exam findings included collateral\nvessels of the optic nerve OS and improved CME of temporal macula. Repeat macular\nOCT demonstrated improved macular thickness with a decrease in central subfield thickness\nof 68um from macular OCT taken 2 years ago. OCT-A 6x6mm scan allowed novel visualization\nof abnormal telangiectasia of deep capillary plexus vessels of the temporal parafoveal\nzone that correlated with the temporal sensory retinal edema noted on traditional\nmacular OCT imaging. Retinal consult yielded confirmation of OCT-A findings with no\ntreatment indicated but rather, continued follow up.\nThe deep capillary plexus\nhas been shown to be more severely affected in retinal vein occlusions as compared\nto either superficial or choroidal plexuses. It has been postulated that this may\nbe due to the unique morphological capillary vortex arrangement of the deep plexus\nand its role in drainage of the superficial venules; thus, making it more susceptible\nto defect. Regardless, OCT-A provides a unique modality to image these microvascular\nchanges.\nConclusion: Secondary retinal telangiectasia is a potential complication of retinal vein occlusions\nand can result in persistent macular edema long after resolution of initial retinal\nfindings. OCT-angiography software allows for innovative imaging of various retinal\ncapillary plexuses and is useful in the management of these cases, allowing to rule\nout more ominous causes of defect. An astute clinician should utilize traditional\nand fresh OCT software methods to uncover previously unidentified sources of atypical\npresentations and to aid in management of these cases.","title":"Digging Deeper Use of OCTAngiography to Uncover and Visualize Abnormal Vasculature  in a Case of Persistent Macular Edema","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185389\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Raquel Antoine\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The most common clinical feature is retinal hemorrhage\ninvolving multiple layers. RAM is associated with hypertension and arteriosclerotic\ndisease and is more commonly found in elderly women. When a patient presents with\nmultiple RAM a differential that needs to be considered is Coats' disease. We present\nan atypical case with serial imaging that aided in the diagnosis of adult onset Coats'\ndisease.\n\nCase Report: A 59-year-old African American female presented with a central hazy cloud in her vision\nOD. She noted this after completing a marathon 6 days prior. Her best corrected visual\nacuities were 20/500 OD PHNI, 20/20 OS. Anterior segment was remarkable for trace\nnuclear sclerosis OU. Dilated fundus examination revealed 6 RAM, scattered dot/blot\nhemes, and mild exudation in the superior arcades to midperiphery OD and subretinal\nand preretinal hemorrhage in the macula OD. The dilated exam OS was unremarkable.\nAn OCTA revealed tortuosity of retinal capillaries OD. The patient's medical history\nwas positive for GERD. She had a recent vascular workup and MRI that were both unremarkable.\nHer blood pressure at the exam was 148/82 mmHg RAS. An extensive review of the patient's\nrecord revealed 3 years of serial imaging that included photos, OCT, and fluorescein\nangiography. Multiple past fluorescein angiographies revealed several RAM, large areas\nof capillary nonperfusion with adjacent larger webs of filigreelike capillaries, and\nmicroaneurysms OD and no abnormalities OS.

OCT cross section scans of the main\nlesion revealed findings consistent with CHRPE.\n2\nImage (E) shows alteration\nto the retinal pigment epithelium, increased light penetration into the choroid (consistent\nwith lacunae development in CHRPE), and loss of outer retinal layers within the lesion.\nOCT\nimaging adjacent to the CHRPE demonstrates findings that are consistent with dark\nwithout pressure.\n3\nThere is decreased reflectivity of the external limiting\nmembrane within the region as depicted by the extent of the yellow areas shown in\nImage (F). There is no elevation, or fluid seen throughout the lesion.\nThe\npatient was monitored in four months with repeat OCT imaging. All findings were stable.\nConclusion: This case report demonstrates infrared imaging, optical coherence tomography, optos\nfundus photography, and optos autofluorescent imaging of CHRPE with shadow sign in\na young, myopic, Caucasian male patient. This case is unique in that this is the first\ndocumented report of the finding in a Caucasian patient.","title":"Congenital Hypertrophy of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium with Shadow Sign in Young  Caucasian Male","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185393\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Charles Retina Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Stephanie Johnson, Mohammad Rafieetary\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Primary Eye Care of Arlington, Charles Retina Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This multifactorial condition\ndevelops in crowded optic discs after an obstruction of the short posterior ciliary\narteries supplying the anterior optic nerve, which results in painless, acute, monocular\nvision loss along with a 15% risk of involvement of the fellow eye within 5 years.\nVisual field loss, typically in an inferior altitudinal or arcuate fashion, is common\nand the visual prognosis is guarded. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A)\ncan be utilized in conjunction with structural OCT and visual fields (VF) in the workup\nand monitoring of NA-AION as it highlights variations in capillary perfusion and retinal\nvasculature appearance, which can be correlated with the special testing results.\nCorrelative data is useful as it cost-effectively assists in the differential diagnosis\nof ON edema, as well as understanding the underlying pathology and determining the\nprognosis.\n\nCase Report: A 57 yo Caucasian female presented with hazy vision inferiorly OD of one week duration.\nMedical history was negative but in-office blood pressure was 159/91. Acuities were\n20/20 OD/OS. Preliminary testing and slit lamp examination were unremarkable. Intraocular\npressures were 18 mmHg OD/OS. Dilated fundus examination (DFE) revealed an edematous\nON OD and a pink, healthy, distinct ON OS with a \"disc-at-risk\" appearance. VF had\nscattered depressed points with low reliability OD/OS. Structural OCT revealed markedly\nelevated RNFL and a classic \"lazy V\" pattern consistent with disc edema OD and normal\nRNFL OS. Using retinal segmentation, OCT-A portrayed a reduction of papillary vascular\nand capillary definition as well as reduced papillary capillary and vascular density\nOD, as compared to OS. Capillary perfusion of the superior retina was also reduced.\nEmergent lab work, MRI, MRV, and lumbar puncture were all negative and a diagnosis\nof NA-AION was made. At the two week follow-up, acuities were 20/20 OD/OS with an\nafferent pupillary defect OD. DFE, VF and structural OCT revealed reduced ON swelling,\nan inferior altitudinal defect, and reduced RNFL elevation, respectively. OCT-A displayed\nmore distinct capillary and vascular definition, increased papillary capillary density,\nand significantly more visible retinal vasculature at the center of the ON.

Optometric imaging techniques, such as optical coherence\ntomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and kinetic visual field testing,\nare very useful tools that can aid in differentiating and diagnosing rare retinal\nconditions. The purpose of this case report is to describe an atypical presentation\nof pigmented paravenous retinochoroidal atrophy (PPRCA) that was diagnosed through\nthe use of these optometric imaging techniques.\n\nCase Report: A 68-year-old male presented for a comprehensive eye exam complaining of constant\nmild blur that was worse in his right eye. He reported that 5 years ago he was diagnosed\nwith an unknown retinal condition and that he was currently concerned for his vision.\nHis best corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. A mild afferent pupillary\ndefect (APD) was present OD and fields were mildly constricted OD. On dilated fundus\nexamination of the right eye, extensive chorioretinal atrophy was observed along the\nmajority of the retinal blood vessels, beginning at the optic nerve and extending\nout into the periphery. The left eye revealed mild chorioretinal atrophy that was\nscattered along the blood vessels. Optometric imaging was completed to help rule out\ndifferential diagnoses. The imaging techniques included Spectralis OCT of the optic\nnerve and macula with an autofluorescence setting, OCT angiography (OCT-A), enhanced\ndepth imaging of the choroid utilizing Cirrus OCT, color and autofluorescence images\nwith Daytona Plus Optos, and Octopus V4e visual field testing. Based off the results\nfrom the comprehensive eye exam and the imaging, the patient was ultimately diagnosed\nwith PPRCA, a rare retinal condition of unknown etiology. The patient was educated\non the final diagnosis, including its longstanding nature and its stability. It is\nworth noting that the patient was greatly appreciative that his retinal finding had\na diagnosis and that his visual prognosis was good.\nConclusion: This case report describes a bilateral, but asymmetric, presentation of PPRCA.

On imaging, ORT is characterized\nas a hyper-reflective ovoid or circular band surrounding a hypo-reflective lumen at\nthe level of the outer nuclear layer. ORT is observed in multiple retinal conditions\nincluding macular degeneration, macular diseases and retinal dystrophies. In particular,\nORT is evident in both non-neovascular and neovascular age-related macular degeneration.\nRecognition of ORT is of clinical significance as the lesion may represent a biomarker\nfor disease progression. Although the exact pathogenesis of ORT remains elusive, the\nproposed mechanism suggests an active process toward photoreceptor survival by invagination\nof the photoreceptors and activation of MÃ¼ller cells. Recently, imaging findings have\nbeen correlated to histopathological characteristics leading to the proposed sequential\ndevelopment and progression of ORT lesions.

Proliferative disease tends to form at\nthe borders of ischemic and non-ischemic areas and favors the optic nerve head and\nthe major retinal vascular arcades. The foveal avascular zone is spared due to the\ndensely oxygenated underlying choriocapillaris, which maintains homeostasis under\nhypoxic conditions. We will present a case of foveal retinal neovascularization identified\non optical coherence tomography angiography.\n\nCase Report: A 71-year-old African American male with a 33-year-history of non-insulin dependent\ndiabetes presented for his annual diabetic eye exam. He reported longstanding visual\ndisturbances bilaterally which have escalated in the last few months. Best-corrected\nvisual acuity was 20/50 OD, OS. The patient was unaware of his BS or HbA1C readings.\nFundus examination revealed bilateral neovascularization of the disc with superior\nand inferior extension resulting in a tractional retinal detachment.

SD-OCT confirmed the presence of NVD, exudates and hemorrhages.\nOCTA delineated a region of foveal neovascularization characterized by the presence\nof fine microvascular loops originating in the juxtafoveal vascular plexus.\nConclusion: OCTA is a non-invasive imaging modality that allows for 3D visualization of the retinal\nand choroidal vasculature. Due to obscuration from leakage and poor lesion visualization\non fluorescein angiography, foveal retinal neovascularization has been a rarely reported\nfinding in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

The onset of these symptoms was sudden and started 1.5\nweeks before the visit. Entering visual acuity was 20/20- in each eyes, pupils were\nround, reactive to light, without a relative afferent pupil defect. Fundus examination\nof the right eye revealed dilated, mildly tortuous veins, and scattered intraretinal\nhemorrhages without macular edema; consistent with the diagnosis of a central retinal\nvein occlusion (CRVO). A large gray lesion was evident nasal to the fovea and a similar\nsmaller lesion temporal to the fovea. High definition optical coherence tomography\nscans (OCT) through the lesions showed hyper-reflectivity at the level of the inner\nnuclear layer (INL). After 2 months, the hyper-reflectivity resolved with resulting\nfocal INL atrophy. The area of atrophy was associated with capillary dropout in the\ndeep capillary plexus (DCP) imaged with OCT-angiography (OCTA). Humphrey visual field\nSITA Standard 10-2 showed a superior temporal defect that corresponded to the gray\nlesion noted clinically, as well as the paracentral INL thinning observed on OCT,\nand the capillary dropout on OCTA. The patient was diagnosed with paracentral acute\nmiddle maculopathy secondary to CRVO.\nConclusion: Paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) is a recently recognized OCT finding defined\nby a hyper-reflective lesion at the level of the INL. PAMM has been associated with\nconditions such as diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell anemia, hypertensive retinopathy,\nand migraines. It is hypothesized that PAMM is a result of ischemia to the DCP which\nsits at the outer edge of the INL. The DCP supplies oxygen to the outer plexiform\nlayer where the photoreceptor axonal terminals reside. The axonal terminals are filled\nwith mitochondria, making the oxygen demand at the OPL higher than any other region\nof the retina. Also, the oxygen levels vary through the retina; highest near the choroid,\nlowest level at the OPL and INL, increased towards the RNFL. Taken together, these\nlimitations place the mid-retinal region at the greatest risk for an ischemic insult,\nresulting in the hyper-reflectivity on OCT. In CRVO the thrombotic obstruction of\nthe central retinal vein results in an acute increase in the venous pressure, preventing\nblood from entering the retina. This results in ischemia and capillary closure, leading\nto PAMM.","title":"Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy Secondary to Central Retinal Vein Occlusion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185383\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lee Vien, David Yang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Macular choroidal thickness in the cooled eye increased\nsignificantly after 10 minutes (mean difference (post-pre) [95% CI] = +3.78 µm [+1.07\nto +6.89], t\n19\n= 2.42, p = .026), and rapidly diminished during the recovery,\nwith no change in the warmed eye (-1.65 µm [-3.63 to +0.49] t\n19\n= -1.56,\np = .135). There was a significant difference in changes of macular choroidal thickness\nbetween the cooled and the warmed eye (+5.43 µm [+1.93 to +8.92], t\n19\n=\n3.25, p = .004). The choroid also showed significant thickness increase in parafoveal\n(+7.03 µm [+1.65 to +12.41], p =.013) and perifoveal (+5.26 µm [+1.69 to +8.83], p=.006)\nregions in the cooled eye relative to the warmed eye. However, there were no changes\nin retinal thickness with either cooling (+0.00 µm [-0.638 to +0.639], t\n19\n= 0.001, p = .999) or warming (+0.38 µm [-0.65 to +1.42], t\n19\n= 0.77, p\n= .450) of the anterior eye.\nConclusion: Cooling the anterior eye caused a small but significant increase in choroidal thickness,\nwhereas warming the eye did not affect the thickness. The OCT measures of retinal\nthickness did not change with either cooling or warming, indicating that the choroidal\nthickness changes were not attributable to OCT artifacts potentially induced by temperature\nchanges. Our study findings suggest that the choroid modulates its thickness rapidly\nand transiently in response to local temperature changes, but the mechanism of these\nresponses remains to be investigated.","title":"The Effect of Temperature on the Thickness of the Ocular Choroid","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185384\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The University of Auckland\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kim Lucia, Philip Turnbull, John Phillips\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The University of Auckland, The University of Auckland, The University of Auckland\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

She had\nno specific visual or ocular complaints. She had recently started an intense six-week\nround of chemotherapy treatment of caboplatin and paciltaxel for endometrial cancer.\nAn otherwise healthy individual systemically, she presented with best-corrected visual\nacuity of 20/20 in the right (OD) and left eyes (OS). Pupils, eye movements and confrontational\nvisual fields were within normal limits OD, OS. Slit lamp biomicroscopy showed mild\nnuclear cataracts in both eyes. A dilated fundus exam was significant an epi-retinal\nmembrane (ERM) in the right eyes and a small area of elevation and RPE mottling inferior\nto the fovea in the left eye. An OCT confirmed an ERM without traction in the right\neye and a moderate PED inferior to the fovea in the left eye. No ocular treatment\nwas initiated at this initial visit. She returned for a follow up 3 weeks after discontinuing\nthe current chemotherapy treatment. At this visit, her PED had significantly decreased\nwithout visual changes and 6 months after she initially presented, her PED had completely\nresolved with remaining retinal mottling at the site.\nConclusion: Previous case studies have shown an association with macular edema during treatment\nof chemotherapy. However, most cases presented binocular findings and without a mention\nof a PED. As presented in other cases, most macular conditions resolve after cessation\nof treatment with the chemotherapy agent(s). Therefore, it is important to acknowledge\nthat patients receiving chemotherapy should have a baseline exam prior to treatment,\nafter starting treatment, as well, as after discontinuing chemotherapy. Communication\nbetween oncologists, primary care doctors and eye care professionals should be emphasized\nwhile patients are treated with known agents that could cause ocular side effects.","title":"Pigment Epithelial Detachment in a Patient Undergoing Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Chemotherapy  Treatment for Endometrial Cancer","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185385\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

A temporal retinal\ntear, 1+ vitreous hemorrhage, and pre-retinal hemorrhage was found OS. His vision\nwas 20/30 OD and 20/30-2 OS. His health history was positive for hyperlipidemia, hypertension,\nand DMII without ocular manifestations. The retinal tear was treated using laser photocoagulation.\nAt the 4-month follow up there was resolution of the vitreous and pre-retinal hemorrhage\nwith no new tears seen.\nVibration and shaking have been shown to have effects\non various tissues in the human body\n1\n. Vibration can be caused by occupational\nenvironment (e.g. pneumatic drill operation), trauma (e.g. shaken baby syndrome),\nand WBV training exercise. Some documented findings of adverse vibration after-effects\ninclude vasospastic diseases in hands\n2\nas well as ocular effects such as\nincreased pigment within the trabecular meshwork, vitreous liquefaction\n3\nand retinal and vitreous bleeding in child abuse\n4\n. In current literature,\nthere has only been two documented cases of vitreous hemorrhage following WBV exercise\n5,6\n.\nBoth of these papers suggest a high probability of correlation between WBV training\nand subsequent vitreous hemorrhage.\nOur patient had utilized a WBV training device\nfor 60 seconds a few hours before the onset of his ocular symptoms. The device used\nby our patient included a footplate on which the user can position him or herself\nthat vibrates at a frequency up to 25-50 Hz. One study details how mechanical resonant\nfrequency can affect the eye, outlining different vibration frequencies between 5\nto 50 Hz with secondary transmission frequency to the eye\n7\n. This study\nsuggests the approximate resonant frequency of the eye to be 18 Hz and a partial resonance\nof 10-12 Hz for the vitreous body\n7\n.\nConclusion: One possible pathogenesis of the retinal tear and vitreous hemorrhage was instigated\nby the vibrations from the machine transmitting a vibratory force to the eye and vitreous.\nIn various types of vitreous-induced retinal tear formation, it is thought that vitreous\nmovement causes shear injury to the retina at the vitreous base. The tear in our patient\noccurred at the vitreous base. The vibratory force probably caused his retinal tear\nand vitreous hemorrhage since the onset of symptoms was within 24 hours of using the\nWBV training device. We believe our patient and those in the Bertschinger and Gillan\npapers strongly suggest that high-force vibration training may cause retinal tears\nin susceptible persons. Though our patient is the third documented case of vitreous\nhemorrhage following WBV training, he is the first to show a close association of\na retinal tear and vitreous hemorrhage with WBV training.","title":"Retinal Tear Formation After WholeBody Vibration WBV Training Exercise","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185386\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Orange County Retina Medical Group\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The tear-air interface defines a surface, which, Ideally, would\nbe smooth and free of undulations. An in-vivo tear surface interferometer (IVV) has\nbeen fabricated to measure the dynamic tear surface shape, in order to investigate\nhow the tear shape may affect visual performance.\nMethods: Tear surface quality was measured with the IVV in 42 subjects at baseline (over bare\neye) and with subjects wearing Acuvue® Oasys with HydraLuxe lenses (AO1D) and habitual\nlenses over three visits. The tear surface shape quality was defined by converting\nthe dynamic tear shapes to a weighted modulation transfer function (WMTF) and subsequently\naveraging the WMTF over the measurement period (10 seconds). The resultant tear shape\nquality metric is referred to as the mean weighted modulation transfer function (MWMTF).\nAny missing MWMTF data were imputed using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method. Paired\ndifferences between the native and prelens MWMTF along with the corresponding 95%\nconfidence intervals were calculated to determine significance.\nResults: The observed mean (over subjects) MWMTF values are shown in Table 1. Differences in\nthe MWMTF between the bare eye and either lens were significant (p < 0.05). The\ndifference between bare eye and AO1D MWMTF was smaller as compared to the difference\nbetween bare eye and habitual MWMTF (p < 0.05).\nConclusion: These results show that the IVV may be capable of measuring subtle differences in\nthe tear quality between bare-eye and prelens tear film and between prelens tear film\nof different lenses.","title":"Prelens Tear Film Measurements Using TwymanGreen Interferometry","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185377\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Johnson & Johnson Vision Care\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Chantal coles-brennan, Kim Hoyt, Xu Cheng\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Design R&D (W-2A)\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This case report shows that serous macular\nschisis in UES can be successfully treated with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor,\nthereby documenting the value of medical therapy in the treatment of UES.","title":"The Expanding Role of Oral CAI Management of a Rare Case of Uveal Effusion Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185380\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA West Los Angeles Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Xiao (Shawn) Yu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA West Los Angeles Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Cases were\ncompared to age- and sex-matched successful soft CL-wearing controls (CLDEQ-8 score\n? 10). Each subject was administered a study-specific questionnaire containing items\nthat queried CL history and compliance: Age at first CL wear; number of years, days/week\nand hours/day of wear; primary CL solution used (multipurpose vs. hydrogen peroxide);\nlens material (conventional vs. silicone hydrogel) and modality (daily disposable/biweekly/monthly\nreplacement); napping/overnight sleeping in CLs, and routine exposure of the lens\ncase or CLs to tap water. Comparisons were made using paired t-tests and McNemar's\ntests for means and frequencies, respectively.\nResults: Fifty-six matched-pairs completed the one-visit study. Mean age (± SD) of cases and\ncontrols were 28.5 ± 7.1 and 28.6 ± 7.0 years, respectively (p = 0.66). There was\nno difference in the age at first CL wear (p = 0.19), although controls had worn CLs\nnearly 3 years longer overall than cases (p = 0.01). Over two-thirds of cases reported\nwearing their CLs ? 4 days/week before dropping out of CLs while nearly the same proportion\nof controls wore their CLs 6-7 days/week (p < 0.001). Cases also had a shorter\naverage wear time by at least 2 hours/day when compared to controls (p < 0.001).\nLens modality, primary CL solution used, CL or case exposure to tap water, on-time\nCL replacement, case replacement at least every 3 months, sleeping in CLs, or wearing\na pair CLs beyond the clinician-recommended timeframe were not associated with CLD\n(all p ? 0.41). Although borderline significant, the odds of controls having worn\na conventional hydrogel CL was higher than that for cases (OR = 2.5, p = 0.05). Controls\nnapped more often in their CLs than cases (p = 0.01).\nConclusion: Successful soft CL wearers are more likely to wear their lenses on or nearly every\nday of the week and for more hours each day than those who eventually dropped out\nof soft CL wear due to discomfort. The material that comprises a soft CL may factor\ninto CLD. CL compliance within this cohort does not appear to be associated with CLD.","title":"Impact of Soft Contact Lens Factors and Compliance on Contact Lens Dropout","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185367\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lisa Jones-Jordan, Sruthi Srinivasan, Justin Kwan, Sebastian Marx, Wolfgang Sickenberger, Lyndon Jones, Andrew Pucker\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, University of Waterloo, Marshall B.

Each subject was administered a study-specific CL questionnaire and a SPEED\nquestionnaire. Clinical testing included non-invasive tear break-up time (NITBUT),\ntear meniscus height (TMH), MG expressibility, meibum quality, and meibography (OCULUS\nKeratograph 5M). MG tortuosity for each eyelid was graded using the 5-point Halleran\nscale (Grade 0: no tortuosity; Grade 4: ?75% of visible MG being tortuous). Worse\neyes (determined by worse eye for tortuosity) comparisons were made with paired t-tests\n(means) or McNemar's test (frequencies).\nResults: Fifty-six matched-pairs were recruited across sites. The mean ± SD age of the cases\n(28.5 ± 7.1 years) and controls (28.6 ± 7.0 years) were not significantly different\n(p = 0.66). The cases had significantly higher SPEED scores than the controls (6.42\n± 4.96 vs. 2.62 ± 2.66; p < 0.001).

While tortuosity may not be a risk factor for CL dropout,\ntortuosity is likely a sign of decreased MG health. Tortuosity may result in altered\ntear lipid production, which could result in decreased meibum expressibility and reduced\ntear volume noted in this study.","title":"Degree of Meibomian Gland Tortuosity in Successful Soft Contact Lens Wearers and Dropouts","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185371\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        JENVIS Research, Ernst Abbe University Jena\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Justin Kwan, Lisa Jones-Jordan, Daniel Powell, Sruthi Srinivasan, Wolfgang Sickenberger, Lyndon Jones, Andrew Pucker\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern California College, Marshall B.

Coefficient of Friction (CoF)\nis a contact lens property that has been correlated with subjective contact lens comfort,\nbut CoF is not measurable in vivo. Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE), a loss of cells\nin the lid wiper region of the eyelid, may be able to serve as a clinical sign demonstrating\nthe impact of CoF on contact lens comfort; however, little is known about the development\nof LWE in new contact lens fits. We investigated the development of LWE in new contact\nlens fits over a 1 week period using soft contact lenses with different CoFs.\nMethods: Twenty subjects without superior eyelid LWE staining at baseline were fit with a high\nCoF contact lens (Air Optix Night & Day Aqua, Alcon Laboratories) in one eye and a\nlow CoF contact lens (Acuvue Oasys, Johnson and Johnson Vision Care) in the contralateral\neye. Lens/eye assignment was randomized at baseline. Two 20 microliter drops of Lissamine\ngreen dye, separated by 5 minutes, were instilled in the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac.\nDigital images of the lid wiper region were taken and graded for LWE staining at 2\nhours and 7 days post-contact lens fit using a 0-3 scale following the grading scheme\nof Korb et al. (CLAO 2002) by 2 trained, masked observers. Non-parametric statistics\nwere performed.\nResults: A significant difference in LWE grading was observed for all eyelids over the evaluation\nperiod (p=0.0004). When evaluating by upper and lower eyelid, a significant change\nwas observed in LWE staining for the upper eyelid (p<0.0001) but not for lower\neyelid (p=0.137). Comparison of the 3 visits for the upper lid revealed a difference\nfrom baseline to 2 hours post fit (p=0.00006) and baseline to 1 week (p=0.00004),\nbut no difference between 2 hours and 1 week post fit (p=0.437). When evaluating by\ncontact lens brand for the upper lid, a significant difference was observed from baseline\nto 2 hours post fit for Acuvue Oasys (p=0.003) and the Air Optix Night and Day (p=0.005)\nand from baseline to 1 week post fit for both lenses (Acuvue Oasys p=0.002; Air Optix\nNight and Day p=0.005). No significant difference was observed between the 2 lenses\nat either 2 hours or at 1 week post fit (p=0.495 and p=0.968, respectively).\nConclusion: LWE staining of the upper eyelids changed significantly between baseline and 2 hours-post\ncontact lens fit and baseline and 7 days-post contact lens fit, but not between 2\nhours and 7 days. There was no significant difference in superior LWE staining development\nbetween the two contact lenses for the evaluation period, suggesting that contact\nlenses with different CoFs may not lead to different amounts of LWE early in the contact\nlens fitting process.","title":"The Effect of Contact Lens Coefficient of Friction on the Development of Lid Wiper  Epitheliopathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185372\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Chuan Hu, Rachel Redfern, Eric Ritchey\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, The University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The study received ethics approval (HREC#15436)\nand was registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN1261500072556).\nMACL were produced by covalently coating lenses (Acuvue 2) with the Mel4 peptide.\nOne hundred and seventy-six participants with a mean age of 22.6 ± 4.2 years were\nrecruited, 74% of which were neophytes. The wearing modality was 14-day extended lens\nwear for a period of three months. After consent, the participants were assessed at\nbaseline, contact lens dispensing, after one-night, two-weeks, one-month, and three-months\nof extended wear, as well as one-month after study completion. Assessment included\ndetailed slit lamp examination for bulbar and limbal redness, palpebral redness and\nroughness, conjunctival and corneal staining, front surface wetting, front and back\nsurface deposits, and the presence of mucin balls, using CCLRU grading scales. Ocular\ncomfort and dryness was measured using a 1-100 score for comfort and the CLDEQ-8 questionnaire\nmodified for monocular lens wear, as well as assessing lens and edge awareness.\nResults: A total of one hundred and thirty-five participants completed the study. No statistically\nsignificant differences were observed in bulbar or limbal redness, palpebral redness\nand roughness in any quadrant between MACL and control lenses (p < 0.05). There\nwere no statistically significant differences in conjunctival (p = 0.46) or corneal\nstaining (p = 0.50) between the two lens types. No statistically significant (p <\n0.05) differences were found for the front surface wetting, front surface deposits\nand back surface debris. Mucin balls were not seen.

Cosmetic products included; 3 hand creams (HC1: Glysomed; HC2: Vaseline Healthy\nHand & Nail Conditioning; HC3: Intense Relieve), 3 make-up removers (MR1: Lid-Care\nTowelettes; MR2: Gentle waterproof eye and Lip Makeup Remover; MR3: Oil-Free Makeup\nRemover), and 3 mascaras (MA1: Great Lash - waterproof; MA2: Wonder'Lash - waterproof,\nMA3: Voluminous Original). Lens diameter, sagittal depth, and base curve were measured\nusing the Chiltern (Optimec Limited), while lens power and optical quality were assessed\nusing the Contest Plus II (Rotlex) (n=6 for each lens/ cosmetic combination). The\nimpact of cosmetics was tested between lenses and compared to baseline (uncoated control\nlenses).\nResults: For lens diameter, makeup removers (MR2 & MR3) had the largest impact, with an increase\nof up to 0.27mm (MR2) and 0.36mm (MR3) for senofilcon C and samfilcon A respectively\n(p<0.01 compared to baseline), while lotrafilcon B+EOBO showed a decrease of only\n0.01mm (p<0.01 between lens types).\nFor sagittal depth, mascara MA1 had the\ngreatest impact, followed by makeup removers MR2 & MR3. All lenses had increases in\nsagittal depth after MA1 exposure (0.16±0.06mm in lotrafilcon B+EOBO, 0.24±0.22 mm\nand 0.26±0.09mm in samfilcon A and senofilcon C respectively; p<0.01 for all lenses\ncompared to baseline).\nFor base curve, the makeup removers (MR2 & MR3) caused\nincreases for both senofilcon C (up to 0.36mm) and samfilcon A (up to 0.45mm), but\nlotrafilcon B+EOBO was unaffected.\nLens power changes were generally minor (less\nthan 0.25D). However, senofilcon C had a significant increase 1.19±0.65D more minus\nafter MA1 exposure (p<0.001).\nImage quality was most effected by mascaras,\nalthough given that all lens types were adversely affected to similar degrees, none\nof the lenses performed better or worse after mascara application (p > 0.05).\nHand\ncreams had no effect on any variable investigated for any lens material.\nConclusion: Overall, mascara MA1 and make-up removers MR2 & MR3 had the largest affect on lens\ndimensions, and mascara MA1 had the largest affect on optical lens properties.

Results of ScCL efficacy studies vary widely based\non historical time point, clinical setting, and study design. The consensus supports\ntheir safety and efficacy for irregular corneas. This retrospective study aims to\nprovide additional information on the safety and efficacy of ScCL use in the visual\nrehabilitation of a diverse post-surgical population in an advanced contact lens clinic\nfrom 2012 to 2017.\nMethods: This study reviewed records of patients seen for ScCL fitting after surgery between\nJanuary 1, 2012 and December 31, 2017 in an academic setting. Eyes included for analysis\nwore ScCL's for at least one year. Primary outcomes analyzed included contact lens\nparameters, manifest refraction (MRE), distance decimal equivalent visual acuities\nthrough MRE (BCVA\nMRE\n), best-corrected distance decimal equivalent visual\nacuities through ScCL (BCVA\nCL\n), steepest keratometry value (K\nMAX\n),\ncomplications occurring during the review period (AE), and reasons for surgery prior\nto fit.\nResults: Ninety-six subjects (N=140 eyes) with average age of 43.y + 15 years (range\n17 to 79 years). The most common surgical procedures prior to referral for ScCL fitting\nincluded penetrating keratoplasty (51%), radial keratotomy (19%), post-LASIK ectasia\n(11%), intra-stromal corneal ring implantation (11%), corneal cross-linking (6%),\nand aphakia (2%). Eleven contact lens brands were used with a mean lens diameter =\n15.7mm + 0.63mm. Sixty-two percent had toric peripheral curve, and 14% had\ntoric optic zones. Mean K\nMAX\n= 47.44D + 7.23D. Mean BCVA\nMRE\n= 0.52 + 0.29 and BCVA\nCL\n= 0.89 + 0.24 (p < 0.0001). Sixty-four\npercent, of eyes fit in a ScCL, achieved BCVA of 1.0 (20/20) or better, 94% achieved\n0.5 (20/40) or better, and 1% experienced no improvement. No eyes experienced a decline\nin distance decimal visual acuity. Nineteen percent of eyes experienced AE's, most\ncommonly tear reservoir fogging (6%), surface deposits (5%), microbial keratitis (3%),\nand corneal edema (2%). Abrasions, hydrops, and solution toxicity occurred in (1%)\nof eyes. Average number of visits after ScCL fit finalization = 4 + 5.1 and\nrefit rate = 0.6 + 0.9.\nConclusion: This study supports ScCL's provide significant improvements in BCVA across a broader\nrange of post-surgical conditions than previously reported.

The difference ranged from 0.25 diopters to\n1.75 diopters flatter than the mean K values. For each video, the average and standard\ndeviation was calculated from the observer responses to determine variability. The\ncorrelation comparing the difference between the on-eye lens BC and mean K and the\nobserver response variability showed a high correlation (r=0.90, p =0.04). The patient's\ncorneal toricities ranged from 0.37 diopters to 2.00 diopters. Differences in corneal\ntoricity had no correlation with observer response variability (r=-0.47, p=0.42).\nConclusion: The closer the BC was to the patient's mean K, the more agreeable the results amongst\nobservers. The amount of corneal toricity had no correlation to observer response\nvariability. When teaching students how to read NaFL patterns, the closer the BC is\nto average K, the more likely the proctors will be in agreement.

This non-invasive alternative to surgery\nhas undergone rapid growth, to the point it is significantly decreasing the volume\nof corneal transplantation. Scleral lens fitting remains a challenging process where\nthe practitioner must maintain ocular surface physiology and balance patient comfort\nwhile fitting a lens. This study investigates effects of scleral lens edge haptics\non ocular surface blood flow via optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).\nMethods: AngioVue OCTA technology with the CAM-L anterior segment adapter (Optovue, Inc)\nand split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation algorithm was used to scan one healthy,\ncontact lens naive subject. Volume cross-sectional scans of 6mm x 6mm were performed\nin each quadrant (nasal, temporal, superior, inferior) midline of the right eye immediately\nafter 1 hour of scleral lens wear. Gaze position control and vessel tracking ensured\nconsistent regional imaging. Image segmentation was performed to capture vasculature\nfrom anterior conjunctiva to posterior sclera, as well as to localize regions of vascular\nnon-perfusion. Slit lamp photography was performed at each time point for biomicroscopy\ncomparison to OCTA scans.\nResults: Local regions of reduced perfusion beneath scleral lens landing zones were visualized\nwith OCTA as the lens haptics were steepened by 30 micron intervals. On further image\nsegmentation, all vessels that demonstrated reduced perfusion with scleral lens application\nwere anterior to the episclera. Reduced perfusion did not necessarily coincide with\nthe clinical appearance of vessel blanching as confirmed in a previous study. We conclude\nthat significant micron changes to scleral lens edge parameters are necessary to induce\nreduced blood vessel perfusion.\nConclusion: The long term effects of scleral lens wear on ocular physiology remain poorly understood.\nThis study begins to investigate how micron changes in scleral lens landing zone can\nconsequently affect blood flow relating to the ocular surface. These changes carry\npotential implications for long term health of ocular tissues and normal physiologic\nfunction. Thus we anticipate this research will have a broad impact on the theory\nof lens to sclera fitting relationship and may help to guide scleral lens manufacturers\nwith future scleral lens designs.","title":"Scleral Lens Haptic Induced Microvascular Changes Revealed by Optical Coherence Tomography  Angiography OCTA","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185361\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Casey Eye Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kelly Voltz\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Casey Eye Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Previously,\nboth Tonopen and iCare had been found to be viable options over plano lenses. This\nstudy compares the same two instruments over both -3.00 D and +3.00 D lenses.\nMethods: Data was collected from 30 healthy Southern College of Optometry students for each\nbranch of the study (60 subjects total). A pachymetry/CCT measurement using RTVue\nOCT was taken on both eyes for all subjects.

Soft multifocal contact lenses can be an option\nfor these patients. However, since near acuity may be normal with these problems,\nreduced near vision cannot be utilized as a feedback tool in fitting as it is for\npresbyopes. The near phoria and response AC/A ratio can serve as an indication of\nthe amount near plus power utilized by patients with multifocal contact lenses.\nThe\npurpose of this study is to compare the ability to provide plus power at near with\nan aspheric center near design multifocal (1-day etafilcon A) compared to a center\ndistance design multifocal (comfilcon A).\nMethods: 20 subjects, between 22-35 years old, with 20/25 or better corrected acuity at distance\nand near with their habitual spectacles and were free from active ocular disease.\nResponse AC/A ratios were calculated at 40cm with habitual spectacles.

BCVA OD at time of dispense was 20/30+2 - final lens parameters\nwere as follows:\nBostonSight PROSE Device: OAD: 19.5mm, Power: 0.75D, BC: 8.50,\nCT: 0.3mm, Material: Boston XO2, 8-Meridian Toric Haptic\nFollow-up visits\nwere conducted at three months and one year. At both visits we noted significant regression\nof corneal pannus and opacity OD. In addition, the patient reports no recurrences\nof keratitis episodes in that timeframe. BCVA OD at her most recent follow up was\n20/20-.\nConclusion: This case demonstrates the importance of optimizing physiologic function in contact\nlens fitting. By modifying the contact lens modality to eliminate the hypoxic and\nmechanical factors leading to vascularization and corneal haze, we were able to achieve\ninactivation and eventual complete regression of corneal pannus.","title":"Management of Progressive Pannus Through Optimization of Contact Lens Function","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185357\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        BostonSight\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, when CSLs do not result in satisfactory visual performance, vision can\nbe further improved by targeting of residual HOAs using a wavefront-guided scleral\nlens (WGSL).\nThis case report describes the use of a WGSL, which delayed\nthe need for corneal transplantation.\n\nCase Report: A 33-year-old male, diagnosed with bilateral keratoconus in 2008, presented for a\ncontact lens fitting at The University of Houston College of Optometry Cornea and\nContact Lens Service in 2014. K\nmax\nOD was 57.7 D and OS was 73.3 D. The\npatient was unsatisfied with the vision provided by soft contact lenses (visual acuity\n(VA) OD: 20/25\n+1\n; OS: 20/100\n-1\n) and was refit into CSL OU and\nVA improved to 20/15 OD and 20/20\n-2\nOS. The patient returned the following\nyear for a comprehensive exam. His VA had decreased to 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS and the\npatient reported more noticeable scattering of lights and starbursts at night. Corneal\ntopography demonstrated disease progression (OS>OD) (K\nmax\nOD: 59.3 D,\nOS: 84.7 D). The CSL prescription was updated and best corrected VA in 2016 was 20/20\nOD and 20/25\n-1\nOS. While VA was improved OS, the patient continued to report\nnoticeable light scatter and starbursts and sought relief from these symptoms. Given\nthe severity of disease OS and his goals for visual correction, the patient was counseled\nregarding corneal transplant.\nWavefront aberrations were measured over the\npatient's CSL. Residual higher order root mean square (HORMS) (5 mm pupil) was 0.475\nµm in the right eye and 1.159 µm in the left eye, both being outside the age-matched\nnormal range. A scleral lens that incorporated the patient's customized residual wavefront\naberration profile was designed and manufactured as part of a research study at The\nUniversity of Houston, College of Optometry. VA (mean of 3 logMAR charts) with the\nWGSLs were 20/16 OD and 20/20\n+3\nOS. The WGSL decreased HORMS to 0.248 µm\nOD and 0.437 µm OS, reducing the reported scatter and starbursts, improving patient\nsatisfaction with both VA and perceptual image quality.\nConclusion: In today's clinic, a patient who continues to experience elevated residual wavefront\naberrations and unsatisfactory visual quality may wish to consider WGSLs prior to\ncorneal transplant to relieve their symptoms.","title":"Correction of Higher Order Wavefront Aberrations Resulting from Severe Keratoconus  Delays Corneal Transplant","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185353\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Matthew Kauffman, Lan Nguyen, Lan Nguyen, Gareth Hastings, Gareth Hastings, Raymond Applegate, Raymond Applegate, Jason Marsack, Jason Marsack\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Frequently, non-preserved\ninhalation saline is used to fill the bowl of these lenses before and during use.\nA common complication with scleral lenses is noticeable fogging of vision after several\nhours of wear. Using a new scleral lens filling solution designed to more closely\nmatch the eye's own tears, we changed only the filling solution for several patients\nin an attempt to improve visual and ocular comfort.\n\nCase Report: Several established scleral lens wearers presented to The Ohio State University College\nof Optometry with fogging. After examination and completion of the Ocular Surface\nDisease Index (OSDI) survey, wearers removed their scleral lenses and refilled them\nwith a non-preserved solution made by a local compounding pharmacy which was made\nto mimic the pH and ion composition of the tears (Stone, 2016 US Patent 2,259,437).\nThese wearers had no adverse reactions to the solution and were dispensed enough solution\nto use over the next week without otherwise changing their normal lens care regimen.\nAt\na one week follow-up examination, wearers were asked to complete the OSDI survey again\nbased upon their experience using the new filling solution.\nPatient 1: A 49 year-old\nmale with keratoconus subjectively reported moderate fogging OD and severe fogging\nOS and had an OSDI score of 56.25 (severe) when using habitual saline solution. At\n1 week follow-up his OSDI score improved to 8.33 (normal) and he noted his fogging\nhad improved and his need to remove and refill lenses was half as frequent with the\ntest solution.\nPatient 2: A 37 year old male with keratoconus subjectively reported\nmoderate fogging OU and a OSDI score of 35.00 (severe) with habitual solution. At\n1 week follow up, OSDI improved to 2.50 (normal) and patient noted subjective improvement\nin comfort and vision.\nPatient 3: A 67 year old male with keratoconus OS subjectively\nreported moderate fogging and had an OSDI score of 22.92 (moderate) when using his\nhabitual saline solution. At his 1 week follow up, his OSDI score had improved to\n14.58 (mild) and the patient had improved visual acuity in his scleral lens wearing\neye.\nConclusion: There are many potential causes of fogging/hazy vision when using scleral lenses.\nThe filling solution used in these cases was shown to improve the patient's subjective\nlevels of comfort while otherwise maintaining their current lens care regimens. Continued\ndevelopment of more advanced solutions could potentially improve the wearing experience\nfor many scleral lens patients.","title":"Improvement in Comfort in Established Scleral Contact Lens Wearers Using Novel Filling  Solution","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185354\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Matthew Karres, Jennifer Fogt, Jennifer Fogt, Joseph Barr, Joseph Barr\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

This improved performance\nis predicated on many factors, among them, proper alignment of the optics of the WGSL\nto the underlying optics of the eye, with misalignment leading to reduced performance.\nThe\npurpose of this case report is to demonstrate the necessity of aligning a WGSL optical\ncorrection over a capsular opening that is displaced from the pupil center, in an\neye having undergone neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser treatment to\nmanage capsular opacification secondary to lens extraction.\n\nCase Report: A 34 year old female enrolled in a study examining WGSL performance, reporting a history\nof failed LASIK in her left eye, which led to a penetrating keratoplasty and an extracapsular\nextraction of her crystalline lens, followed by a Nd:Yag laser posterior capsulotomy.\nHabitual Snellen acuity (aided with a conventional scleral lens) was 20/25, residual\nHO root mean square (RMS) wavefront error was 0.29µm (?=4.75mm), and objective over-refraction\nwas -0.30 -0.54 x 008. When a WGSL (targeting aberrations up to the 5th radial order)\nwas manufactured with the wavefront-guided optics aligned to the center of the dilated\npupil, Snellen acuity worsened to 20/30, residual HORMS increased (worsened) to 0.45µm\n(?=4.75mm), and objective over-refraction increased to +1.20 -0.31 x 122. Review of\nthe measured wavefront error and slit lamp imagery revealed differences between the\ndistances from the geometric center of the scleral lens to (1) the center of the dilated\npupil (x= 0.78mm, y=-0.67mm) and to (2) the center of the capsular opening (x=1.04mm,\ny=-1.839) . When the WGSL was redesigned to align the wavefront-guided optics to the\ncenter of the capsular opening, Snellen acuity improved to 20/15, residual HORMS reduced\nto 0.20µm (?=4.75mm) and objective over-refraction reduced to +0.27 -0.20 x 093.\nConclusion: WGSL is an emerging option for patients with highly aberrated eyes whose visual symptoms\ncannot be alleviated with conventional corrections available in today's clinic. However,\nproper alignment of the optics of the WGSL to the underlying optics of the eye is\ncritical in maximizing optical and visual performance.","title":"Alignment of a WavefrontGuided Scleral Lens Correction in the Presence of a Lens  Capsulotomy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185355\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Matthew Kauffman, Gareth Hastings, Raymond Applegate, Jason Marsack\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The most common instrument of choice is an open field auto refractor\nsuch as Grand Seiko WAM-5500. However, in a regular clinic situation where space and\nbudget are in consideration when purchasing an instrument, many practitioners often\nconsider an instrument with multiple functions to measure refraction, corneal topography\nand aberrometry such as Nidek OPD-Scan III. The purpose of this study was to compare\na commonly used open field autorefractor for measuring peripheral refraction with\na multi-function unit OPD-Scan III.\nMethods: Twenty adult subjects were recruited. The participants were seven emmetropes and thirteen\nmyopes. Participants age ranged from 23.5 to 39 years old. Central and peripheral\nrefraction were measured using open field auto refractor Grand Seiko WAM-5500 and\na wavefront aberrometer OPD-Scan III. The sequence of two examiners and two instruments\nwere randomized. Baseline measurements included axial length, corneal topography,\nkeratometry, intra-ocular pressure, visual acuity and pupil size. Refractive errors\nwere measured before and after dilation. All measurements were done only on the right\neye which was dilated using 0.5% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine. The left eye\nwas occluded during measurements to avoid diplopia. A total of seven horizontal fixation\nlocations were used for both instruments starting from the center and 10, 20 and 30\ndegrees temporally and nasally. Spherical equivalent was used to compute the refractive\nerror in each angle. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the differences\nbetween instruments, and the refractive error profile for each device groups across\nall measured visual field meridians.\nResults: Refractive error type, device, angle, and the interaction between the device and angle\nwere all significant with p = < .001. Nidek OPD-Scan III provided consistently\nmore minus measurements than the Grand Seiko. The triple interaction of refractive\nerror type, angle, and device was not significantly different with p = 0.132.\nConclusion: In conclusion, the two devices provided consistent differences and should not be used\ninterchangeably.","title":"Comparing Peripheral Refraction Measurements Using Open Field and MultiFunction Autorefractors","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185347\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Richard Wu, John Hayes, Patrick Caroline, Matthew Lampa, Gary Mikaelian\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry, Pacific University College of Optometry, Pacific University College of Optometry, Pacific University College of Optometry, Nidek Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Evaluating either of these requires\nan accurate estimate of peripheral refraction, which is often used to make inferences\nabout ocular shape. Peripheral refraction profiles can be evaluated using a quadratic\nequation derived from plotting spherical equivalent refractive error against the visual\nfield position. The purpose of this study is to determine the validity and repeatability\nof peripheral refraction profiles using two instruments capable of measuring infants,\nthe SureSight (Welch Allyn) and PowerRefractor (Plusoptix), in comparison with the\ngold standard Grand Seiko WR-5100K in order to determine the most suitable instrument\nto use with infant populations.\nMethods: Subjects were 21 adults (16 female) with an acuity of 20/25 or better in the right\neye who had no history of ocular disease, active inflammation, ocular surgery, strabismus,\nor rigid contact lens wear. Measurements included cycloplegic (1% tropicamide) central\nand peripheral autorefraction at 30°and 20°temporal and nasal gazes of the right eye\non the Grand Seiko WR-5100K (10 readings), SureSight (5 readings), and PowerRefractor\n(5 readings) in random order. Measurements were made at two visits separated by at\nleast 24 hours. The validity of quadratic and linear coefficients derived from the\nSureSight and PowerRefractor was assessed using paired t-test comparisons to the Grand\nSeiko WR-5100K. Measurement repeatability was assessed using 95% limits of agreement\n(LoA; 1.96 x SD of differences) between visits 1 and 2 for each instrument.\nResults: The SureSight quadratic and linear coefficients were not significantly different from\nthe Grand Seiko WR-5100K (p<0.72). The PowerRefractor quadratic coefficient was\nnot significantly different from the Grand Seiko WR-5100K (p<0.97) but the linear\ncoefficient was (difference = -0.011; p<0.01). There were no significant differences\nin the quadratic coefficients between visits for any instrument (p<0.94). There\nwas no significant difference in the linear coefficient value between visits for the\nGrand Seiko WR-5100K and PowerRefractor (p<0.55) while the SureSight did show a\ndifference between visits (difference = -0.0026; p<0.04).

The results of this literature search were used to identify appropriate\nPROs for inclusion in clinical trials to measure patient-reported near visual function\nand satisfaction.\nMethods: Literature searches were performed in Medline and Embase up until October 2017. Specific\nsearch terms were used to identify studies in presbyopia that have included a PRO\ninstrument. In addition, all clinical trials with PRO endpoints in presbyopia were\nidentified on clinicaltrials.gov. Further searches were conducted to retrieve articles\ndocumenting the development and psychometric evaluation of any PROs identified from\nthe aforementioned searches. The measurement characteristics of the tools were reviewed\nin line with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA)\nregulatory guidance for PROs.\nResults: A total of 746 abstracts were identified for initial screening. Of these, 120 were\nselected for full-text review. Articles reporting on the QoL of patients with presbyopia\nhighlighted the impact on patients' daily lives. In addition to the published literature\nregarding PROs, there were 21 clinical trials that employed PROs to support a primary\nor secondary endpoint. In total, 13 PROs were identified; a further 23 publications\npertaining to development and validation of these tools were retrieved. Based on the\nanalysis of available evidence for the 13 PROs, the Near Activity Visual Questionnaire\n(NAVQ) was identified as the most appropriate for assessing near vision functioning\nin presbyopia. While the NAVQ was developed in line with the FDA guidelines, its validity\nhas not been confirmed specifically in a presbyopia population as it was developed\nfor use in pseudophakic patients. Furthermore, the items do not reflect changes in\ntechnology, which have occurred since the questionnaire was developed in 2008 (e.g.\nthe increase in smartphone use).\nConclusion: The NAVQ has the most potential to support trial endpoints related to changes in near-vision\nfunctioning associated with presbyopia.

The theory and clinical\nevaluation of this computer controlled method are described.\nMethods: Subjective refractions were measured on the right eyes on 20 young observers (12F,8M),\nmean age 24 (SD3)years. Two measures were made with standard Jackson Cross-Cylinder\n(JCC) and two with the Bearing Fixing (BF) technique. Bearing Fixing involved computer\ncontrolled iterative psychophysics: taking axis measurements with a computer generated\nastigmatic fan. Each trial used a pair of known cylinder corrections approximately\n1D from, and approximately orthogonal in double polar coordinates to, the previous\nestimate of astigmatism. Six successive estimates were made, with the last four estimates\nbeing vector averaged to give the BF cylinder axis and correction. Acuity measures\nwere taken with each astigmatic sphere correction.\nResults: Mean cylinder magnitude was 0.81DC (SD 0.78DC, Max 3.00DC Min 0.25DC). On average,\nBF measurements did not differ significantly from JCC measurement (Î”J\n0\n=0.03D,p=0.226;\nÎ”J\n45\n=0.03D,p=0.104). Individual BF measurements differed from JCC measurements\nby an average of 0.25DC (SD0.16DC, Max 0.58DC, Min 0.033DC) calculated using vectors.\nMean visual acuity was logMAR -.10 with JCC correction and logMAR-0.09 with BF correction,\na difference that was not significant (p=.34). Test-retest difference was significantly\n(P<0.01) larger for BF measurements (average magnitude 0.41DC, SD 0.26DC, Min 0.036DC,\nMax 1.06DC) than for JCC measurements (average magnitude 0.22DC, SD 0.14DC, Min 0.0DC,\nMax 0.50DC).\nConclusion: Bearing Fixing shows promise as a refractive technique. It involves simple judgements\nfor a patient to make and gives equivalent visual acuity outcomes and refraction outcomes\nto JCC measurements. There are a number of potential psychophysical modifications\nwhich may be made to improve its test-retest variability. It may be a useful refractive\ntechnique for modern computer-controlled phoropters.","title":"Bearing Fixing A New Subjective Method for Determination of Astigmatic Cylinder Power  and Axis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185337\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        QUT\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jia Hao Ng, Jia Sheng Choo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        QUT, QUT\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

(New York, NY), an accredited member of the Eye Bank Association\nof America. The corneas had been donated by thirty different organ donors (seventeen\nmale, thirteen female) of average age 60.9 ± 10.1 (range 46 to 78) years. The corneas\nwere stored in OptiSol (Bausch+Lomb, Rochester, NY) solution and were maintained at\n4°C. The corneas were subjected to either myopic SMILE or femtosecond laser-assisted\nLASIK. Treatments applied: group-A -3.00D (diopters) SMILE, group-B -8.00D SMILE,\ngroup-C -3.00D LASIK, group-D -8.00D LASIK. Additionally, two control groups were\nformed: group-E SMILE and group-F LASIK. All groups consisted of five corneas, randomly\nallocated. The corneas in the control groups were subjected to the corresponding femtosecond-laser\nlamellar cuts but not to tissue removal. Evaluation of biomechanical tensile strength\nwas conducted by biaxial force application. The Biotester 5000 system (CellScale Biomaterials\nTesting, Waterloo, ON, Canada) was employed to provide biaxial load cell-based in-plane\ntensile tests. The specimens were fixed (randomly orientated) via a 4Ã—5-tine rake\narrangement on their center 3.5Ã—3.5 mm square section. The tines were of 250 Î¼m diameter,\nspaced apart by 0.7 mm. Shear rate was 4.16 Î¼m/sec. Testing was performed until the\nfirst sign of slippage, indicated by an abrupt change in the force-strain curve, displayed\nreal-time in the system monitor. Primary outcome measures were stress at 10% and 15%\nstrain, and Young's modulus at 10% and 15% strain.\nResults: In SMILE, the average relative difference (Î”) of the four outcome measures was -34.46%\nbetween -3.00D correction versus control-E and -49.34% between -8.00D correction versus\ncontrol-E. In LASIK, average Î” was -24.88% between -3.00D correction versus control,\nand -52.73% between -8.00D correction versus control. When comparing same myopic correction,\nSMILE compared to LASIK appears to result in more biomechanical reduction for -3.00D\ncorrections by -26%, while a non-statistically significant difference was noted in\n-8.00D corrections, SMILE being better.\nConclusion: Biomechanical tensile strength is reduced with increasing amount of myopia corrected\nin both procedures. Biomechanical tensile strength is reduced with increasing amount\nof myopia corrected in both procedures. SMILE appears to result in less corneal tensile\nstrength reduction for higher myopic corrections. LASIK appears to result in less\nstrength reduction in smaller myopic corrections.","title":"Biaxial Tensile Strength Corneal Biomechanical Evaluation Comparative Study of SMILE  Versus LASIK","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185339\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Pikeville\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Differences between manufactured and measured\nOC heights also showed statistically significant differences (Glassify\n®\n4.50\n± 2.66mm, p < 0.001 ; Clearly\n®\n3.30 ± 2.47mm, p < 0.001 ; Zenni\n®\n4.22\n± 2.58mm, p < 0.001 - one sample t-test, 0 vs. difference between measurements).\nMost measurements were outside of clinically significant tolerance limits (ISO norm,\n± 0.84mm for vertical centering): 94% (n = 68) for Glassify\n®\n, 93% (n =\n67) for Clearly\n®\nand 90% (n = 65) for Zenni\n®\n.\nConclusion: Online spectacles ordering, using patient-measured PD and lack of personalized OC\nheights, is often outside the recognized optical industry standards and may lead to\nsignificant optical errors.","title":"Ordering Spectacles Online How Good are Patients at Taking Measurements","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185342\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Camille DescÃ´teaux, Danielle Richard, Marie-Maxime Bellemare, Benoit Tousignant\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Vignetted rays fail to be imaged on the far nasal\nretina causing reduced retinal illuminance, which is seen as a dark shadow. The goal\nwas to psychophysically measure vignetting and visual sensitivity in an experimental\nmodel of far-temporal field vignetting using an opaque annular contact lens (CL) axially\nseparated from the iris plane.\nMethods: Right eyes of three phakic subjects aged 22, 44 and 63 years with normal ocular history\nwere cyclopleged with 1% Tropicamide solution. Outer limits of the VF were measured\nusing a Goldmann bowl perimeter and VF sensitivities were measured along the horizontal,\ninferior and infero-temporal meridians using an Octopus perimeter. Vignetting across\nthe horizontal temporal field was measured psychophysically using a custom developed\ninstrument using beam incident angles of 4\n0\n, 50\n0\n, 60\n0\n,\n70\n0\n, 80\n0\nand 90\n0\n. For each incident angle, a highly\nvisible beam of 0.55 mm diameter was translated horizontally from temporal to nasal\nlimbus and back across the pupil in 0.25 mm steps. Subjects pressed a button when\nthe beam was seen. All measurements were performed on the naked eye and after the\ninsertion of a soft CL with 5.50 mm central clear zone and 12 mm opaque annulus.\nResults: Goldmann and Octopus data revealed a 10\n0\nreduction in the horizontal and\ninfero-temporal field extent with no reduction in their inferior field with the annular\nCL. The reduction in field sensitivity with the annular CL ranged from -0.44 to -3.78\ndB from 50\n0\nto 90\n0\nin the temporal field, and from -0.56 to\n-7.22 dB from 50\n0\nto 90\n0\nin the infero-temporal field, but only\n-0.44 to -0.72 dB for 50\n0\nto 60\n0\nin the inferior field. Psychophysical\n50% detection of the beam revealed an effective horizontal pupil diameter that decreased\nfrom 8.18 to 2.89 mm as field angle increased from 4\n0\nto 90\n0\n.\nWith the annular CL, effective horizontal pupil diameters decreased from 5.44 to 0.61\nmm as field angles increased from 4\n0\nto 90\n0\n. The smaller CL\naperture reduced effective pupil to 67% on-axis and to 22% at 90\n0\nrevealing\nincreased vignetting as field angles increased. Slit lamp imaging and ray tracing\nmodeling using measured pupil sizes and anterior chamber depths also confirm significant\nbut partial vignetting at these large field angles.\nConclusion: The opaque annular CL axially separated from the iris plane caused partial vignetting\nof light rays in the far-temporal VF resulting in reduced visual sensitivity and the\nappearance of a thin dark crescent in the far-temporal field. The results confirm\nthat partial vignetting can create far-temporal field ND and an accompanying constriction\nof the visual field.","title":"Impact of Vignetting on Peripheral Field Sensitivity in Phakic Eyes with Simulated  Negative Dysphotopsia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185343\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Dawn Meyer, Pete Kollbaum, Arthur Bradley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Placing such an order requires an accurate prescription, a properly\nacquired pupillary distance measurement, and knowledge of lens materials. The consumer\nmay not be aware of the importance of these parameters with respect to the accuracy\nof a pair of spectacles. Because eye care providers have concerns about patients directly\nordering frames and lenses from online venders, the aim of this study is to evaluate\nthe quality of eyewear purchased online in terms of prescription accuracy, proper\nframe adjustment, and overall experience of ordering the product.\nMethods: Ten online spectacle retailers were selected based on the most prominent results of\na web search. Single vision lenses were ordered from each vendor using an up-to-date\nprescription and pupillary distance measurement. Two orders were placed from each\nwebsite two weeks apart. Lens materials, photochromic materials, and anti-reflective\ncoatings were selected based on the availability and recommendations of a given website.\nOnce an order was received, a score was computed based on the accuracy of the lenses\nas measured by a lensometer, the presentation and quality of the order, the delivery\ntime, and the presence of any amenities provided by the retailer to aid in placing\nand returning the order. This score was then compared to the cost of the order.\nResults: The accuracy of the lenses in each order was compared to the tolerances recommended\nby the American National Standards Institute. Thirteen of the twenty orders placed\nwere out of tolerance, with cylinder power and axis orientation as the primary reasons\nfor failure. Delivery times ranged from 3 to 29 business days (average 9.4 ± 5.3 days).\nThe cost of each order varied from $45 to $330 (average $182).\nConclusion: More than half of the orders were found to have at least one parameter out of tolerance\nwith respect to lens accuracy. No correlation was identified between the quality and\ncost of the eyewear evaluated in this study.","title":"Comparative Analysis of the Performance of Online Spectacle Retailers","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185344\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Michigan College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        James Brady, Craig Norman\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Michigan College of Optometry, Michigan College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

VA measurement\nsystems and lighting conditions may affect VA results. This study aims to determine\nif the conditions of VA measurements taken in different examination rooms respect\nstandards of illumination, luminance and contrast. It also aims to assess if the degree\nof conformity to standards varies with the type of visual acuity system (manual slide\nprojector, electronic slide projector and backlit displays).\nMethods: Sixteen eye clinics, for a total of 31 examination rooms (10 manual projectors, 11\nelectronic projectors and 10 backlit displays) were assessed. Room illuminance and\nbackground luminance (taken at the four corners and at the center on the chart) were\nrecorded with Hagner Universal Photometer S2 (luminancemeter and luxmeter combined).\nThe Michelson contrast was calculated from luminance and averaged over the same five\npoints. Best corrected monocular VA was measured on the same participant in every\nexamination room.\nResults: Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare medians with the standards of room illumination\n(? 400 lux), contrast (? 90%), luminance (? 80 cd/m2) and variation in luminance (?\n20%). Room illumination (median = 275 lux, IQR = 380) and chart contrast (median =\n79%, IQR = 30.0) were significantly lower than standards (both p < 0.001). Background\nluminance (median = 102 cd/m2, IQR = 85) was not significantly inferior to standards\n(p = 1.000). Variations in background luminance (median = 32%, IQR = 44%) did not\nmeet standards (p < 0.001).

Study visits were between the hours of\n8:00AM to 12PM on Days 0, 7 (± 2 days) and 28 (± 3 days). At Day 0, two drops (?20µl\neach) of combined 2% SF/1% LG solution were instilled in the inferior conjunctival\nsac of both eyes 5 min. apart. For the Day 7 and Day 28 visits, the eye with the least\nlid wiper staining from Day 0 was randomly assigned to one of three staining arms:\n1) continuation of combined 2% SF/1% LG solution; 2) one drop (?20µl) of liquid 1%\nLG applied to SF strip, touched strip to the inferior conjunctival sac, wait 1 min.;\n3) one drop (?20µl) of liquid 1% LG instilled in the inferior conjunctival sac, wait\n5 min., one drop (?20µl) of liquid 2% SF instilled in the inferior conjunctival sac,\nwait 1 min. At all visits, digital slit lamp images were captured of the lower and\nupper eyelid of each eye following the final wait period post-dye application, saved\nand graded for LWE by height and width following the grading scheme of Korb et al.\n(CLAO 2002) by two masked, trained examiners. In addition, an overall staining grade\nwas determined by averaging the height and width grades. In cases of any disagreement\nin grades between the two readers, a third examiner served as a referee. Nonparametric\nstatistics were used to evaluate all outcomes.\nResults: No significant difference was observed in LWE staining of the upper and lower eyelids\ncombined for width, height and overall grade between the 2% SF/1% LG solution at Day\n0 and any of the three staining arms at the Day 7 and Day 28 visits (all p > 0.07).\nWhen comparing the lower and upper eyelids separately for height, width and overall\nstaining across all three staining arms, there was a significant difference in width\n(p = 0.026), but not for height and overall lid wiper staining (both p ? 0.05).\nConclusion: The alternate staining methods evaluated in this study provide similar results to\nthe 2% SF/1% LG solution in the assessment of LWE. For all the LWE staining methods,\nthe degree of staining appears to be repeatable over time. The degree of lid wiper\nstaining between all staining methods is comparable for both upper and lower eyelids\ndespite a difference in the staining width, which is likely attributable to the high\nnumber of comparisons conducted in the statistical analysis.","title":"Assessment of Alternative Staining Methods for Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185328\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        James Wolffsohn, Eric Ritchey, Carolina Kunnen\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Aston University, UK, University of Houston College of Optometry, Alcon Research, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Symptoms typically\ninclude ocular pain and discomfort and vision disturbances. Accurate measurement of\ndisease severity and symptoms is critical to successfully treating and managing DED.\nWe investigated the usefulness of the eye dryness score (EDS) as a single item tool\nto assess severity of DED symptoms.\nMethods: This cross-sectional online survey in the US included 1003 adults (?18 years) with\nself-reported DED. DED symptoms were assessed by: EDS (visual analog scale, range\n0-100 [0=no discomfort, 100=maximum discomfort]); ocular comfort index (OCI, range\n0-72); 5-item dry eye questionnaire (DEQ-5, range 0-22); standard patient evaluation\nof eye dryness (SPEED, range 0-28); symptom assessment in dry eye (SANDE, range 0-100);\nMcMonnies Questionnaire (range 0-36). EDS assesses symptom discomfort, OCI and DEQ-5\nassess intensity and frequency of symptoms, SPEED and SANDE assess frequency and severity\nof symptoms, and McMonnies assesses symptoms and risk factors. Higher scores indicate\nworse symptoms on all scales. Participants were classified into 3 groups by increasing\nseverity on the EDS scale: EDS<40 (group 1), 40?EDS<60 (group 2), and EDS?60\n(group 3). For all groups, the OCI, DEQ-5, SPEED, SANDE and McMonnies scores (mean\n± SD, minimum-maximum range) were calculated.\nResults: Number of participants by EDS group were: group 1, n=492; group 2, n=199; group 3,\nn=312. Mean ± SD (range) OCI scores were: group 1, 24 ± 14 (0-72); group 2, 33 ± 12\n(6-62); group 3, 40 ± 13 (5-72). DEQ-5, SPEED, SANDE, and McMonnies questionnaires\nwere completed by n=502 participants (group 1, n=251; group 2, n=99; group 3, n=152).\nScores for DEQ-5, SPEED, SANDE and McMonnies questionnaires were also higher (indicating\nworse symptoms) in groups with higher EDS. DEQ-5 scores were: group 1, 9 ± 4 (0-22);\ngroup 2, 12 ± 3 (5-20); group 3, 13 ± 4 (0-22). SPEED scores were: group 1, 9 ± 5\n(0-28); group 2, 12 ± 5 (0-24); group 3, 14 ± 6 (0-28).

Here, we report resistance\nrates and trends among conjunctival-sourced ocular isolates collected across the US\nfrom 2009 through 2017.\nMethods: Conjunctival isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci\n(CoNS), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas\naeruginosa were obtained from clinical centers across the US as part of the ongoing\nARMOR surveillance study. Susceptibility testing against various antibiotics was performed\nat a central laboratory, and isolates were classified as susceptible, intermediate,\nor resistant per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology and interpretive\ncriteria, where available. Staphylococci were classified as methicillin-resistant\n(MR) or methicillin-susceptible (MS) based on susceptibility to oxacillin. Longitudinal\ntrends were evaluated using a Cochran-Armitage test for linear trends in a proportion.\nResults: A total of 1353 isolates (545 S. aureus, 343 CoNS, 236 H. influenzae,\n131 S. pneumoniae, and 98 P. aeruginosa) were collected from the conjunctiva\nof patients with presumed bacterial conjunctivitis at 58 sites. A large proportion\nof staphylococci demonstrated resistance to oxacillin (29-50%) and azithromycin (57-64%),\nwhile resistance was low against the majority of antibiotics tested for S. pneumoniae,\nP. aeruginosa, and H. influenzae. Multidrug resistance (?3 antibiotic\nclasses) was found in 28% of S. aureus and 40% of CoNS isolates, and was substantially\nincreased among methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MR S. aureus [MRSA], 76%;\nMRCoNS, 72%). Over the nine-year study period, there were small yet significant decreases\nin resistance rates among S. aureus to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin,\ntrimethoprim, and oxacillin (P?0.006), among CoNS to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim\n(P?0.007), and among P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin and tobramycin (P?0.03).\nConclusion: In this cumulative analysis of conjunctival isolates collected to date in ARMOR, in\nvitro antibiotic resistance was found to be high, albeit with trends of decreased\nresistance from 2009 through 2017 for certain antibiotic/pathogen combinations.","title":"Antibiotic Resistance Among ConjunctivalSourced Ocular Pathogens Collected in the  ARMOR Surveillance Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185333\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Bausch + Lomb, a division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Penny Asbell, Heleen DeCory\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Bausch + Lomb, a division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The patient had a history of congenital\nnystagmus. Previous attempts to wear both soft and gas permeable contact lenses were\nunsuccessful. On examination, his manifest refraction was -0.50 -6.00 x 137 (20/40\n-1\n)\nin the right eye and -2.25 -2.25 x 30 (20/40\n-1\n) in the left eye. Preoperative\ncorneal topography (ATLAS 9000; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) and tomography\n(Orbscan IIz; Bausch and Lomb, Rochester, NY, and Pentacam; Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany)\nwere normal. The patient's contrast sensitivity (CSV-1000; VectorVision, Greenville,\nOH) was below normal at 3 cycles per degree (cpd) and recorded as \"˜none' at 6, 12,\nand 18 cpd in both eyes. Given the nystagmus and possibility of dynamic tracking errors\nduring LASIK, it was decided SMILE was the safest option due to the fact the entire\nrefractive portion of the treatment is performed with the eye immobilized under suction.\nSMILE treatment was performed using the 500 kHz VisuMax femtosecond laser (Carl Zeiss\nMeditec AG; Jena, Germany). Particular care and attention was required during docking\nfor this patient due to the involuntary nystagmus eye movements. Proper centration\nwas achieved on the first attempt. The cornea was then immobilized for the entirety\nof the lenticule creation, thus achieving perfect treatment centration. The lenticule\ninterface separation and extraction was performed using a standard technique. One\nyear after surgery, the patient reported no subjective complaints and had an uncorrected\ndistance visual acuity (UDVA) of 20/40 in the right eye with a manifest refraction\nof +0.25 -0.25 x 130 (20/40) and UDVA of 20/40 in the left eye with a manifest refraction\nof +0.25 DS (20/40). An OCT B Scan (RTVue; Optovue, Fremont, CA) was normal with no\ntissue irregularities at the interface level for both eyes. Corneal topography was\nregular in both eyes, with a difference map for the right eye (high cylinder treatment)\nshowing a perfectly centered treatment (Figure 2). The contrast sensitivity was unchanged\nfrom before surgery.\nConclusion: SMILE, in eyes with nystagmus, is a feasible treatment option and larger controlled\nstudies will help determine if the technology can provide even better centration control\ncompared to standard eye-tracking software used in LASIK/PRK.","title":"Performing SMILE in a Patient with High Astigmatism and Nystagmus  A Case Report","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185334\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        London Vision Clinic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Dan Reinstein, Glenn Carp, Timothy Archer\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        London Vision Clinic, London Vision Clinic, London Vision Clinic\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

For patients who have had prior LASIK or\nPRK (either hyperopic or myopic) or Radial Keratotomy (RK), it is recommended to use\nthe web-based American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) IOL power\ncalculator to factor these corneal changes into account. In most cases, the ASCRS\nIOL calculator does not fail to accurately predict the most suitable lens power. This\ncase report presents a situation in which the ASCRS calculator did not predict accurately\nleaving a patient with significant refractive error post-cataract surgery.\n\nCase Report: A 58-year-old Caucasian female with a history of prior myopic LASIK OU and prior myopic\nPRK OU presented to our clinic for a cataract pre-operative exam. She complained of\nblur with associated glare at night OU developing over the course of one year. She\npresented with UCDVA 20/100 OD, 20/30 OS and UCNVA J2 OD, J5 OS. Her manifest refraction\nwas OD -2.00 -1.25 x 005 correctable to 20/40, OS -0.25 -0.75 x 165 correctable to\n20/30. BAT testing (medium) was 20/150 OD, 20/50 OS. Slit lamp examination (SLEx)\nshowed moderate nuclear sclerotic cataracts OU. Since OS is her dominant eye, surgery\nwas first done on OD with a goal of -2.00D to provide the patient with reading vision.\nWhen calculating the IOL power, the ASCRS calculator factored in her OD pre-LASIK\nand PRK refraction of -8.00 -3.25 x 010 as well as her post-LASIK and PRK refraction.\nThe average IOL predicted power was calculated to be +21.40D and an Alcon SA60WF lens\nwith a power of +20.00D was implanted for a predicted refractive error of -2.27D.\nUpon the patient's 1 day post-op, patient reported blur OD and her presenting UCDVA\nwas 20/150. SLEx showed mild corneal edema and 1+ cells in anterior chamber OD. On\nher 1-week post-op exam, patient complained that her near vision is blurry. Her UCDVA\nwas 20/40 with UCNVA of J5 OD. Manifest refraction was +0.25 -0.50 x 010 correctable\nto 20/25- meaning that the patient was overcorrected by approximately 2.25D. The patient\nis scheduled to return for her 1-month post-op exam and a possible enhancement may\nbe in order after her 3-month post op.\nConclusion: The ASCRS calculator has been the gold standard in predicting IOL powers of patients\nwith prior LASIK/ PRK and RK. It uses the double-K method modification of the Holladay\n1 formula which uses the corneal power prior to LASIK and/ or PRK to estimate the\neffective IOL position. Newer and more advanced technologies such as the Barrett True\nK and the optical coherence tomography (OCT) formula based IOL calculators are undergoing\nfurther studies to achieve better and more reliable results.","title":"An Uncommon Case of Significant Overcorrection PostCataract Surgery with the Use  of the WebBased American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery ASCRS IOL Power  Calculator","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185335\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Reingold Eye Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Amanda Setto\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dougherty Laser Vision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

To date, studies investigating normal, age-related changes to corneal\nthickness and curvature have focused on global indices and measurements of the central\nand paracentral cornea. Global indicators, however, have limited utility in identifying\nSCE and variants affecting the midperipheral and peripheral cornea. This study aimed\nto develop models based on clustering algorithms to characterise patterns of age-related\nchanges to corneal thickness (CT), front surface sagittal curvature (FSSC) and back\nsurface sagittal curvature (BSSC) measurements to facilitate improved diagnostics.\nMethods: Single eyes of normal subjects (age range 8-60) were retrospectively recruited from\nthe Centre for Eye Health (Sydney, Australia). CT, FSSC & BSSC measurements were obtained\nwith the Pentacam HR. A total of 57 point measurements covering a central corneal\ndiameter of 8.00mm were extracted using the instrument software. Hierarchical and\nK-means clustering algorithms were applied to identify statistically separable clusters\nthat showed similar change with age. Quadratic and linear regression models were fitted\nto each cluster pattern to characterise change as a function of age, and comparisons\nbetween the various models was determined using F test, with statistical significance\nset at p=0.05.\nResults: For both clustering methods, concentric patterns were observed in CT and FSSC, while\npatterns for BSCC appeared more random (Figure 1). Quadratic and linear regression\nmodels applied to the resultant clusters varied with regard to rates of change with\nage between clusters (Figures 2&3). Generally, peripheral clusters tended to show\nmore rapid corneal thinning and steepening compared to central clusters for CT and\nFSSC measurements respectively, while the BSSC clusters showed variable regression\npatterns. For CT and FSSC, R\n2\nvalues ranged between 0.17-0.81 for quadratic\nmodels and 0.007-0.35 for linear models, and for BSSC, R\n2\nvalues ranged\nbetween 0.002-0.66 for quadratic models and 0.002-0.38 for linear models. F test showed\nthat quadratic models showed superior accuracy in describing regression compared to\nlinear models for most clusters.\nConclusion: Clustering algorithms revealed statistically separable clusters showing similar age-related\nchange across a wide area of the cornea. While concentric patterns of change were\nobserved for CT and FSSC, the random BSSC patterns and poor fit of regression models\nsuggested excessive variability in BSSC within normals, and hence its use in diagnosis\nof SCE may be limited.

These wounds are extremely difficult to treat on\nthe battlefield and the repercussions of penetrating ocular wounds on the internal\nocular structures remain unknown. The objective of this study was to expand the use\nof a bench top, full-thickness, corneal penetrating ocular injury model to determine\nwhether commercially available bio-adhesives are capable of sufficiently sealing such\nwounds. We hypothesized that the shape of the wound (i.e. stellate) would have the\nmost influence on how well these types of wounds seal with temporary adhesives.\nMethods: A bench top penetrating eye injury model, using a Murphy 12 DC solenoid (E-Motion\nInc.) device controlled by Lab View Software (National Instruments), was developed\nusing stainless-steel penetrating probes to create penetrating ocular wounds along\nthe visual axis. Broad-head penetrating probes of different sizes and shapes were\nattached to the solenoid drive shaft to create a full-thickness, penetrating corneal\nwound in explanted porcine eyes. High speed video (nac MEMRECAM HX-4) was used to\nrecord the penetration of the cornea. Four commercially available bio-adhesives were\nused as temporary sealants for the created wound. Real-time intraocular pressure was\nmeasured and recorded (AD Instruments) throughout the procedure which included penetrating\nocular wounds, application of the temporary bio-adhesive sealant, and re-inflation\nof the porcine eyes until the sealant failed.\nResults: From high-speed video, the average velocity of the penetrating probe at the point\nof impact was measured to be at 2.73 m/s (n=3). The average kinetic energy at impact\nwas calculated to be 0.26 Joules. Comparative analysis of four commercially-available\nbio-adhesives revealed a wide range of sustainable intraocular pressures upon globe\nre-inflation. The difference between the top performing bio-adhesive, Dermabond®,\nand the three other commercially available bio-adhesive competitors was statistically\nsignificant. The wound that sealed with least effort was a single laceration under\n3mm, while the most difficult wound to seal was a stellate pattern wound ~ 6mm.\nConclusion: This benchtop ocular injury model was utilized to evaluate the temporary sealing of\ndifferent sized and shaped wounds on the cornea. This model was able to accurately\nand consistently create penetrating ocular injuries that could be used to investigate\nthe use of commercially available bio-adhesives as a possible treatment option to\ntemporarily seal these corneal wounds. Data generated from these and future studies\nwill be used to better evaluate the use of various treatment modalities as a temporary\nsealant for penetrating ocular wounds incurred on the battlefield.","title":"FullThickness Penetrating Ocular Injury Model for Use in Evaluating Temporary Battlefield  Treatments","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185325\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Eric Snider, Jorge Acevedo, Peter Edsall, Jeff Rabin, Jeffery Cleland, Brian Lund, David Zamora\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry, U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

To fill this knowledge gap, this study used robust methods to assess the direct\nmedical costs and costs from missed work associated with conjunctivitis. We assessed\ndirect all-cause medical costs (DC) and indirect medically-related absenteeism for\npatients and caregivers (IDC) associated with conjunctivitis in a US population.\nMethods: From Optum Healthcare Solutions data (1998-2016), a database of >19.1 million privately\ninsured patients containing patient demographics, medical and pharmacy claims and\nemployment information, we identified patients with ?1 conjunctivitis diagnosis (cases)\nor without a conjunctivitis diagnosis (controls). Inverse probability treatment weighting\nwas used to minimize the effects of observed confounders and balance both cohorts.\nDC and IDC from 60 days post-conjunctivitis diagnosis (for cases) or an imputed date\n(for controls) were compared using cost differences in linear regressions. Medically-related\nabsenteeism for patients, and caregiver work loss days were imputed based on patients'\nhealthcare resource use (HRU) and their own or caregivers' wages; each weekday ER\nvisit = 1 missed day, each weekday outpatient or other visit = 0.5 missed days.\nResults: We assessed healthcare claims data on a total of 1,002,188 cases and 4,877,210 control\npatients. Both direct and indirect costs were found to be higher for conjunctivitis\npatients: all-cause direct costs were $106.42 [95% CI $104.60, $108.31] per patient\nper month [PPPM] higher; ER visits $15.89 [95% CI $15.63-$16.14] PPPM higher, outpatient\nvisits $63.78 [$62.85-$64.78] PPPM higher, pharmacy $26.32 [$25.90-$26.71] PPPM higher,\n(all P<0.05). Cost of medically-related absenteeism was 2.31 times higher\nfor cases or $105.42 [$104.18-$106.75] PPPM higher, (P=0.0040). Caregiver costs\nrelated to work loss days were 2.47 times higher for cases or $126.22 [95% CI $125.25,\n$127.16] PPPM, (P=0.0040).\nConclusion: These data demonstrate the increased economic burden amongst patients with conjunctivitis\nin terms of HRU and associated direct medical costs and costs of indirect medically-related\nabsenteeism for conjunctivitis patients and their caregivers. When all costs are combined,\nwe find this common condition can lead to a notable economic burden.","title":"A US Claims Analysis of Infectious Conjunctivitis in the General Population Direct  and Indirect Costs","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185326\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Shire\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sujata Sarda, Wendy Cheng, Nora McCormick, Hoi Ching Cheung, Priyanka Bobbili, Mei Sheng Duh, Jay Pepose\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Shire, Analysis Group, Inc., Analysis Group, Inc., Analysis Group, Inc., Analysis Group, Inc., Analysis Group, Inc., Pepose Vision Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

She had complaints of blurred vision with her\nglasses and was told by previous doctors that her prescription was too high to wear\ncontact lenses. She reported that 3 out of 5 of her siblings started losing vision\nin both eyes from high eye pressures during their late 20s and 30s. After a further\nthorough family history, it was noted that her maternal grandmother had high myopia\nand poor vision from unknown etiology. Her visual acuity was 20/20 with -10.00+3.00X119\nrefractive correction in the right eye (OD) and 20/25 with -17.00+3.00X056 refractive\ncorrection in the left eye (OS). Her intraocular pressures (IOP) were 12 mmHg in both\neyes. Slit-lamp biomicrosopy revealed peripheral shallow anterior chamber in both\neyes. Gonioscopy revealed appositional angle closure with 270-300 degrees of peripheral\nanterior synechia with indention. Upon dilation, the edges of the crystalline lens\nand zonules were visible in both eyes (Figure 1). Both optic nerves were tilted but\notherwise had healthy rims. After an evaluation by a glaucoma specialist, the patient\nunderwent bilateral laser gonioplasty/iridotomy. One year after the initial diagnosis\nof microspherophakia, patient's intraocular pressures have been stable with angles\nopen to scleral spur in both eyes and vision is stable with custom toric soft contact\nlenses.\nMicrospherophakia is a rare congenital abnormality of the crystalline\nlens characterized by large anteroposterior diameter and reduced equatorial diameter\nresulting in a spherical lens. The small spherical lens leads to high lenticular myopia,\nlens subluxation, pupillary block and chronic synnechial angle closure from progressive\nanterior shift of the lens.\nConclusion: This case demonstrates the importance of considering the diagnosis of microspherophakia\nin a patient with bilateral high myopia, peripheral anterior synechiae, and small\nspherical crystalline lens.","title":"Management of Bilateral High Myopia and Peripheral Anterior Synechiae Secondary to  Microspherophakia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185317\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Baylor College of Medicine\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Extensive\nareas of both positive and negative fluorescein staining were noted, characteristic\nof epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD) and secondary recurrent corneal erosions\n(RCE), and the patient was started on topical medical treatment for EBMD, including\nhypertonic solutions and artificial tears. Bandage contact lenses were used to treat\nRCE episodes, which occurred roughly once every four months in one or both eyes; topical\nantibiotics were also used at these times as infection prophylaxis. The patient was\ntreated for severe EBMD for over a year, and her vision fluctuated extensively along\nwith epithelial integrity: between 20/40 and 20/200 OD, and between 20/40 and 20/400\nOS. Oral doxycycline was prescribed, and she was referred for epithelial debridement,\nwithout lasting symptomatic success. Upon re-evaluation and consult with a corneal\nspecialist, she was determined to have limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), which accounted\nfor her severely decreased, inconsistent epithelial integrity and concordant fluctuating\nvision, dry eye and pain in both eyes. Management was begun for LCSD, including an\namniotic membrane OS and scleral contact lenses, which improved comfort and vision\n(20/50 OD and 20/100 OS), though the lenses proved untenable for the patient. Ultimately,\nlimbal stem cell graft surgery was recommended as a permanent solution for the patient,\nand she is currently awaiting surgery from a suitable donor while her symptoms are\ntreated palliatively with soft bandage contact lenses.\nConclusion: The diagnosis of limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) should be considered in patients\nwith non-healing or irregular corneal epithelial defects, especially if there is an\nassociated history predisposing the patient to this condition, including toxic insults\nto the cornea, contact lens abuse or ill-fitting contact lenses, and a positive family\nhistory. It may easily be mis-diagnosed as epithelial basemement membrane dystrophy\n(EBMD), due to the overlap of signs and symptoms of the two diseases, though LSCD\nwill not respond to traditional treatments for EBMD. Conservative topical treatment\nand scleral contact lenses have been noted to improve vision and quality of life for\npatients with LSCD, but limbal stem cell graft surgery can provide permanent relief.","title":"Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency Masquerading as Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185318\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sarah Zuckerman, Lloyd Haskes\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry, SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Depending on the etiology, the inflammation can\nbe localized to the anterior, intermediate, or posterior ocular chambers or can be\npresent in all chambers as a panuveitis. Due to the frequency of a lack of symptoms,\npediatric uveitis can be difficult to appropriately diagnose and treat in a timely\nmanner. This may account for the more severe visual sequelae noted in pediatric uveitis\ncompared to adult uveitis. This case explores the clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment\nand management of a pediatric patient with a symptomatic bilateral granulomatous uveitis.\n\nCase Report: A 13 yo AAM presented for an emergency exam with the chief complaint of ocular pain,\nphotophobia, and redness for one month. Pertinent history included a recent dry cough,\nbilateral alternating ankle pain, and intermittent abdomen pain. BCVA was 20/25- OD,\nOS improving to 20/20- OD, OS with pinhole. Pertinent exam findings included a 2+\ndiffuse bulbar conjunctival injection, grade 3+ anterior chamber reaction, and 10-14\nlarge, flat granulomatous keratic precipitates on the endothelium of both eyes. Fundus\nevaluation was unremarkable and no vasculitis or posterior inflammation was noted.\nThe patient was started on topical prednisolone acetate q 1 hour while awake and cyclogyl\nBID OU. Blood work was ordered to rule out systemic infection or inflammation. The\npatient was later switched to durezol QID and was referred to a local uveitis specialist\nfor further management due to poor compliance. Laboratory testing was remarkable for\nelevated beta-2-microglobulin and serum lysozyme leading to suspicion of Tubulointerstitial\nNephritis and Uveitis (TINU). A chest x-ray was performed and was unremarkable.\nConclusion: The differential diagnosis for pediatric uveitis includes juvenile idiopathic arthritis,\nearly onset sarcoidosis, infection such as tuberculosis, tubulointerstitial nephritis\nand uveitis, BLAU syndrome, and idiopathic uveitis. Laboratory testing and imaging\nare needed to appropriately diagnose a patient. Elevated levels of beta-2-microglobulin\ncorrelate with conditions leading to increased cell turnover rates which is common\nin systemic diseases. These diseases include sarcoidosis, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.\nSerum lysozyme is an enzyme that assists in the breakdown of the cell walls of foreign\npathogens. An elevated serum lysozyme can be found in certain leukemias, tuberculosis,\nsarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and in renal disease. Imaging such as chest x-rays\nare important to rule out hilar lymphadenopathy associated with sarcoidosis.

The median of the intrarater KAPPA for ARITA is 0.57, which indicates\na distinct agreement. The values ranged from 0.24 to 0.77. For JENVIS the median is\n0.67 and therefore shows a substantial agreement with values ranging between 0.43\nand 0.85. Furthermore, the intrarater KAPPA was calculated for the upper and lower\neyelid separately. For the upper eyelid (median= 0.59; minimum= 0.22; maximum= 0.86)\nas well as the lower eyelid (median= 0.56; minimum= 0.25; maximum= 0.79) the agreement\nis distinct using the ARITA scale. Whereas the agreement using the JENVIS scale is\nfor both substantial (upper eyelid: median= 0.72; minimum= 0.44; maximum= 0.9 and\nlower eyelid: median= 0.63; minimum= 0.34; maximum= 0.81). The interrater reliability\nwas calculated with the FLEISS' KAPPA and is 0.43 for the ARITA scale and 0.5 for\nthe JENVIS scale. Both demonstrate a distinct agreement. All the specified results\nare significant with a p-value < 0.01.\n[Interpretation of Kappa-Values <\n0 (no agreement), 0- 0.2 (slight), 0.21 -0.4 (fair), 0.41-0.6 (distinct), 0.61-0.8\n(substantial), > 0.8 (almost perfect)]\nConclusion: Both grading scales show an acceptable degree of agreement in interrater as well as\nintrarater reliability. Especially the intrarater reliability can be improved employing\nthe illustrative scale by JENVIS RESEARCH. Illustrative scales may be beneficial to\npractitioners in order to classify meibomian gland dropout.","title":"Comparative Study of Two Grading Scales for the Evaluation of IRMeibography Images  of the Upper and Lower Eyelid in Terms of Intra and Interrater Reliability","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185321\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ernst Abbe University of Applied Sciences\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Julia Wittekind, Sebastian Marx, Wolfgang Sickenberger\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        JENVIS Research, Ernst Abbe University Jena, JENVIS Research, Ernst Abbe University Jena, JENVIS Research, Ernst Abbe University Jena\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether age\nand baseline corneal topography measurements affect epithelial thickness (ET) or total\ncorneal thickness (TCT) changes induced by the CXL procedure.\nMethods: 11 eyes with keratoconus from 11 subjects were imaged with a Scheimpflug topographer\nand a research grade swept-source optical coherence tomographer (SS-OCT) no more than\none month prior to receiving CXL surgery and again one year later. The pre-operative\nthicknesses of the cornea and epithelial layer at the point of minimum total corneal\nthickness were acquired from the SS-OCT images using custom processing software. Regression\nanalysis was performed to determine predictive factors for epithelial and total thickness\nchanges one year after surgery.\nResults: The mean pre-operative corneal ET (54.7 ± 3.3µm) was not significantly different than\nthe ET at the one year follow-up (54.9 ± 2.6µm; p=0.82). Similarly, the average pre-operative\nTCT (464.1 ± 28.8µm) was not significantly different than the same measurement one\nyear later (461.7 ± 30.3µm; p=0.46). Although average thickness values across the\nstudy group showed no change at one year, individual data demonstrated both increases\nand decreases in ET and TCT measurements, with changes up to 10% for ET and up to\n5% for TCT for some participants. Pre-operative ET was significantly correlated with\nchanges in ET (R2=0.43, p=0.029) and TCT (R2=0.37, p=0.048) at one year. Age was significantly\ncorrelated with TCT at one year (R2=0.37, p=0.048), but not ET (R2=0.04, p=0.581).\nOther pre-operative factors such as Flat K, Steep K, maximum keratometry and thinnest\npachymetry measurement were not significantly correlated with changes in ET or TCT\n(p > 0.05 for all).\nConclusion: Mean pre-operative corneal ET and TCT were not significantly different at the one\nyear follow up. Both increases and decreases in individual thickness data were observed\nand these changes were significantly correlated with pre-operative ET. Age was significantly\ncorrelated with TCT changes at one year but not ET. The other pre-operative factors\nstudied were not significantly correlated with corneal thickness values.","title":"Effect of Age and PreOperative Corneal Topography on Epithelial and Total Cornea  Thickness Changes After Corneal Crosslinking Surgery","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185322\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Olivera Kralj, Sebastian Marschall, Ahmed Gawish, Paul Fieguth, Neera Singal, Hall Chew, David Rootman, Allan Slomovic, Wendy Hatch, Kostadinka Bizheva, Luigina Sorbara\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo, Oculus, University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, School of Optometry and Vision Science\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Participants also underwent in vivo corneal confocal\nmicroscopy to quantify corneal nerves, retinopathy and neuropathy assessment, and\nhealth and metabolic assessment. Individuals with diabetes were classified as having\nreduced or normal CST based on the 90\nth\npercentile of the controls. Risk\nfactors for reduced corneal sensitivity were determined using t-tests, and chi-squared\nanalysis.\nResults: 14% (31/216) of the individuals with diabetes had reduced CST (<1.02mB). Compared\nto those with normal CST, individuals with reduced CST had significantly higher triglycerides,\nreduced red cell folate, more likely to be male, and less likely to have a history\nof contact lens wear (all p<0.05). They also had a number of measures indicating\nperipheral neuropathy; reduced cold, warm and vibration perception and nerve conduction\nvelocity in the lower limbs and higher neuropathy disability score (all p<0.05).\nThey were also more likely to report numbness in their legs and feet, and to self-report\nhaving previously been given a diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy (both p<0.05).\nFactors not associated with reduced CST included corneal nerve morphology, HbA\n1c\n,\nduration of diabetes, presence of retinopathy, age, height and weight (all p > 0.05).\nConclusion: The prevalence of reduced corneal sensitivity was relatively low, however, the study\ncohort had mild diabetic complications.

Additionally, we were interested\nin whether any significant differences existed in the access to eye and medical care\nbetween patients being seen in the urgent care clinic and primary care clinic. Patients'\ndemographic factors were obtained, as well as level of insurance coverage for vision\nand medical care, to see if any of these factors were correlated to patients' decision\nto seek care.\nMethods: Surveys were distributed to patients waiting to be seen in the urgent and primary\neye care clinics at the IEI over a 6 day period in June 2017. IRB approval was obtained.\nAll patients over the age of 18 were approached to complete the survey. Informed consent\nwas obtained. The survey included multiple choice questions to assess demographics,\nlevel of insurance coverage for vision and medical exams, time since last eye and\nmedical exams, and known chronic medical and ocular conditions. Data was analyzed\nusing SPSS software.\nResults: Of the 275 patients surveyed, 85.1% were seen in the primary eye care clinic, and\n11.6% were seen in the urgent eye care clinic. The surveyed population was 64.4% female,\nwith a mean age of 52.2 years (18-89 years). Full medical coverage was reported in\n67.6% of patients, while 64% reported having full vision care coverage. Our study\nrevealed that only 1.1% of all patients surveyed do not have vision or medical insurance.\nMost patients had an eye exam within the last two years (86.3%) and a medical exam\nwithin the last year (78.2%). Of the patients surveyed, 40% had known ocular disease\n(most common glaucoma, 15.4%), and 53.5% had chronic medical conditions (most common\ndiabetes, 19.3%).\nA significant correlation was seen between the following\nvariables:\n- Patients presenting to the urgent eye care clinic and patients without\nvision insurance (p=0.009, p<0.01).\n- More recent medical examination and more\nrecent eye examination (p=0.000, p<0.01).\n- Previous ocular disease and systemic\ndisease and more recent eye examination (p=0.000, p<0.01 and p=0.04, p<0.01,\nrespectively).\n- Higher body mass index (BMI) and higher prevalence of systemic\ndisease (p=0.012, <0.05).\n- Increasing age and ocular disease (p=0.000, p<0.01).\nConclusion: A high percentage (86%) of patients surveyed receive adequate eye care in a private\nhealthcare setting.

Conjunctivitis (CONJ) is the most common ocular condition\ndiagnosed in USA ED, accounting for almost one-third of all eye-related encounters,\neven though it is not considered an emergent condition. Successful UCC treatment of\nCONJ could reduce ED burden, a notion that has not, to the best of our knowledge been\naddressed yet. The study aim is description of the demographics and outcomes of a\ncohort presenting to a nationwide system of UCC with CONJ to test whether this condition\ncan be treated in the community.\nMethods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. The setting\nis a nationwide UCC system, which had 17 branches at the time of the study. Anonymous\nElectronic Medical Record (EMR) data (between Nov 1, 2015 and Oct 31, 2016) of patients\ndiagnosed with CONJ or ocular disorder were retrieved from the UCC database and individually\nreviewed to exclude patients with other eye disorders such as foreign body. Extracted\ndata included gender, age, diagnosis, treatment and discharge status. Similar data\nfrom all patients presenting to UCC during the same period served as the control.\nNational data on all ED CONJ patients was collected from a public report of the State\nof Israel Ministry of Health Information Division. Data were analysed by descriptive\nstatistics, Chi-square and Z-proportion test.\nResults: During the study period, 602,074 patients presented to UCCs of which 5045 (0.84%)\nwere identified as having CONJ. The CONJ cohort includes mostly young subjects (41%\nless than 15 years old, while 30.7% were younger than 5 years old). In comparison\nto all UCC patients, CONJ was more prevalent among young males (0-14, p< 0.001)\nand older women (older than 55 p< 0.001). UCC were able to treat and release home\n96.7% of the CONJ cases (with the rest referred to ED). This is significantly higher\nthan the treatment rate for the entire UCC patient cohort (93.2%, p<0.05). Treatment\nincluded in most cases (65.6%) the administration and prescription of ocular antibiotic.\nThe age distribution of patient presenting with CONJ was compared between UCC and\nED. The CONJ cohort at UCC was significantly younger with more patients ages 0-17,\nwhile at ED more patients 18 and older had CONJ (p<0.01).\nConclusion: Most CONJ patients can be treated within UCC thus eliminating the need for costly\nresources when referring to hospital care. However, since cohort at UCC is significantly\nyounger than ED further studies need to be carried out on older patients.","title":"Can Urgent Care Centers Successfully Treat Conjunctivitis in the Community","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185310\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Department of Optometry, Hadassah Academic College\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Deena Zimmerman, Einat Shneor\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        TEREM Emergency Medical Centers, Department of Optometry, Hadassah Academic College\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The first students awarded\nthe O.D. degree graduated in 2013 from Qassim University. Demographic data from the\ntime of the inaugural O.D. graduates has never been studied. The main objective of\nthis study was to present an analysis of the current O.D. workforce and to provide\nuseful information to assist optometry institutions in formulating effective student\nrecruitment strategies. These data may also be used by future employers of O.D. graduates.\nFurther, these unique data may provide insights into the potential impact that optometry\nschools have made on the people of Saudi Arabia.\nMethods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted among the Saudi O.D.s using a structured\nquestionnaire. The databases of KSU and QU alumni were employed, and an electronic\nform was distributed to all O.D.s. The survey included the data on demographics, employment\nstatus and type, primary mode and location of clinical practice, and further factors\naffecting their career.\nResults: One hundred and fifty questionnaires distributed. Ninety-nine O.D.s responded (66%\nresponse rate) to the survey. Of these respondents, 61.6% were males and 30.4% females.\nThe employment rate was higher (72%) among the men compared to women (21%). Of the\n99 O.D.s, 42.5% were employed in Riyadh region, 37.5% were working in Qassim region,\nand the rest were practicing in the other areas in Saudi Arabia. Approximately 58%\nwere employed at the ministry hospitals while 42% were in private clinics. The O.D.s\nworked an average of 38 hours per week. The majority of the O.D.s (74%) in practice\nreceive salaries between $15,500 to $31,000 USD per annum. The professional and job\nsatisfaction was average (5.5 and 4.75 on a scale of 10) among the respondents.\nConclusion: Future studies are needed to further quantify and define the Saudi O.D. growth and\ndevelopment. The Saudi optometry programs will play a key role in this process in\ndevelopment, training, and placement of students. A more considerable effort needs\nto be made to benefit more from O.D.s workforce immediately after graduation throughout\nthe country. Employed O.D.s salary in Saudi Arabia is less compared to other developed\ncountries. Moreover, the reason for the relatively low professional and job satisfaction\nrate need to be studied and addressed, particularly for female O.D.s. These data clearly\nindicate the need for the creation of a Saudi Optometry Workforce Study Group, where\nthese data may be housed, organized and distributed to appropriate industries and\ninstitutions.","title":"The Doctor of Optometry Workforce Analysis in Saudi Arabia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185311\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Qassim University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lama Alsamnan, Swaathi Balaji, Tariq Alharbi, Nawaf Almutairi, Naganathan Muthuramalingam\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Global Eye Care, Nifty Eye Care, Hakeem Eye Care, Pacific University, Nifty Eye Care\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects considered underwent a complete\ncomprehensive visual evaluation followed by a low vision evaluation. Ocular and medical\nhistory were reviewed for each subject. Causes of visual impairment and blindness\nand best corrected visual acuity were recorded. Visual impairment and blindness were\nclassified according to the World Health Organization definitions.\nResults: A total of 179 randomly selected health records of subjects older than 4 years of\nage with visual impairment and blindness were included. The most prevalent cause of\nvisual impairment and blindness was cataracts (17.3%), followed by diabetic retinopathy\n(14.5%), retinitis pigmentosa (12.8%), albinism (11.2%), macular degeneration (10.1%)\nand glaucoma (7.3%).

Despite spectacles being the simplest and\ncost effective method of refractive correction, they do not reach many of the people\nwho have near vision impairment largely due to limited access to primary eye care\nservices and affordable spectacles. This study investigated the change in vision related\nquality of life (VRQoL) following near spectacle correction among textile factory\nworkers using a randomised controlled trial design.\nMethods: We included 270 factory workers who were 40 years or older, worked at least three\nmonths in the factory and would work for at least six more months after the intervention\nin this 6-month trial. Participants were selected from eight textile factories (four\ncontrols: Cr, and four intervention groups: IvG). The VRQoL scores were collected\nat baseline and endline using the National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire-25.\nANOVA tests were used to test the statistical significance of the VRQoL scores between\nIvG and Cr.

Among the fifty states, every state has its own\nvision requirements for initial and renewal of driver's license. Requirements such\nas uncorrected visual acuity, corrected visual acuity and visual fields, can vary\nfrom state to state. The objective of this research is to compare and contrast the\nprevailing vision standards and accepted testing parameters for each state.\nMethods: Information on prevailing driving vision standards were compiled for the 50 United\nStates and the District of Columbia via department of motor vehicle websites of individual\nstates and published literature. Vision requirements pertaining to driving standards\nsuch as minimum uncorrected and corrected visual acuities (binocular and/or monocular),\nvisual fields, color vision, the usage and specifics of bioptic telescopes, and case\nby case restricted licenses were compiled and compared among each state.\nResults: Most states have the same minimum best-corrected visual acuity requirement (BCVA)\nof 20/40 or superior in the better eye. Some states that differ include, Georgia (requires\na BCVA of at least 20/60 in at least one eye), New Jersey (requirement of 20/50 or\nbetter) and Wyoming (BCVA of 20/100 or better). Horizontal visual field requirements\nvary substantially from state to state. Sixteen states have no required visual field\ntesting unless the individual has been referred to an optometrist after failing a\nvisual acuity test or because the visual acuity test was passed using bioptic telescopic\nlenses. Thirty-four states have a binocular horizontal visual field requirement, which\nrange from 105 to 150 degrees. Several states have monocular visual field requirements,\nwhich range from 55 to 105 degrees. However, there are some states, including North\nCarolina and Texas, that will not issue any driver's license to a person with a homonymous\nhemianopia. Kentucky is the only state that requires a horizontal as well as a vertical\nvisual field requirement. Massachusetts is the only state with color vision requirement.\nThe bioptic telescope restrictions also vary state to state. In Mississippi, applicants\nwho fail the eye care specialist's depth perception test are restricted to a maximum\nspeed of 45 mph.\nConclusion: Visual acuity driving standards vary the least between the states. All other visual\nrequirements vary considerably among different states. Though visual acuities and\nvisual fields are important testing aspects for driver's license, optometrists must\ntake into consideration other testing parameters required to assess an individual's\noverall visual driving capabilities.","title":"Vision Requirements for Driving Across the United States What Should Optometrist  Know","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185315\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Danielle Zapata, Nicholas Pike, Shankaran Ramaswamy\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry, School of Optometry, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This information is imperative due\nto vision's impact on occupational performance, a cornerstone of occupational therapy.\nThe aim of this study, therefore, was to identify concussion-related vision disorder\npractice patterns of occupational therapists across various settings.\nMethods: A 41-item survey was administered to occupational therapists from 46 states via Survey\nMonkey about how they screen, refer, and treat concussion-related vision disorders.\nQuantitative data analysis was mostly descriptive in nature. Qualitative data analysis\nincluded the creation of metadata, including both codes and concept maps.\nResults: Of the 23, 910 surveys that were emailed, 2,278 (10%) therapists participated, and\n1,187 (52%) completed the survey. Twenty-nine percent reported that they attended\ncontinuing education courses in concussion rehabilitation, and 57% courses in vision.\nTwenty-nine percent reported screening for concussion-related vision disorders during\ntheir evaluation, and the following areas were screened always or frequently: visual\nacuity (71%), visual information processing (44%), convergence (43%), saccades (31%),\nand accommodation (8%). The most helpful professional to diagnose concussion-related\nvision disorders was identified as neurologists (48%), ophthalmologists (30%), and\noptometrists (11%). Of the therapists who reported treating concussion-related vision\ndisorders, the most common treatments were for visual perception (14%), pursuits (12%),\nand saccades (10%). About 6% reported using prism and lenses in their treatment. Only\n17% had an optometrist within their facility to examine patients suspected of having\nconcussion-related vision disorders, and 7% had an optometrist who worked with occupational\ntherapy to provide vision therapy. For those without an optometrist onsite, optometry\nservices were located within 20 miles for 56% of respondents.\nConclusion: Occupational therapists appear to be involved in screening and managing concussion-related\nvision disorders. There appears to be a lack of knowledge about the role of optometry\nin the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions, and a lack of understanding that\nthere are differences within the profession of optometry in regard to the likelihood\nof a comprehensive examination being performed.

The majority of these patients are young females in their\nmid-thirties with symptoms of photopsia. Pathogenesis is unknown however theories\nrevolve around autoimmune/inflammatory diseases and viral infection. Patients with\nthis condition typically presents with minimal to no fundus changes making it hard\nto diagnose with exam only. ERG testing will show reduced PR cell response and OCT\ncan portray degeneration of the outer nuclear layer. A wide variety of visual field\ndefects may be seen.

She has an ocular history of high myopia S/P LASIK OU. Patient has an unremarkable\nmedical history and is not on any systemic medications with NKDA. Her vision is OD:\n20/30 OS: 20/20 with normal IOP and unremarkable findings on anterior and posterior\nfundus exam. The long-lasting symptoms of flashes and floaters led to more in depth\ntesting.

The quality of vision varies from 0/10 to\n7/10. He states that he has unexplained vision loss OS since age 20, for which he\nsees a retinal specialist. He also has optic nerve drusen which he says is unrelated\nto the visual field loss.\nHis medical history included hypertension and gout.\nEntering acuities with multifocal contacts were OD: 20/15-1 and OS: 20/25-2 at distance\nand OD: 20/25 and OS 20/20 at near. He had a 2+ APD OS and dense inferior constriction\nOS on confrontation visual field testing (to horizontal midline). His refraction OD\nwas stable, but -0.75 D was added to the distance Rx OS, with 20/20 acuity achieved\nat distance and near. The anterior segment was unremarkable. IOP was 13 mmHg OD and\n16 mmHg OS. The posterior segment revealed the absence of cup on the optic disc, with\nobvious disc drusen OS>>OD, particularly superiorly. The retina had 2 distinct\nareas of pigment changes with mild atrophy both OD and OS and a mild epiretinal membrane\njust nasal to the fovea OS. Fundus autofluorescence confirmed the presence of significant\noptic disc drusen OS, with some present OD as well. RNFL OCT indicated severe RNFL\nloss superior OS, with significant damage inferior OD and OS. Macular OCT showed mild\nfocal outer retinal disruption in the atrophic areas viewed funduscopically, including\nmild fluid near the optic disc OS.\nFurther questioning revealed that the\npatient had had a laser procedure performed on his retina. He also found a note that\nstated that he was told that photodynamic therapy was an option, though he does not\nrecall if he received the treatment. Attempts to obtain records from the retina specialist\nhave so far proved unsuccessful.\nThe patient was educated that his apparent\ninferior altitudinal defect OS was indeed from the optic disc drusen and that the\nretinal laser and photodynamic therapy were for central serous chorioretinopathy.\nHis transient vision problems OS likely had to do with split fixation visual field\nloss, despite 20/20 acuity in office, possibly being task-dependent. The ERM was not\nsuspected to contribute to his symptoms. Even though the vision loss was longstanding,\nwe recommended formal visual field testing with consideration of ocular hypotensive\ntreatment to minimize future vision loss to that eye.\nConclusion: There is no known association between optic disc drusen and central serous chorioretinopathy\nwith only one case report having linked the two. It is unknown if this patient's conditions\nwere linked or merely co-existent. Effective patient education and directed history\nwas shown to be of benefit in a patient with multiple conditions.","title":"Optic Disc Drusen with Concurrent Central Serous Chorioretinopathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185298\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The total number of hours spent studying was\nnot significantly related to GPA, but was significantly positively correlated with\nthe Grit score (p=0.001). The odds of passing boards or the boards scores were not\nsignificantly related to any of the following of our study variables: mean amount\nof study time per week, longitudinally increased weekly study time, proportion of\ntime studying KMK, Optoprep or class notes, or proportion of time spent studying individually\n(all p > 0.05).\nConclusion: Based on our study, GPA was the only significant variable associated with NBEO outcome.\nFuture studies should attempt to enroll a larger proportion of the class in order\nto minimize the potential for selection bias.","title":"An Evaluation of Factors Related to Success on the NBEO Part 1 Exam Among NSU Optometry  Students","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185300\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        NOVA Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ava Bittner, Amanda Reyes, Nicole Patterson, Michael Bacigalupi\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        NOVA Southeastern University College of Optometry, NOVA Southeastern University College of Optometry, Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry, NOVA Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This skill is vital for diagnostic\npurposes and certain surgical procedures, and typically a student doctor must go through\nextensive training investing many hours of practice on real human patients. With the\nadvancements of technology, Eyesi Indirect Ophthalmoscope (BIO) simulators have introduced\nan alternative to real patients for practice, therefore, may help interns in learning\nthis difficult clinical skill. The purpose of this retrospective quantitative approach\nis to investigate the relationship between the amount of time interns spent utilizing\nBIO simulators as an additional learning tool for practicing purposes, and their BIO\nclinical performance grades among two different groups of second year interns at a\nprivate optometry school in Texas.\nMethods: Two different groups of second year interns were statistically compared. The comparison\nconsisted of two different groups of interns from Fall of 2016 (n=56) and Fall of\n2017 (n=61). Both groups used the traditional method which involved using real practice\npatients, but also utilized the Eyesi Indirect Ophthalmoscopy Simulator as an additional\nlearning tool to help them practice and improve their clinical BIO skills. Interns\nwere given an entire semester to practice and were instructed to complete a minimum\nnumber of modules including all of the modules contained in sections A1, A3, A5, A6\nand A7 of the simulator without any due regards to time or number of attempts. Their\nmastery of this challenging skill during a semester was assessed based on the interns\ngrades on a BIO checkout, and a final clinical proficiency. Each groups' grades were\nevaluated to investigate whether there is a relationship between the amount of time\nsimulators were utilized by each intern, and the interns' clinical performance grades.\nResults: The study showed that there was no statistical significant correlation between the\namount of simulator utilization time, and interns' clinical performance grades on\nthe BIO checkout and the final clinical proficiency grades in both groups.\nConclusion: Further research needs to be done in order to investigate the possibility to maximize\nthe benefits of BIO simulators as a supplementary teaching tool. While accuracy and\nproficiency are critical aspects of the BIO training process, however, efficiency\nis also another important factor that needs to be taken into account. Perhaps with\ntime optimization, the learning experience can be modified to have the simulators\nnot only help improve skill accuracy, but also improve BIO efficiency, therefore,\nenabling educators to better prepare interns for real life patient encounters.","title":"The Effect of BIO Simulator Time Utilization on Clinical Interns Performance","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185301\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Noah Kasraie\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Individual responses were categorized as \"internal risk factor,\" such as\ncomorbidities, or \"external risk factor\" such as poverty. Student t test for independent\nsamples was used to compare mean number of external and internal risk factors listed\nbetween class year and between genders.\nResults: The total group of students elicited 14 separate external risk factors and 21 separate\ninternal risk factors. No significant difference in the mean number of total risk\nfactors listed was found between class years (p = 0.73) or between genders (p= .29).\nMean number of external risk factors identified (CL2018 3.1 ± 1.3; CL2019 1.7 ± 1.0,\np = .026) and mean number of internal risk factors identified (CL2018 2.6 ± 2.2; CL2019\n4.3 ± 1.6, p = .0024) differed significantly between classes.\nMean number of external\nrisk factors identified (males 3.2 ± 1.4 ; females 2.1± 1.3, p = .026) and mean number\nof internal risk factors identified (males 2.2 ± 1.8; females 4.3 ± 2.2, p = .01)\ndiffered significantly between genders.

This study compared VR to cadavers in helping students learn anatomy\nin optometry school and measured student preferences for the two learning tools.\nMethods: Subjects were optometry students (n=49, 29 females, 20 males, mean age = 24.2±2.2\nyears old) from the Kentucky College of Optometry who had completed one full year\nof anatomy courses. Subjects were surveyed regarding the learning tools used for each\nanatomy course taken. Students rated each tool in four categories (Understanding of\nSpatial Relationships of Anatomical Components, Understanding of Functional Relationships\nof Anatomical Components, Understanding of Clinical Relevance of Anatomical Components,\nand Overall Experience Learning Anatomy). The survey used a Likert Scale with \"Hindered\nMy Learning-1\", \"No Difference-2\", \"Helpful-3\", and \"Very Helpful-4\".

The current clinical exposure to ABI is insufficient\nfor students to achieve adequate comfort in managing this growing population. To address\nthis shortcoming, an addendum to the curriculum in the form of an online continuing\neducation program was delivered in a flipped classroom format combined with an intensive\none-day workshop that included hands-on patient interaction. The purpose of this study\nwas to evaluate the impact of this workshop on student satisfaction and comfort in\nmanaging patients with ABI.\nMethods: Pre- and post-workshop surveys were administered. These surveyed the students' current\nlevel of experience managing ABI patients, their understanding of the visual consequences\nof ABI, their comfort in assessing ABI visual dysfunction, and their comfort in developing\nand implementing rehabilitation plans. Comfort was assessed using a Likert scale (Very\nComfortable = 2, Somewhat Comfortable = 1, Neither Comfortable nor Uncomfortable =\n0, Uncomfortable = -1, Very Uncomfortable = -2). This study was conducted in accordance\nwith the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and received ethics clearance through\na University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee.\nResults: 19 students (20% of the 2017-2018 3rd year class) participated in this non-mandatory\nworkshop. Prior to taking the workshop, all students reported having experience with\n0-2 ABI patients. On average students felt Uncomfortable (-0.81 ± 0.97) with all aspects\nof ABI rehabilitation prior to the workshop. Upon completion, students reported feeling\nSomewhat Comfortable (1.1 ± 0.86) with ABI rehabilitation overall, and student comfort\non all of the individual components of the survey increased significantly (p<0.05).\nThe increased satisfaction scores were supported by positive feedback comments provided\nby the students.\nConclusion: Based on the pre- and post-workshop surveys, student satisfaction and comfort with\nmanaging patients with ABI improved significantly. This method of teaching ABI rehabilitation\ntherefore appears to be effective as delivered.

The patient reported no pain, irritation, redness, or photosensitivity.\nEntering visual acuities were hand motion OD and 20/50+ OS. At his exam earlier in\nthe day with the retinal specialist, his vision was 20/40- OD and OS prior to the\nintravitreal injection. His pupils were pharmacologically dilated. Slit lamp exam\nOD revealed a subconjunctival hemorrhage on the bulbar conjunctiva at the injection\nsite. There was significant superficial corneal haze with minimal corneal stromal\nedema and diffuse nongranulomatous keratic precipitates (KPs). Views of the anterior\nchamber were limited, although moderate cells and flare were observed without hypopyon.\nA posterior chamber intraocular lens could be appreciated, but there were no views\nposterior to that. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 42mmHg OD. One drop of dorzolamide\n2%/timolol 0.5% was instilled, which lowered the IOP to 30mmHg OD. Over the next 2\nhours, the cornea cleared slightly, allowing views of the vitreous where vitritis\nwas appreciated and vision slowly improved to 20/150. The optic nerve head and retina\nwere unable to be appreciated due to the media opacities. Optical coherence tomography\nscans indicated the retina and optic nerve head were not edematous. The patient was\ntreated with prednisolone acetate 1% every hour and dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% bid\nOD. By his 1-week follow-up, vision OD returned to baseline and IOP was 15mmHg. Slit\nlamp exam showed mild cells and flare with resolved KPs and vitreal cells.\nConclusion: The inflammation was presumed to be sterile in this case as the intraocular contents\nwere not cultured, the onset of presentation was acute, and the inflammation was resolving\non topical steroids without the use of antibiotics.

His best-corrected\nvisual acuity was 20/50- OD with symptoms of metamorphopsia and reduced vision. The\npatient underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM)\npeeling. The PPV was performed using the Advanced Visual Instruments contact lens\nwide angle viewing system. Eckhart type ILM forceps were used to peel the membrane\nand ILM over the macula. One day post-operatively, an eccentric macular hole (MH)\nwas noted temporal to the fovea without retinal detachment. The patient underwent\npneumatic retinopexy without complication in an attempt to close the hole. Three days\npost-operatively, without closure of the eccentric MH, the patient underwent laser\nretinopexy. Nine months post-operatively, the patient reported improvement in metamorphopsia\nand vision without any complications. Best-corrected visual acuity at the 9-month\npost-operative visit was 20/40- OD. Spectralis spectral-domain optical coherence tomography\n(Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) confirmed the eccentric MH temporal\nto the fovea with laser barricade surrounding the hole and no signs of retinal detachment.\nConclusion: Eccentric macular hole has been reported as a rare complication post-operatively after\nPPV with or without ILM peeling. Proposed pathogenesis of eccentric MH formation includes\nintraoperative iatrogenic trauma secondary to the ILM peeling or the ERM removal and\npossibly the toxic effect of the dyes used during the surgery. Internal limiting membrane\npeeling can result in nerve fiber layer and Mueller cell damage or glial apoptosis.\nThis can lead to weakening of the glial structure leading to the formation of the\nMH. Abnormal retinal traction due to the firm perifoveal adhesions of the hyaloid\nmembrane during the ERM removal has also been proposed to be a possible cause; especially\nin cases without ILM peeling. Most cases of eccentric MH do not require treatment\nand have been reported to be stable for years. However, in our case the retinal surgeon\ndecided to treat the eccentric MH, given its proximity to the fovea, with laser retinopexy\nafter pneumatic retinopexy failed to close the MH. Our case is also unique in that\nthe patient developed the eccentric MH just 1 day post-operatively. Cases in the literature\nhave reported that eccentric macular holes develop days to months after the ERM surgery.\nEccentric MH should be considered as a potential complication after PPV with and without\nILM peeling.","title":"Eccentric Macular Hole as an Early Complication of Pars Plana Vitrectomy for Epiretinal  Membrane","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185296\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA Palo Alto Healthcare System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        David Yang, Michael Wallerich\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Veterans Affairs Palo Alto, VA Palo Alto Healthcare System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Clinically, lesions\nare characterized as sub-retinal whitish-yellow masses. Typically, the lesions are\nidiopathic; however, sclerochoroidal calcification may result from underlying systemic\nconditions including abnormal calcium-phosphorus metabolism, renal hypokalemic syndromes\nand hypovitaminosis D. The elevated lesion may demonstrate similar clinical characteristics\nto suspicious choroidal neoplasms; therefore, accurate differential diagnosis of benign\nsclerochoroidal calcification versus malignant choroidal neoplasms is critical to\nfacilitate appropriate and timely treatment and management.

There was a strong and positive correlation between\nMPOD measured using dual-wavelength AF at four central eccentricities and MPOD volume\nand LF (r=0.60 for MPOD Volume at 6.02° eccentricity, p = 0.002; r=0.46 for MPOD at\n0.23°, p = 0.01; r=0.50 for MPOD at 0.51°, p = 0.01; r=0.50 for MPOD at 0.74°, p =\n0.008; r=0.50 for MPOD at 1.02°, p = 0.008; partial correlations controlling for possible\nconfounders of MPOD including body mass index, age and dietary intake of lutein and\nzeaxanthin).\nConclusion: CONCLUSION\nThe positive relationship between LF and MPOD observed herein\nis possibly explained by a simple physiological mechanism whereby MPOD, which is a\nfunction of dietary carotenoid intake, is positively related to lutein and zeaxanthin\nconcentration in the crystalline lens. Higher lens lutein and zeaxanthin concentration\nis likely to influence the LF measurement which is computed as a ratio of fluorescent\nto scattered light. Lutein and zeaxanthin preferentially absorb the 465nm wavelength\nemitted by the Clearpath device. Higher tissue concentrations will, therefore, reduce\nthe measured blue light scatter in the lens, leading to a higher LF ratio measurement.\nA study designed to assess the impact of lens fluorescence on MPOD measured using\ndual-wavelength AF before and after cataract surgery is required to determine the\npotential value of a LF based correction factor for MPOD measurements.","title":"The Relationship Between Lens Fluorescence and Macular Pigment Measured Using DualWavelength  Autofluorescence","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185290\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Research Ireland\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ian Flitcroft, John Butler, Colm O'brien, Nabin Paudel, James Loughman\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Research Ireland, Centre for Eye Research Ireland, Mater Hospital, Centre for Eye Research Ireland, Centre for Eye Research Ireland\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

PRVLs are seldom associated with pathological\nchanges but rare cases of hemorrhage and occlusion have been reported in the literature.\n\nCase Report: Case 1 is an 11 yo F referred for evaluation of a preretinal hemorrhage OD. BCVA was\n20/20 OU. DFE revealed bilateral PRVs. OCT imaging visualized the PRVs as discrete\nhyper-reflective structures originating from the nasal aspect of the optic nerve head\nextending into the vitreous cavity. A hyporeflective core, corresponding to the vascular\nlumen, was noted on several OCT b-scans of the left eye. No hemorrhaging was appreciated.\nDue to its length and oblique orientation, a single OCT b-scan could not accurately\ndepict the whole PRVL in either eye. The PRVLs created a shadowing effect which diminished\nvisualization of tissue posterior to the PRVL. This shadowing effect created a \"gap\"\nin the OCT b-scan of the optic nerve head similar to findings in OCT images of optic\nnerve pits. There was complete shadowing of portions of the peripapillary region in\nthe left eye where no retina was visualized.\nCase 2 is a 36 yo F referred\nfor evaluation of anomalous papillary vasculature OS. BCVA was 20/20 OU and examination\nrevealed a PRVL OS. Similar to case 1, the PRVL was visualized as a hyper-reflective\nstructure with a hypo-reflective core on several OCT b-scans. The PRVL extended into\nthe vitreous cavity, creating a shadowing effect similar to Case 1.\nCase\n3 is a 61 yo M referred for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy OU and a vitreous hemorrhage\nOD. BCVA was 20/40 OU secondary to cataracts. Examination revealed mild NPDR OU and\na PRVL OD. Similar to cases 1 and 2, OCT imaging revealed a hyper-reflective structure\noriginating from the nasal aspect of the optic nerve head extending into the vitreous.\nNo vitreous hemorrhaging was appreciated.\nConclusion: PRVLs are rare congenital vascular anomalies that may mimic serious vascular lesions.\nOCT can help differentiate PRVLs from other lesions. OCT images PRVLs as hyper-reflective\nstructures extending from the optic nerve into the vitreous. A hypo-reflective core\ncorresponding to the vascular lumen can sometimes be visualized. Due to their 3D structure,\nPRVLs are difficult to render with a single OCT b-scan and create a shadowing effect.\nPRV shadowing of the retina can lead to complete loss of retinal tissue visualization\nwhile PVR shadowing of the optic nerve head can mimic an optic pit. Eye care providers\nmust be aware of both pathological and non-pathological findings, as they are visualized\nwith OCT, to prevent inaccurate diagnoses and superfluous referrals.","title":"OCT Findings in Preretinal Vascular Loops PRVLsbr","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185291\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this work was to evaluate optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal\nstructures (including foveal structure and cone photoreceptors) in identical twins\nto assess their degree of similarity between twins.\nMethods: One set of identical twins, age 13, was evaluated, and parameters were compared to\n10 age matched unrelated subjects. Following visual acuity, the right eyes of each\nsubject were dilated for refraction (Grand- Seiko) and biometry (Lenstar). Retinal\nimaging was performed with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT; Heidelberg\nSpectralis); scan parameters included 12° circular and 48 line 20° radial scans with\nenhanced depth imaging centered at the ONH. The macula was imaged (20° x 20° volume\nscan, 97 B-scans) for foveal pit and thickness assessment. Split detector and confocal\nadaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope images of foveal capillaries and cone\nphotoreceptors were acquired to quantify foveal avascular zone metrics and cone packing.\nImages were scaled and analyzed with custom Matlab programs.\nResults: Spherical equivalent refractions were within 0.3 D between twins. Biometric measures\nwere also similar (axial length: 23.22 vs 23.05 mm; anterior chamber depth: 4.12 vs\n3.98mm; lens thickness: 3.37 vs 3.36 mm). Mean minimum rim widths were 214 µm vs 177\nµm and Bruch's membrane opening diameters were 2.18 µm vs 2.17 µm. Cup to disc ratios\nwere H: 0.74 vs 0.8 and V: 0.62 vs 0.68. Lamina cribrosa depths were 413.11 µm vs\n467.96 µm. Nerve fiber layer thicknesses were 97 µm vs 94 µm. Choroidal thicknesses\nwere also similar (193 µm vs 189 µm). The difference in foveal thickness between twins\nwas 3 µm. Foveal pit depth was 112 µm vs 121 µm. Foveal pit diameters were 2.09 mm\nvs 1.91 mm. There were small differences in area and perimeter of the foveal avascular\nzone between the twins (area: 0.165 mm\n2\nvs 0.180 mm\n2\n, perimeter:\n1.808 mm vs 2.094 mm). Bound cone densities at 0.2 mm eccentricity were 55,633 cones/mm\n2\nvs 57,763 cones/mm\n2\n, and cone nearest neighbor spacings were 3.74 µm vs\n3.68 µm. All SD-OCT derived values except for minimum rim width, lamina cribrosa depth\nand cup disc ratios were within the 95% confidence intervals of the age matched controls.\nLamina cribrosa depth and cup disc ratio, although outside the 95% confidence interval,\nwere similar between twins.\nConclusion: These results demonstrate that refractive, biometric and retinal features including\noptic nerve head, foveal pit parameters, foveal avascular zone and cone packing are\nsimilar between the identical twins examined here. These findings are in agreement\nwith the previous studies demonstrating heritability of retinal traits in healthy\neyes.","title":"Retinal and Optic Nerve Head Imaging in Young Identical Twins","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185292\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Hanieh Mirhajianmoghadam, Gwen Musial, Jason Porter, Lisa Ostrin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, University of Houston, University of Houston, University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Patients may experience\nnyctalopia in their teenage, with progressively constricted visual field (VF) over\nthe time. Central vision is usually unaffected until late stage (around 60 years old\nor above). Absence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choriocapillaris with arterial\nattenuation and optic atrophy may appear in advanced stage. This poster will cover\nthe clinical presentations, etiologies, differential diagnosis, managements and potential\ntreatments of choroideremia. A case report with fundus photos and clinical findings\nof full- field electroretinogram (ERG), static and kinetic VF tests, optical coherence\ntomography (OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), autofluorescence\n(AF), multicolor OCT imaging, fluorescein angiography (FA) and genetic test results\nin a young Chinese male will be used for illustration. This patient had been followed\nup for 2 years and the visual function (in terms of ERG and VF) was found to be significantly\ndeteriorated.\n\nCase Report: Case details: An \"˜asymptomatic' young male (20 years old) was found to have\nbilateral choroidal and RPE atrophy with dispersed peripheral patchy retinal pigment\nclumps. VF tests showed that the field extent was severely constricted in both eyes.\nERG revealed that the rod cells response was greatly reduced, and the cone cells response\nwas also abnormal. After repeated interrogation, he mentioned about his difficulties\nunder dark environment. Genetic testing on CHM gene confirmed the diagnosis of X-\nlinked choroideremia. Genetic counselling was provided to his family members to offer\nbetter understanding towards this disease and to have a better family planning in\nthe future. His mum was found to have the same disease with less severity, while his\nelder brother was unaffected. Two years later, repeated functional assessment on VF\nand ERG were done and enormously deterioration was found when compared to the baseline.\nLow vision rehabilitation and low vision aids were introduced to improve the quality\nof life. The prognosis of choroideremia is poor and there is no specific treatment\navailable in this stage. Fortunately, gene therapy for choroideremia has been reported\nwhich may bring some encouraging news to patients who are suffering from this disease.\nConclusion: Conclusion: Choroideremia is a rare disease and its clinical presentation may\nbe difficult to distinguish from retinitis pigmentosa and gyrate atrophy. Careful\nand comprehensive history taking and clinical examination are essential to make the\naccurate diagnosis. Regular follow-up on visual function is important and low vision\nrehabilitation should be initiated whenever appropriate.

The patient had previous episcleritis\nepisodes secondary to underlying psoriatic arthritis. She had no other ocular or medical\nhistory. Visual acuities were 20/20-2 OD and 20/20-1 OS uncorrected with a positive\nrelative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Confrontation visual fields showed\na defect in the superior field of the right eye that spared central vision. Upon dilated\nfundus exam, a BRAO with an associated embolus was discovered in the inferior temporal\nartery of the right eye. The patient was sent to emergency services for a full neurological\nand cardiovascular work-up. Upon further investigation by cardiology, the patient\nwas diagnosed with patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient was started on antiplatelet\nmedications and scheduled for surgical repair.\nConclusion: There are very few case studies about the correlation between BRAO and PFO, but those\navailable indicate the importance of considering PFO as a differential diagnosis in\npatients younger than the average age for BRAO. PFO is not uncommon in the general\npopulation, but complications due to PFO can be rare. Performing the proper referral\nfor cardiovascular consultation could help prevent additional embolic events for patients\nwith PFO.","title":"Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion in a Patient with Patent Foramen Ovale","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185280\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jennifer Deakins, Jenny Terrell, Andrew Kemp\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, University of the Incarnate Word, University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Although\noften an isolated finding, nanophthalmos has been described in patients with concurrent\nretinitis pigmentosa as well as in several syndromes. In 1999, a single case study\nreported the association of nanophthalmos, optic drusen and retinitis pigmentosa in\nthe same patient. Subsequently, these same three findings along with foveoschisis\nwere reported as a syndrome linked by an autosomal recessive MFRP gene mutation. This\ncase report details a patient with known nanophthalmos in whom the other portions\nof the syndrome were not detected until early adulthood.\n\nCase Report: A patient with nanophthalmos was previously followed until early adulthood for the\ntreatment of bilateral high hyperopia (+15.00 D OU), alternating esotropia and bilateral\namblyopia. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OU and was stable compared to previous\nexams. During a routine follow up including gas permeable contact lens care, a dilated\nfundus exam revealed several previously unrecognized findings. The patient was found\nto have optic nerve drusen OS>OD confirmed by both B scan and autofluoresence.\nBilateral foveoschisis was documented by OCT with central thicknesses of 667 OD and\n725 OS. Associated cystoid macula edema was demonstrated in both eyes on fluorescein\nangiography. Bilateral peripheral retinal pigment clumping was consistent with retinitis\npigmentosa. Goldmann visual fields were constricted in both eyes to the smaller isopters.\nOn further questioning, the patient reported a long history of difficulty with night\nvision. No family history of any component of this syndrome was reported. The macular\nedema was intially treated with prednisolone and ketorolac OU QID with no improvement.\nShe was subsequently switched to brinzolamide OU TID with only slight improvement\nin OCT thickness after 3 months of treatment. Genetic testing is pending. The patient\nhas received low vision care for many years prior to these findings.\nConclusion: This case documents an isolated, sporadic case of a rare syndrome consisting of nanophthalmos,\noptic disc drusen, foveoschisis and retinitis pigmentosa that has been previously\nreported in the literature but was unknown to the patient. This abstract contributes\nto the few reported cases of this syndrome in the literature. Practitioners who examine\npatients with nanophthalmos as a primary finding should consider periodic testing\nfor the other components of the syndrome, all of which may become more apparent with\nthe passing of time.","title":"A Rare Syndrome of Nanophthalmos Optic Disc Drusen Foveoschisis and Retinitis Pigmentosa","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185281\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Loyola University Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Veena Raiji\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Loyola University Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Sarah Zuckerman","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/the-role-of-multimodal-imaging-in-the-diagnosis-of-retinoschisis-vs-retinal-detachment","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Accurately differentiating a retinal detachment (RD) and retinoschisis (RS) is crucial\nas treatment and management of these conditions differ drastically. If a RS has no\ninner or outer layer holes, the patient can be followed less often than a sight threatening\nRD where timely surgical intervention is necessary. RS and RD occur in different locations\nin the retinal layers. Typically, RS is bilateral and inferior temporal. Binocular\nindirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression and imaging such as ultrasound B,\nvisual field and optical coherence tomography are used to aid in diagnosis. In atypical\ncases, a combination of Optos\nR\nimaging with diagnostic argon laser retinopexy\ncan be used to help differentiate RS from RD.\n\nCase Report: Two patients presented to our clinic with asymptomatic, atypical presentations of\nsuspected RS during routine exams. Both patients presented with areas of retinal elevation\nunilaterally and superior temporally in the left eye. In both cases, Optos\nR\nimaging revealed choroidal detail and ultrasound-B scan showed minimal to no mobility\nof the lesion. From this point these patients were managed differently. One patient\nwas referred to a retinal specialist who confirmed the RS and also noted a very small,\nshallow area of schisis in the fellow eye. The bilaterality further supported the\ndiagnosis of RS. Dilating the patient quarterly over the past year, noting no progression,\ninner or outer holes, has further confirmed the diagnosis. The second patient underwent\nOCT imaging which confirmed a split between the outer plexiform and inner nuclear\nlayers. Given the size of the lesion and history of trauma, he was referred to our\nretina clinic for further consultation. At this visit, visual field testing resulted\nin a corresponding absolute defect. Possible progression of the RS and questionable\nareas of dialysis were noted, so diagnostic retinopexy was performed, which supported\nthe diagnosis of RS.\nConclusion: Although more radical, in cases of atypically located retinal elevation with confounding\nimaging results, utilizing diagnostic retinopexy to differentiate RS from RD may be\nneeded. In RS, application of the laser will cause \"blanching,\" which does not typically\noccur in RD. Blanching is a result of the uptake of laser energy that occurs when\nthe photoreceptors are attached to the RPE. Preventative treatment for the low likelihood\nof progressive RS is not currently recommended. However, laser treatment can be useful\nif outer holes within the area of schisis occur. If the retinopexy suggests that the\ncondition is a RD, treatment can be initiated at the time of diagnosis. Time will\nhelp confirm the diagnosis of RS, but in riskier cases, retinopexy can help clinicians\narrive at a treatment plan quickly. As the scope of optometry advances, it is increasingly\nimportant to understand all indications for laser use, not only for treatment, but\ndiagnosis as well.","title":"The Role of MultiModal Imaging in the Diagnosis of Retinoschisis vs Retinal Detachment","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185282\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Danielle Iacono, Kimberley Poirier-Schmidt\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry, SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The detectable\nextravascular flow signal on OCTA in diabetic macular edema is produced due to Brownian\nmotion of lipid particles suspended in intraretinal fluid. Commercially available\nOCTA systems differ in their decorrelation algorithms and thresholds of detection\nof motion in order to maximize \"true flow\" and minimize artifacts. Suspended lipid\nparticles move at a slower speed than moving erythrocytes in retinal vasculature and\nas such, may be thresholded out during image processing. We will show that these differences\nbetween systems can result in variation of appearance of qualitative findings on OCTA,\nwhich pose challenges to clinical interpretation.\n\nCase Report: Structural OCT scans and en face OCTA images centered at the fovea were reviewed in\nsix eyes of three patients aged 50 to 74 with clinical diagnosis of diabetic macular\nedema with a commercially available spectral-domain OCT system (AngioPlex-Zeiss Meditec,\nInc, Dublin, CA, USA, or AngioVue-OptoVue, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA). OCTA en face images\nwere analyzed to identify the presence of increased extravascular flow signal and\nthe corresponding B-scans were evaluated to identify intraretinal fluid consistent\nwith diabetic macular edema. Four of four eyes of two patients imaged with the AngioPlex\ndevice had detectable flow signal not associated with retinal vasculature consistent\nwith SSPiM. Zero of two eyes of one patient imaged on the AngioVue device had detectable\nextravascular flow signal consistent with SSPiM.\nConclusion: Differences in thresholding and decorrelation algorithms between OCTA devices can\nresult in clinical challenges in qualitative interpretation of images. Variation in\nproprietary algorithms optimize certain features of scans which ultimately aim to\nexclude noise and maximize detection of \"true flow\". As device-specific decorrelation\nand thresholding algorithms are not adjustable and their specifics are not known to\nthe clinician, qualitative interpretation of data can be challenging.","title":"Impact of Thresholding and Decorrelation Algorithms on Detection of Suspended Scattering  Particles in Motion on OCT Angiography in Diabetic Macular Edema","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185285\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University, College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

When atypical visual\nfields do not correlate with a suspicion for glaucoma, it is wise to take a closer\nlook at the retina. Diagnostic imaging such as fundus autofluorescence may catch early\nor subtle retinal changes in conditions such as AZOOR.\n\nCase Report: A healthy 16-year-old African-American female presented to her local eye doctor for\nroutine eye exam, when a unilateral visual field defect was uncovered via confrontation\nvisual fields. With cup-to-disc enlargement and a family history of glaucoma, a glaucoma\nwork-up was started. After six months of follow-up and repeatable visual field defects\nthat did not correlate with glaucoma, she was referred to a medical center for consultation.\nOn\ninitial consult exam, she endorsed occasional photopsias and inferior-temporal scotoma\nin the left eye for six months. She also reported sporadic radiating pain along the\nleft side of her neck and forehead since suffering from strep throat at the onset\nof this period. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye with normal\ncolor vision, stereopsis, extraocular motilities, and pupils. Slit lamp exam was unremarkable\nwith normal intraocular pressure. Subtle retinal pigment changes were noted on funduscopy\nwith normal optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer in\nboth eyes. Ganglion cell complex was normal in the right eye but showed superonasal\nthinning in the peripapillary region of the left eye. Macula OCT found localized photoreceptor\nloss in the corresponding juxtapapillary region of the left eye. The corresponding\nphotoreceptors of the right eye were normal, including the outer nuclear layer and\nellipsoid zone.\nWith non-specific headaches, atypical visual fields, and\nsubtle retinopathy, the patient was referred to retina and neurology for further evaluation.\nRetina imaging revealed a stippled hyperautofluorescence pattern consistent with AZOOR\nin the left eye. Fluorescein angiography exhibited early blockage followed by late\nhyperfluorescence and nasal leakage in the left eye. Given her age, mild severity,\nand excellent vision, she was monitored without treatment and will undergo electroretinography\nand serial photography to track for progression.\nConclusion: This case demonstrates the difficulty with diagnosing AZOOR in the early stages of\nthe disease, which typically occurs in young and healthy females with a seemingly\nnormal fundus but non-specific symptoms such as photopsia. In this setting, the focus\nmay shift towards a neurological work-up; however, when ancillary testing does not\ncorrelate with clinical findings, such as non-glaucomatous visual field defects, the\ncause could be a subtle retinopathy rather than optic neuropathy.","title":"Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy AZOOR A Typical Exam but Atypical Visual Field","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185277\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Chicago\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Michael Blair\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Chicago\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The condition warrants a complete workup\nto determine the etiology as the consequences of an incorrect diagnosis can be severe.\nThis report highlights a case of bilateral optic disc edema in the setting of a recent\npresumed post-infectious encephalitis.\n\nCase Report: A 74 year-old Caucasian male presented with a 4 day history of acute, painless, inferior\nvision loss left eye. The patient's systemic history was remarkable for hypertension,\nhyperlipidemia, and sildenafil citrate use 2 months prior. He had recently travelled\nto SE Asia 1.5 months prior when he developed acute respiratory viral syndrome, followed\nby ataxia and cognitive dysfunction. Upon return to the US, the patient was hospitalized\nand underwent a complete infectious/inflammatory workup, which returned largely negative\nexcept for CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and an unrelated small left\nfrontal presumed meningioma. He was discharged home without any specific treatment\nand subsequently improved to near baseline. On exam, corrected visual acuity was 20/25+\nright and left eye, with an APD left eye. Posterior segment examination revealed superior\noptic disc edema left eye with several disc hemorrhages, and suspected mild disc edema\nsuperior nasal right eye, confounded by a crowded disc appearance.

Optic nerve\nOCT revealed significantly increased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness left eye\nmore than right eye. The patient did not have symptoms of temporal arteritis and diagnostic\nlabs returned normal. Blood pressure was normal. The case was discussed with neurology\nwho recommended repeat imaging and CSF studies given his recent presumed post-infectious\nencephalitis.

The purpose of this\nevaluation was to assess the samfilcon A single vision contact lens for stability\nof comfort, vision, lens cleanliness, and overall impression over 12 months of extended\nwear with monthly replacement.\nMethods: Contact lens wearers were refit into samfilcon A lenses. Subjects were instructed\nto wear the lenses for 6 nights/7 days and use only one multi-purpose solution for\nlens care (Biotrue multipurpose solution). Follow-up visits were scheduled for 1-Week,\n1-Month, 3-Months, 6-Months, 9-Months, and 12-Months. Overall Comfort (OC), Overall\nVision (OV), Lens Cleanliness Upon Removal (LC), and Overall Impression (OI) performance\nattributes were rated using a 0-100 scale with higher scores more favorable. The eye\nlevel raw data were converted to the subject level by averaging the scores of each\nsubject's right and left eyes by visit and outcome. Paired differences were evaluated\nfor equivalence using the two one-sided tests (TOST) method with adjusted one-sided\nalpha risks of 0.05 and an equivalence margin of five points.

The FDA has approved colored CLs\nfor medical and cosmetic reasons based off comfort and corneal health only. As most\nCLs are translucent, there is no expectation of interference with a patients' peripheral\nvision. However, as colored CLs have pigmentation in the periphery, there is a concern\nthat these CLs may decrease peripheral vision. Our research aims to determine the\npresence of any visual field defects with current readily available cosmetic CLs,\nand specifically whether the decrease will be significant enough to fail the legal\ndriving requirements for peripheral vision.\nMethods: Testing was performed on 30 participants. Visual acuity, pupil size, and anterior\nsegment health were evaluated. Room illumination was adjusted for pupil testing in\norder to simulate the lighting environment in the OCTOPUS visual field machine. Pupil\nsizes would later be compared to visual field responses. Esterman visual field testing\non the OCTOPUS was performed three times OU with variations; (1) no CL (control) applied,\n(2) light CL applied, and (3) dark CL applied. These variations were performed in\na randomized order to avoid confounding variables and patient learning effects. Subjects\nwere asked to discard lenses after testing, and anterior segment evaluation was performed\nto check for any corneal defects. The results were compared with the Arizona driving\nperipheral field standards of 70 degrees nasal and 35 degrees temporal.\nResults: An ANOVA was performed comparing the mean of the twelve most peripheral points within\nthe OCTOPUS Perimetry Visual Field each patient was able to recognize. The mean hits\nfor clear, light and dark were 11.53, 11.37, and 11.33 points respectively. A P-value\nof 0.565 was calculated, meaning there was no significant difference among clear,\nlight and dark groups. A Pearson's correlation was performed in order to determine\nif pupil size had any effect on peripheral point hits. The average pupil size was\nfound to be 5.483 mm with a negative correlation found between pupil size and test\nperformance while no contact lens was worn. No correlation was found between pupil\nsize while the light and dark blue contact lenses were worn.\nConclusion: Visual field constriction associated with the light or darkly tinted blue Alcon Freshlook\nColorblend opaque colored CLs was significantly low when compared to no CLs. Wearing\nthese lenses did not show to cause a visual field defect that would effect driving.\nThis result was not dependent on pupil size. It should be noted that this conclusion\ncannot be generalized to other brands of colored contact lenses. These other brands,\nas well as different colors, are possible considerations to include in future studies.","title":"Potential Visual Field Defects While Wearing Opaque Colored Contacts and the Implications  When Driving","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185268\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Patrizia Colmenares, Tyler Leuenberger, Kyle Dearing, Caitlin Miller, Christina Esposito, Jamie Kuhn\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Kokopelli Eye Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

At baseline and after two weeks of wear with each lens, overall opinion\nof lenses was assessed using the Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire-8 (CLDEQ-8) and\nthe Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS).\nResults: Mean age of enrolled subjects was 34.4 ± 3.2 years. The mean binocular spherical equivalent\nwas ˆ’4.14 ± 2.00 (ˆ’10.0 to ˆ’1.00 D). Mean habitual symptom scores for all subjects\nimproved significantly with the single vision Ultra® (CLDEQ-8 p < 0.001; CISS p\n<0.001) and the multifocal Ultra® lens (CLDEQ-8 p < 0.001; CISS p <0.001).\nFor the entire sample, there was no difference between multifocal and single vision\nCLDEQ-8 (p = 0.08) or CISS (p = 0.9) scores. There was a significant interaction between\nlens type and age group for both the CLDEQ-8 (p = 0.05) and the CISS (p = 0.03). Specifically,\nCLDEQ-8 scores with the single vision lens were significantly lower (less symptomatic)\nthan multifocal scores in subjects <35 years old (p = 0.01), but single vision\nand multifocal CLDEQ-8 scores for the older age group were not significantly different.\nWhen asked which lens type (habitual, single vision, multifocal) subjects preferred\nfor vision, those in the <35 year age group preferred the single vision lens for\nnear (p = 0.05), intermediate (p = 0.02), distance (p = 0.003), and overall vision\n(p = 0.0002). In the ? 35 year age group, there was no lens that was significantly\npreferred for vision overall or at a specific distance.\nConclusion: Symptom scores improved significantly with both the single vision and multifocal study\nlenses. This finding may indicate that the material, physical design, and/or\naspheric optics of the study lenses provide better performance than other soft lenses.\nSubjects in the in the younger (<35 years) age group had more favorable ratings\nwith the single vision lens compared to the multifocal lens. Younger non-presbyopic\ncontact lens wearers may prefer the wearing experience with aspheric single vision\nlenses, and those wearers approaching age 40 years may have similar wearing experience\nwith multifocal and single vision designs.","title":"Aspheric Contact Lens Treatment for Uncomfortable NonPresbyopes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185269\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lisa Jones-Jordan, Melissa Bailey\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Visual performance was modelled across adds +0.75 to +2.50D,\nRx -9.00 to +6.00D, vergence demands up to 2.50D and luminance levels up to 7,000\ncd/m\n2\n. Visual performance prediction of two MFCL designs (A: pupil optimized\ncenter-near aspheric 3-add system, B: fixed optic center-near aspheric 3-add system)\nwere compared with VA data from a clinical study.

This retrospective data analysis was conducted to validate\nthe software.\nMethods: The data used for validation came from a sample of 26 subjects, whose subjective refraction\ndata (sph, cyl, add, ocular dominance) was already determined and C1DM had already\nbeen fit and dispensed according to clinical assessments using the C1DM fitting guide.\nAfter 3-10 days all subjects attended a power optimization visit where the contact\nlens (CL) power was re-assessed and, if required, a new prescription was dispensed.\nThe subjective refraction data was subsequently entered in the OptiExpert app, and\nthe recommended CL power for each eye (OptiExpert-Rx) was compared to the power dispensed\nafter the optimization visit (Optimized-Rx). Correlation analysis was conducted between\nOptiExpert-Rx and Optimized-Rx. A Bland-Altman analysis comparison was also conducted\nto measure agreement between methods.\nResults: The 26 presbyopes (21 female, 5 male) had a mean (±SD) age of 56.7 (±7.4) years. Subjective\nrefraction range across all 52 eyes was +5.00 to -6.00 D sph with ? -1.00 D cyl. The\nreading add ranged between +1.50 to +2.50 D. 96% (25) of the subjects were successfully\nfit in the initial trial with the first pair of C1DM CLs, and the remaining 1 subject\nrequired 2 pairs of CLs. At the optimization visit a few days later, only 10% of eyes\n(5 eyes across 4 subjects) required a change in lens power, meaning 100% of eyes were\nsuccessfully fit with just 1 additional lens. In subjective responses, 92% reported\nthat C1DM CLs met or exceeded their visual needs.\nThe suggested OptiExpert-Rx\nwas significantly correlated with Optimized-Rx (r ? 0.996 and p <0.0001). Bland\nAltman analysis showed a mean difference (and 95% limits of agreement) between OptiExpert-Rx\nand Optimized-Rx of 0.09 D (-0.64 to +0.46).

Certain lens\ntypes are preferred for fitting this cohort of patients. Our study investigates the\noff-eye evaporation rate of five different types of contact lenses for 5 minutes.\nAll of the contact lens types studied are routinely used with dry eye patients. The\nstudy also investigated the effect of evaporation on the contact lens diameter over\ntime. The performance of the 5 different lens types was compared and contrasted.\nMethods: We measured 20 contact lenses for each of five different lens types. The five\ncontact lens types used were: Dailies Total 1, Biotrue ONEday, Acuvue 1-Day Moist,\nOasys 1-Day with HydraLuxe, and Acuvue Oasys with Hydraclear Plus. Each lens was removed\nfrom the manufacturer's blister pack. It was shaken 3 times, placed onto a weight\nboat, (whose weight had been previously zeroed out), and then the weight was measured\nwith a sealed balance to the nearest 0.1 mg. A new reading was made after each minute\nfor five minutes. After five minutes, the diameter of each contact lens was measured\nusing a hand-held magnifier with reticle. The initial diameter was assumed to be consistent\nwith that listed on each of the manufacturer's lens dimensions. Any observed weight\nchanges were presumed to occur due to the dehydrating effects on the lens. A statistical\ncomparison was performed at one-minute interval versus baseline.\nResults: All lenses experienced significant dehydration by the 5\nth\nminute (all p<0.01).\nThe mean percentage change in the weight of the lens ranged from 0.52 to 0.62% and\n6.7% to 8.2% after the 1\nst\nmin and 5\nth\nmin of evaporation, respectively.\nMost importantly, Acuvue 1 Day Moist demonstrated the most resistance to evaporation\ncompared to other lenses. The lens diameter reduced significantly for every one of\nthem. It ranged from a 2% reduction for Acuvue 1 Day Moist to a 6% reduction for BioTrue\nafter 5 mins. Although all lenses experienced a significant change in their lens diameter\nafter 5 mins, Acuvue 1 Day Moist was the most resistant to change.\nConclusion: While all lenses underwent reduction in diameter and weight after 5 minutes, Acuvue\n1 Day Moist demonstrated the most resistance to this change. Further investigations\nare warranted to study these changes on-eye in normal and dry eye individuals.","title":"Weight Diameter and Evaporation of Daily Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185272\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        AZ College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Terry Bell, Kalynn Egea, Tara Guinn, Stephanie Hilde, Balamurali Vasudevan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        AZ College of Optometry, AZ College of Optometry, AZ College of Optometry, AZ College of Optometry, AZ College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Medications were\nmometasone furoate oral inhaler, montelukast, etodolac, simvastatin, and tamsulosin.\nVisual\nacuity was 20/25 in the right eye (OD) and 20/30 in the left eye (OS). Pupils were\nequal, round, reactive to light, and without afferent defect. Confrontation fields\nwere full. Anterior chamber was quiet. Intraocular pressure was 13 mmHg OD, 15 mmHg\nOS.

Her chief complaint was blurred\nvision in both eyes, particularly in the morning. She reported a history of myopia\nand presbyopia, both corrected with spectacle lenses. Her medical history included\nmedication-controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nFasting blood glucose and HbA1c values were unknown. Her mother had been treated in\nMexico for glaucoma. No further family history was reported.\nCorrected visual\nacuities (VA) were 20/50 OD and 20/30 OS at distance and 20/30 OU at near. Pupils\nwere equally round and reactive with no APD noted. Extraocular motility testing revealed\nfull ranges of motion OD & OS. Confrontation visual field (VF) testing showed gross\nVF constriction in all quadrants OD & OS. Manual Goldmann VF testing showed severe\nconstriction to approximately 20 degrees centrally with the V4e target and approximately\n10 degrees centrally with the III4e target OD & OS. Manifest refraction gave no improvement\nin distance VA. Intraocular pressures were 18mmHg OD & OS via Goldmann applanation.\nDilated examination revealed similar findings in both eyes; optic disc pallor, severe\narterial attenuation and extensive RPE atrophy with pigmentary mottling throughout\nthe fundus but sparing the central macula. Macular OCT was normal OD and showed mild\ncystoid macular edema (CME) OS. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse hyperfluorescence\nOD & OS.\nGenetic testing showed the patient to be heterozygous in PRPF8\nfor a variant designated c.5140del, which is predicted to result in a frameshift error\nand premature protein termination (p.Ala1714Profs*21).\nConclusion: PRPF8 is located at 17p13.3 and codes for a spliceosome protein integral to\nthe pre-mRNA splicing process. While not previously reported, the variant in this\ncase is expected to be pathogenic. Pathogenic variants in PRPF8 occur in both\nfamilial and sporadic cases of retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

The atrophy\nseen in AMD can masquerade a spectrum of rare diseases including Posterior Polar Central\nChoroidal Dystrophy (PPCCD). This case report highlights the clinical appearance and\nimaging to diagnose PPCCD.\n\nCase Report: An 86-year old male with a long history of AMD presented for a comprehensive exam\nwith a chief complaint of being unhappy with his current glasses vision. Best-corrected\nvisual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS. Nearly a decade prior, macular mottling and\ndrusenoid changes led to the diagnosis and treatment of bilateral AMD with AREDS II\nSupplements, respectively. Over time, progressive atrophic macular changes on funduscopy\nled to several other working diagnoses: atrophic AMD vs. Acute Zonal Occult Outer\nRetinopathy vs. Serpiginous Choroiditis. Scattered hard drusen, extensive retinal\npigment epithelium and choroidal atrophy spanning the posterior pole and encircling\nthe optic disc in both eyes provided stark contrast from his previous exams. Macular\noptical coherence tomography from our exam showed outer retinal atrophy, loss of the\ninner/outer segment junction, and sub retinal fluid with degenerative material within\nthe area of atrophy. Optos fundus autofluorescence (FAF) displayed geographic hypoAF\nwith a border of hyperAF. Referral for a fluorescein angiography revealed window defects\nwithin the area of peripapillary atrophy. A diagnosis of PPCCD was made based on the\nclinical appearance by the extensive loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris\nwithin the vascular arcades and surrounding the optic nerve. Thereafter, the patient\nwas subsequently discontinued from AREDS II supplements.\nConclusion: While the early stages of Posterior Polar Central Choroidal Dystrophy can mimic AMD,\ndifferentials such as PPCCD should be considered when progression over time is observed,\nor the classic appearance changes. The results of follow up testing and imaging in\nour case report are shared to remind optometrists of this rare disease.","title":"If its not AMD its not AMD Imaging of Posterior Polar Central Choroidal Dystrophy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185275\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA West Los Angeles Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrea Yiasemis, Xiao (Shawn) Yu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA West Los Angeles Medical Center, VA West Los Angeles Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Mutation of the OA1/GPR143 gene on the X chromosome is a known cause of the\ndisease. Carriers are typically asymptomatic, but 80% show iris transillumination\nand approximately 92% have been shown to have a characteristic splotchy or mud splattered\nfundus with peripheral hyper pigmented streaks. FAF of an OA carrier shows hyper AF\nand hypo AF that correlate to the fundus appearance.\n\nCase Report: Case Reports: Three sisters, ages 21, 17, and 13 years old were referred from\nan outside provider to further evaluate the cause of widespread peripheral retinal\nhyper pigmentation. All presented with BCVA 20/20 OU and slit lamp examination was\nnormal without iris trans illumination OU. Their fundi appeared to have a splotchy\npattern of pigmentation and FAF showed a similar splotchy pattern of hyper and hypo\nAF. Macula OCT, EOG and ERG were normal in all three sisters.\nConclusion: Discussion: The sisters each show fundus and FAF abnormalities characteristic\nof OA carriers. Family history revealed that their father had very reduced vision\nand nystagmus. Genetic testing was performed and confirmed that the sisters were heterozygous\ncarriers of a mutation on the OA1/GPR143 gene. The father also tested positive for\na hemizygous mutation on the same gene. Others have reported this same pattern of\nFAF in OA carriers, however, this is the first report of FAF findings in three\nmembers of a family of known carriers of a mutation in the OA1 gene.\nConclusion:\nOA carriers can be identified using fundus examination and FAF, thereby allowing\nthe knowledge of carrier status. Knowledge of this FAF pattern is diagnostic and differentiates\nthis from a diagnosis of a progressive retinal degeneration, such as retinitis pigmentosa.","title":"Fundus Autofluorescence FAF Abnormalities in Three Sisters Who are Ocular Albinism  Carriers","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185276\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sherry Bass\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York, College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study was to develop a targeted evidence-based\npatient education tool designed to promote healthy SCL wear and care.\nMethods: The Contact Lens Assessment in Youth (CLAY) study group developed the Contact Lens\nRisk Survey (CLRS) to assess risk for SCL related adverse events. The CLRS is a 27-item,\nbranching logic digital instrument that can be administered on any web browser. Historical\ndata from the CLRS was utilized to delineate five constructs associated with risk;\nSCL care, SCL dependence, hygiene, living arrangement, and wellness. These five constructs\nwere collated into the Contact lens Assessments and Risk Education (CARE) report.\nA focus group completed the CLRS and at the conclusion of the survey, a subject received\nan individualized CARE report summarizing their score and wellness for each of the\nfive constructs.

A number of authors have reported\nthe UVR transmittance properties of contact lenses but rarely in the context of the\nInternational standard ISO 18369-1 (2017) Ophthalmic optics \"” Contact lenses\n\"” Part 1: Vocabulary, classification system and recommendations for labelling specifications,which\ncontains a classification system for UVR protection. The claims made by manufacturers\nhave not been assessed. Since a new version of ISO 18369-1 has just been published,\nit is an appropriate time to revisit the subject.\nMethods: A comprehensive set of contact lenses available on the Australian market was assembled\n(20 materials). All lenses were -3.00 D, the most commonly ordered power. Spectral\ntransmittances in the UV was measured using a twin beam UV-visible spectrophotometer\nwith the sample beam masked to 2 mm square centered on the geometric center of the\nlens. The lens was immersed in saline in a quartz cuvette and a saline filled matching\ncuvette was used in the reference beam. Three samples of each material were tested.\nThis method has been previously published. The UVA and UVB transmittances were calculated\naccording to ISO 18369-3 (2017) and \"Class 1\" or \"Class 2\" or no class was assigned\naccording to ISO 18369-1 (2017). The claims of the manufacturers on the packaging\nwere documented and compared with the performance found.\nResults: For 12 materials, no claim was made and no claim of a class was appropriate. Four\nmaterials were correctly claimed as Class 1. One material was correctly claimed as\nClass 2. One material was claimed to be UVA and UVB protective without numerical values\nand did not meet either class. One material was claimed to be UVA and UVB protective\nwithout numerical values but could have been correctly claimed as Class 2. One material\nwas correctly claimed to \"block 70% UVA96% UVB\" and could have been claimed to be\nClass 2.\nConclusion: UV protection in contact lenses is not a given. The absence of claims may be taken\nas appropriate. Claims of Class 1 and Class 2 may also be taken as appropriate. Qualitative\nclaims of UV protection may be seen as justified by compliance with, at least, Class\n2 but failure to comply with Class 2 is not consitent with any UV protective claim.\nThe numerical claims, without a class, make it difficult for a practitioner or patient\nto understand how the claim ranks relative to Class 1 and 2. In the case of the numerical\nclaim, it was only as good as Class 2. Use of the ISO 18369-1 system is a clear communication\nof the relative merits of contact lenses as UV protectors. Non-standard qualitative\nor numerical claims, even with some justification, make understanding the adequacy\nof protection and the relative merits of materials unnecessarily difficult.","title":"Ultraviolet Protection in Soft Contact Lenses Claims and Performance","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185261\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of NSW\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Irene Jin, Fiona Tao, Lily Ho, Helen Swarbrick\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of NSW, University of NSW, University of NSW, University of NSW\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study was to develop a novel in-vitro\ndrip model to determine if bacterial adhesion to a CL material was possible. The novel\nin-vitro drip model would more closely resemble an accurate eye model in comparison\nto current methods undertaken.\nMethods: The novel in-vitro drip method consists of a 5.5 mL syringe with saline solution and\na flow rate controller dispensing 5 µl of saline solution containing the bacteria.\nThe consistent drip volume is adjustable and mimics the normal human tear volume and\nflow. The solution flows through a silicone tube and onto a CL. The CL was placed\non a sterile glass eyeball in an enclosed container to maintain the environment's\nhumidity. In the soak method, the CL was placed on top of a sterile glass eyeball\nand placed in the enclosed container with a 5 mL saline solution of 1.0 x 10\n7\ncolony forming units (CFU)/mL. For both methods, lenses were incubated in the solution\nfor 16 hours. After removal, the viable cells were diluted in serial dilutions. Aliquots\nof each dilution were plated on a trypticase soy agar plate and incubated for 24 hours\nat 37°C. After 24 hours, the CFU per lens were calculated manually under magnification.\nResults: Using the in-vitro drip method, adhesion of Staphyloccocus aureus onto senofilcon\nA was successfully demonstrated. Preliminary analysis showed no significant difference\n(p = 0.34) between the drip and soak method when compared at high CFU/mL.\nConclusion: The novel drip method is a promising alternative to the conventional soak method,\nas this model is closer to the contamination that would occur in a human eye. The\ndrip method may be an acceptable method of testing once the method can be further\ndeveloped and tested in future studies, using a variety of lenses and bacteria.","title":"Novel InVitro Method to Study Bacterial Interaction with Contact Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185262\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Asiya Jabeen, Lakshman Subbaraman, David McCanna, Chau-Minh Phan, Lyndon Jones\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Extended exposure to the ambient air may lead to a breakup of lens\nsurface moisture. Furthermore, this breakup will lead to a degradation of the optical\nquality of the lens due to irregularity of surface moisture and scatter from the surface\nroughness of the underlying bulk material. The purpose of this investigation is to\nobjectively measure the optical quality through contact lenses during the dehydration\nprocess.\nMethods: An achromatic doublet with one surface having a radius of curvature similar to that\nof the cornea is mounted in a 3D printed \"sclera\" so as to provide a smooth transition\nbetween the lens and sclera. This artificial eye enables contact lenses to be placed\nonto its surface. A camera is then used to view an ETDRS chart at optical infinity\nthrough the eye model assembly. For measurement, a contact lens blister pack is opened.\nThe lens is removed and a drop of the packaging fluid is placed onto the back surface\nof the lens. The lens is then placed on the eye model and aligned to ensure good centration\nwith respect to the cornea and that no air bubbles are present underneath the contact\nlens. A second drop of packaging fluid is then placed on the anterior surface of the\ncontact and a two-minute video clip of the eyechart viewed through the system is recorded.\nLetter visibility and contrast over time are assessed to determine the optical performance\nwith time.\nResults: Two distinct progressions of the optical quality exist that are dependent upon the\ncontact lens material. The first type of progression has the letter targets steadily\nblur and lose contrast. The optical quality will ultimately reach a minimum and then\nbegin to improve to varying degrees. This effect is interpreted as the underlying\ncontact lens surface being smooth and image quality is restored once the lens surface\nmoisture has fully evaporated. Conversely, the second type of progression has the\nletter targets blur and lose contrast and then remain in that state. This is interpreted\nas the underlying contact lens surface being rough once the lens surface moisture\nis fully evaporated. The rates of degradation are also strongly contact lens material\ndependent.\nConclusion: The system provides a means for measuring the optical quality through a contact lens\nand the degradation of this quality as a function of lens surface moisture breakup.\nFuture work includes enhancing the system to simultaneously provide imaging of the\nlens surface moisture to better understand the lens surface dehydration dynamics.","title":"Measurement of the Optical Quality of Contact Lens Materials with Dehydration","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185263\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Arizona\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The inclusion of a blister pack solution additive that aids in\nreduction of bacteria introduced via lens handling targets a primary lens contamination\npathway in Daily Disposable wear. It was previously reported that handled stenfilcon\nA lenses packaged in blister solution with 100 microgram/mL e-poly-L-lysine (e-PL)\ndemonstrated reduced bacterial contamination versus lenses with no e-PL. This study\nevaluates the efficacy of e-PL-packaged lenses against an expanded panel of bacterial\nstrains via a new methodology. In addition, long term activity of e-PL solution is\nexamined.\nMethods: Protection during lens handling was evaluated against P.aeruginosa, S.aureus, S.epidermidis,\nB.simplex and E.coli, all potential opportunistic bacterial pathogens that have\nbeen associated with ocular inflammation and/or infection. ~100 colony forming units\n(CFUs) were individually introduced to the blister containing e-PL (Test) or PBS alone\n(Control). Lenses then were handled in a manner mimicking routine lens removal from\nthe blister pack prior to insertion. Handled lenses were collected and evaluated for\nrecovered bacteria. Reduction in bioburden was calculated as the difference between\nthe mean CFUs (± standard deviation) collected from the Control and the Test lenses\nand presented as percent reduction (PR). A two-tailed Student's t-test was used for\nstatistical analysis. Long term activity of e-PL blister pack solution was assessed\nvia ISO 14730 methodology against the standard challenge panel of bacteria and fungi.\nActivity of freshly prepared samples and samples stored up to 45°C for a 4-year equivalent\nshelf life period were evaluated (n=3 replicates per time point).\nResults: Lenses packed in the Test solution had lower microbial counts than lenses packed in\nthe Control solution. Statistically significant reduction was observed for all organisms\n(P.aeruginosa CFUs 42+2 vs 12+16, PR=71%, S.aureus CFUs\n92+9 vs 60+12, PR=34%, S.epidermidis CFUs 84+18\nvs 29+21,PR=66%; B.simplex CFUs 41+1 vs 2+3, PR=95%, E.coli\nCFUs 74+21 vs 22+8, PR=71%; p<0.05 for all).

Moreover, these steps are frequently changed / modified\nby practitioners in their practice. We propose to explore new methods of \"fog\" and\n\"defog\" test that can address these issues. We will compare those new methods to the\nstandard methodology, with the evaluation of the impact of operators.\nMethods: In a first test (TEST 1), 20 subjects participated in the study.Three fog methods\nwere tested: the standard method (FOG A) which consist of adding a convex lens of\n+2D, a new method based on the disappearance of a Vanish letter (FOG B) and a third\none based on the evaluation of the first blur perceived on a black and white letter\n(FOG C).Three methodologies of defog were studied: the standard method (UNFOG A) which\nconsisted of the decrement of lenses on steps of 0,25D, a new method which propose\nto make the defog test with three lenses thanks to an estimation of defocus of the\neye according to the current visual acuity that can be measured with a standard acuity\ntest (UNFOG B), or with a new visual acuity test (DEFOG C).Accuracy, subjective appreciation\nand duration of test have been analyzed. In a second test (TEST 2), 5 subjects participated\nto the study.These subjects were recruited for 3 visits conducted by 3 different operators\nthat carried out two \"fog-defog\"\nMethods: the standard method and the new method. The impact of the operator on the\naccuracy and the duration of the test for the two methods have been studied.\nResults: TEST 1 revealed that compared to the standard method (FOG A), FOG B was most appreciated\nby more than half of the subjects who could express a preference for one of them.\nIn addition, this method doesn't show a significant difference in the final fog value\n(mean: -0,08D) and blurred visual acuity (mean:-0,1logMar) (p=0.28 and p=0.60) unlike\nFOG C method (0,30D and +0,1logMar respectively (p <0.01)) (see fig. 1). Regarding\nthe defog tests, compared to the standard method (DEFOG A), the final defog value\n(see fig. 2) with DEFOG B showed no significant difference (mean=0,05D;p=0.49) unlike\nDEFOG C (mean=0,14D;p <0.01) which was nonetheless subjectively more appreciated\nby 69% of subjects who have expressed a preference. TEST 2 did not show any operator-related\ndifferences in performing these methods (see fig. 3 and 4).\nConclusion: These studies validate the interest and feasibility of a new fog-defog method which\nis a test that can be used in practice during the measurement of subjective refraction\nto control the accommodation.","title":"Validation of New Fog and Defog Methodology for Subjective Refraction Assessment","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185247\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Essilor\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Marc Vincent\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Essilor\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Treatment with\nscleral contact lens improved pain and ocular surface disease. Our patient had a history\nof squamous cell carcinoma of the right upper eyelid. It was removed using the Mohs\ntechnique, and required lid reconstruction using the Tenzel Simicircular flap. The\napplication of a scleral a contact lens was valuable in improving corneal health and\nreducing symptomatic pain. This case report describes the role and efficacy of scleral\ncontact lenses in the treatment of keratopathy in patients who have undergone periocular\nsurgical procedures.\n\nCase Report: A 69-year-old White male was referred by the ocular plastics division for a contact\nlens evaluation. The patient had minimal lid closure covering only 30% of the superior\ncornea. At the time of the visit, the patient displayed severe frustration with his\neye and was requesting enucleation in hopes of relieving the continuous pain. A background\nhistory on the patient revealed a basal cell carcinoma that was removed with a Mohs\ntechnique with additional lid reconstruction. Due to the reconstruction of the lid,\nthe patient developed a severe case of triachasis, which left his eyelashes rubbing\nagainst his cornea. The incomplete lid closure resulted in significant exposure to\nkeratopathy.\nAfter evaluating the cornea and the disability of an incomplete lid\nclosure, it was determined that a scleral contact lens would be the only option. Prior\nto his referral to the Special Contact Lens clinic, the patient had been using soft\nbandage contact lenses, which left the patient with minimal relief. Although the bandage\ncontact lens relieved the triachasis, this rubbing against the rare cornea through\nthe bandage contact lens did very little for correcting the irregular astigmatism\nand keeping the exposure keratopathy at bay.\nThe patient's entering visual acuity\nduring initial visit was 20/400 in the right and 20/20 in the left. Inferior scarring\nwas noted with severe punctuated epithelial erosion in the right eye. The patient\nwas fit in a mini scleral contact lens. After one month, the scleral contact lens\nfitting was complete with successful comfort, movement, and vision. The finial visual\nacuity was 20/30. Significant decrease in punctate epithelial were noted. In addition,\na decrease in the corneal stroma hazing was observed.\nConclusion: The rigidity of the scleral contact lens acted as the best possible bandage contact\nlens. The vault and hard lens characteristic corrected for the minor astigmatic irregularity\nof the cornea and could provide better vision. Additionally, the water reserve in\nthe lens helped to keep the cornea hydrated in order to improve the exposure keratopathy.","title":"Scleral Contact Lens Used in Post Periocular Surgical Procedures","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185248\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Virginia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Evan Kaufman\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Virginia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

The patient was symptomatic of severe eye dryness,\nocular discomfort, and pain secondary to the blinking anomaly. She consulted another\neyecare practitioner and was fitted with a 14.6 mm diameter scleral lens, but remained\nwith signifcant symptoms despite an intense lubrication regimen (artifical tears multiple\ntimes per hour and ointment at night). The patient was seen at the Montreal School\nof Optometry clinic about a year later with evidence of exposure keratopathy and lack\nof lubrication in the right eye. Ocular health otherwise (and in OS) was found normal.\nCorneal\ntopography was performed using Pentacam and the ocular surface was mapped with sMap\n3D eye profiler. A custom made Europa lens with diameter 18.0 mm and toric haptics\nwas ordered for the patient. The lens was found to be centered and stable after 30\nminutes of dispensing. The central clearance was sufficient at 328 um under OCT and\nconjunctival alignment was reached in every quadrant. The patient reported good comfort\nand vision (20/25). Patient was instructed to use non-preserved saline solution to\nfill the bowl, mixed with sodium hyaluronate based non-preserved artifcial tears.\nLubrication during the day was allowed as needed using non-preserved artifcial tears\nand the use of ointement at night was maintained. Hydrogene peroxide system was recommended\nfor the care of the lens.\nPatient was seen a month later and reported a huge\nimprovement in her condition. She reported a clear vision (20/25) and a comfortable\ncontact lens wear of 12 hours/day in average. She felt the need to use lubrication\nduring the day only under challenging conditions (air conditioning, etc.). The lens\nwas found centered and stable with adequate central clearance (227 um).

The most common presenting symptoms are dry eye and dry mouth, ranging\nfrom mild discomfort to debilitating symptoms. When traditional therapies fail in\nmanaging recalcitrant ocular surface disease, patients may be prescribed autologous/allogeneic\nserum, scleral lenses, and/or adjunctive surgical treatments. This case report highlights\na SS patient status-post glaucoma drainage device (shunt and bleb) with debilitating\nocular dryness symptoms. She had failed with all previous therapies at managing her\nocular surface disease but significant improvements in signs and symptoms were noted\nwith an ocular impression-based device, EyePrintPro.\n\nCase Report: A 74 year-old Caucasian female presented for a dry eye consultation with symptoms\nof irritation and burning for over 20 years due to SjÃ¶gren's Syndrome and rheumatoid\narthritis for which she is presently managed by rheumatology. Her current dry eye\nregimen included autologous serum tears 6 times per day, preservative free artificial\ntears every hour, Omega 3 supplements 1000mg po bid, doxycycline 50mg bid po. She\nhad previously failed with ointments, topical cyclosporine and topical lifitegrast\ndue to severe ocular burning. She had all four punta permantently occluded, Lipiflow\nperformed 2 years prior and presented wearing moisture goggles. She had a positive\nocular history of glaucoma surgery (shunt and bleb) OD and was taking Zioptan every\nnight OU. She was closely monitored by a glaucoma specialist. Entering acuities were\n20/100 OD, pH 20/50 and 20/25 OS. Slit lamp examination revealed lid telangiectasia\nOU, 2+ Meibomian gland dysfunction, lid and conjunctival injection, an anterior chamber\nshunt valve OD, and posterior chamber IOLs that were in good position OU. Trace inferior\npunctate epithelial erosions were noted OU. Secondary to the patient's history, examination\nfindings, and large bleb OD, the EyePrintPro was selected to vault over the bleb and\nto enhance ocular comfort. The patient's vision improved to 20/25 OD, OS and she has\nbeen successfully wearing the devices for over one year,noting a marked improvement\nin ocular comfort and reduction in lid, conjunctival redness. Her IOPs have remained\nstable at 13mmHg OU.\nConclusion: Patients with refractory ocular surface disease further complicated by conditions\nsuch as glaucoma surgery can be extremely difficult to manage with traditional scleral\nlens designs. The EyePrintPro utilizes an impression of the ocular surface to make\na truly customized device of the ocular surface, providing improved vision, an optimal\nfit and ocular surface protection.

Under this\nassumption, it is plausible that a lens with a smaller treated area (and larger area\nof peripheral defocus) may lead to improved myopia control. This pilot study seeks\nto compare the standard CRT lens, which carries a 6mm optic zone diameter (OZD) to\na novel lens design (the \"test lens\") with a 5mm OZD in order to evaluate the feasibility,\ntime, cost, adverse events, and improve upon the study design prior to embarking on\na full-scale clinical trial to test this hypothesis.\nMethods: This was a subject-masked, prospective randomized crossover study. 5 subjects who\nmet the eligibility criteria were enrolled and randomly allocated to wear either the\nstandard lens or the test lens for one month (with follow-up visits at 1-day, 1-week,\n2-weeks and 1-month) in both eyes. After a washout period, they were switched to the\nalternate lens design. At each visit, autorefraction (AR), manifest refraction, VA,\nand corneal topography were collected. Pupil size was measured at baseline. At the\n1-week and 1-month visits, subjective vision information was collected via a questionnaire.\nAt the 1-month visit, contrast sensitivity was measured using the quick CSF (Adaptive\nSensory Technologies). All exams took place between the hours of 8am and 10am.\nResults: This study was not powered for significance, therefore, only the mean (±SE) is reported.\nUnaided visual acuity was similar with the standard and test lenses (-0.012 ± 0.046\nLogMAR vs +0.005 ± 0.050 LogMAR, respectively). On-axis AR revealed low hyperopia\nfor the test lens group (average +0.44 ± 0.29D), which is close to the +0.50D target\nrefraction, but low myopia for the 6mm OZD group (-0.44 ± 0.41D). Contrast sensitivity,\nwhich we hypothesized would be worse with the test lens, actually had a higher area\nunder the log contrast sensitivity function (AULCSF) with the test lens compared to\nthe standard (1.75±0.09 vs 1.57±0.12). When subjects were asked to guess which design\nthey were wearing based on visual performance related symptoms such as glare and haloes,\nall but one subject guessed incorrectly, preferring their vision with the 5mm OZD\nover the standard 6mm OZD lenses.\nConclusion: In contrast to the predicted worse vision due to the smaller OZD, and hence smaller\ntreatment area on the cornea, most subjects reported non-inferior visual performance\nwith the 5.0mm OZD compared to that with the 6.0mm OZD. We hypothesize that the smaller\ntreatment area allows for a more consistent treatment across the central cornea, hence\nminimizing visual disruption due to subtle irregularity in the treated area.","title":"A Pilot Study Comparing CRT Orthokeratology Lenses with Two Different Treatment Zone  Sizes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185252\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California, Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Yue (Maria) Liu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California, Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Demographics,\ncause of injury, baseline clinical data including zone of injury according to the\nOcular Trauma Classification Group and vision were obtained. Follow up clinical data\nincluding contact lens evaluation when available was also recorded.\nResults: There were 82 patients who underwent open globe repair and 83% (n=60) were transferred\nfrom an outside hospital. The majority (78%) were male and 34% (n=28) African-American,\n32% (n=26) white, 24% (n=20) hispanic, 2.5% (n=2) Asian, and 7% unknown (n=6). The\nmean age at presentation was 41 years old. Most of the injuries were reported to be\ndue to an accident (n=62) followed by an altercation (n=17). More than half had globe\nrupture (52%, n=43) followed by laceration ( 48%, n=39 ), defined according to Birmingham\nEye Trauma Terminology. There were 29 patients with Zone 1 injuries, 15 patients with\nzone 2 injuries, and 30 patients with zone 3 injuries.\nPre-operative vision was\nno light perception (NLP) or light perception (LP) in 33 patients. In 40 patients\nwith hand motion (HM) or better vision, the mean entering VA was 1.7 (~20/1113). There\nwas no association between cause of injury (accident vs. altercation) and age (p=0.2)\nor gender (p=0.2).\nFifteen patients were evaluated for contact lens evaluation.\nOf these, 53% were referred by the cornea service. Reasons for referral included aphakia\n(n=6), poor vision (n=5), corneal pathology (n=7), and photophobia (n=2). Injuries\naffected Zone 1 in 8 patients, Zone 2 in 2 patients, and Zone 3 in 3 patients, though\nnone of the patients with zone 3 injury had macular scarring. Mean visual acuity with\nmanifest refraction was 0.7 (~20/103) and improved to 0.3 (~20/43) with contact lens\n(p<0.001). The zone of injury was not associated with final visual acuity (p=0.91).\nFinal lens type prescribed included 4 soft, 5 corneal gas permeable, 2 hybrid, 3 piggyback\ncontact lenses and 1 patient discontinued contact lens use.\nConclusion: The majority of open globe injuries evaluated at IEEI were due to accident compared\nto altercation. Contact lenses may improve vision in patients regardless of zone of\ninjury, particularly in the absence of macular pathology, and proper referral should\nbe considered for all patients being managed post repair.","title":"Impact of Contact Lens Fitting on Visual Outcomes Following Open Globe Repair at an  Urban Tertiary Care Hospital","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185253\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIC Department of Ophthalmology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ellen Shorter, Grace Dunbar, Yannek Leiderman\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIC Department of Ophthalmology, UIC Department of Ophthalmology, UIC Department of Ophthalmology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Axial growth was calculated\nas the difference in axial length before and one year after orthokeratology. A growth\nless than 0.30 mm was considered as effective control. Corneal topography was obtained\nbefore and one year after lens dispatch. The topography was divided into 36 ten-degree\nslices and the mRCRP in each was calculated and fitted into a model that integrated\nthe effects of mean refractive power (M), corneal asymmetry (f1), and astigmatism\n(f2). The relationship between the probability of achieving effective control and\nthe modulation of mRCRP was analyzed with logistic regression.\nResults: One hundred and thirty-four subjects achieved effective control but for ten the treatment\nwas ineffective. The M-values were not different between the groups. Modulations of\nmRCRPs were significantly larger in the effective group than the ineffective group\n(1.25 vs. 0.62D for f1, P = 0.01; 0.88 vs. 0.33D for f2, P = 0.01). The probability\nto achieve effective control increased with the modulation of mRCRP (P = 0.01). With\na peak mRCRP less than 1.2D or greater than 4.5D, a subject had a below 20% or an\nabove 80% chance to achieve effective control respectively.\nConclusion: A large modulation in the spatial profile of mRCRP improves the probability of achieving\neffective myopic control with orthokeratology.\nSignificance: We developed\na novel model that integrates the effects of mean spherical equivalent, corneal asymmetry\nand corneal astigmatism into the calculation of the relative corneal refractive power\nspatial distribution. This model yields a single metric, maximal relative corneal\nrefractive power (mRCRP), to quantify the probability of achieving an effective control\nof myopic progression via a logistic regression-based analysis. Since the corneal\nshape usually stabilizes one month after lens wearing, our model potentially enables\nclinicians to know the outcome early in the course of orthokeratology lens treatment.","title":"Axial Length Elongation and the Distribution of Peripheral Relative Power in Myopic  Children Treated with Overnight Orthokeratology","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185254\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Hua Bi, Rui Jiang, Jun Jiang, Bin Zhang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry, Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry, Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Accumulation of\ndebris in the post-lens fluid reservoir or surface non- wetting may necessitate periodic\nremoval of scleral lenses during the day. The SCOPE (Scleral Lenses in Current Ophthalmic\nPractice Evaluation) study team conducted a multi-center study to assess the prevalence\nof mid-day fogging and lens removal.\nMethods: An online survey of eye care providers was conducted from December 13, 2016 to March\n31, 2017. Scleral Lens Education Society members were invited to participate via e-mail.\nLinks to the survey were also posted on the Scleral Lens Fitters Facebook page and\nincluded in two online newsletters (I-Site and BCLA newsletter). Prescribers were\nasked to provide information about their most recently evaluated established scleral\nlens patient (history of ? 6 months of lens wear). We report the prevalence of mid-day\nfogging, along with wearing patterns, in this population.\nResults: We received 292 responses representing 26 countries. Mean patient age was 44 ± 14\nyears (mean ± SD; n=285) (range 18-86 years); gender distribution was 184 male, 108\nfemale. Bilateral wear was reported in 233 patients, 27 wore a scleral lens in the\nright eye only, and 32 wore a lens in the left eye only. 248 participants responded\nto a survey item which asked if patient had issues with mid-day fogging; 64 (25%)\nof patients reported such issues. 247 participants responded to a survey item asking\nif their patients routinely removed and reapplied their lens periodically during the\nday: 66 (27%) patients reported doing so at least once during the day. Of the patients\nwho reported mid-day fogging (n=64), 39 (61%) reported removing their lenses during\nthe day; of the patients who did not report mid-day fogging (n=181), 26 (14%) reported\nremoving their lenses during the day.

The purpose of this study\nis to compare a new method of subjective self-refraction (EyeNetra® device) to conventional\nsubjective refraction as well as the EyeNetra® refined by a professional.\nMethods: 36 participants (n = 72 eyes), aged between 18 - 35 and naÃ¯ve to optometry, performed\nthree refractive methods in a random order: subjective refraction by a professional\n(PRO), subjective self-refraction with the EyeNetra device performed by the subject\nalone (EyeNetraNov) and a subjective self-refraction with the EyeNetra device refined\nby a professional (EyeNetraPro). Conventional subjective refraction was performed\naccording to the technique of Clinical Procedures in Primary Eye Care 4th Edition\n(Elliott 2013). Sphere, cylinder and axis were measured for each refractive method.\nUsing a randomized order and double-blind design, the three refraction results were\nfitted in trial frames, to measure distance LogMAR visual acuity and to obtain subjective\nappreciation and visual comfort by questionnaire.\nResults: Equivalent sphere obtained by EyeNetraNov self-refraction (x = -2.09D ± 1.75) was\nsignificantly more negative than those obtained by the two other methods EyeNetraPro\n(x = -1.61 ± 1.96) and PRO (x = -1.54 ± 1.94) (Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests,\nall p < 0.01). This negative overcorrection reached at least 0.75 D in 50% of the\ncases. No statistically significant difference was found comparing values of cylinder\n(p = 0.9) or axis (p = 0.9). Repeated ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc analysis showed\nthat the mean LogMAR visual acuity obtained with refraction PRO (x = -0.148 ± 0.011)\nwas significantly greater than self-refractions EyeNetraPro (x = -0.093 ± 0.013; p\n< 0.01) and EyeNetraNov (x = -0.082 ± 0.017, p < 0.01). 72% of participants\npreferred glasses made with refraction PRO against 20% with EyeNetraPro and 8% for\nEyeNetraNov.\nConclusion: Our results show that the EyeNetra self-refraction system induces a significant negative\novercorrection of the equivalent sphere when used without a professional and that\nthe visual acuity is significantly lower than that obtained with a conventional subjective\nrefraction. These results suggest that the EyeNetra system cannot substitute for conventional\nrefraction, but it could be used as a starting point for a complete visual examination\nby a professional.","title":"Comparing a New Subjective SelfRefractive Method to a Conventional Measure of Refractive  Errors","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185237\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nikola Bouffard St-Pierre, Marie-Christine Garceau, Marie-Maxime Bellemare, Benoit Tousignant\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

To test the\nmethod empirically in normally-sighted subjects, and in simulated subjects with highly\naberrated eyes.\nMethods: Participants were 35 young, normally-sighted subjects with natural pupils and accommodation.\nSubjects viewed Gaussian-attenuated square wave gratings at four orientations (0°,\n45°, 90° and 135°) with a 2.5 cycle/degree fundamental spatial frequency. The maximum\nplus spherical dioptric power for best subjective clarity was determined for each\ngrating orientation, yielding the refractive correction needed in the four cardinal\nmeridians. The sphero-cylindrical correction is represented by the one cycle sinusoid\nthat best fits those data. Within- and between-session test-retest (T-RT) differences\nin M, J0, and J45 were calculated, as were astigmatic and total dioptric power differences.\nGoodness-of-fit metrics were derived from the differences in measured values within\neach orientation, and from the differences between the measured values and the best-fitting\nsphero-cylindrical power. Visual acuity was measured with each resulting sphero-cylindrical\ncorrection. Simulated refractions of highly-aberrated eyes were performed, using the\ncontrast of spatially-filtered gratings to determine the power for best focus.\nResults: In normally-sighted subjects, median between-session T-RT differences for astigmatism\nare similar to published values for standard subjective refraction: ~0.13 D for both.\nMedian differences for total dioptric power are larger than published values (0.26\nD vs 0.20 D). The 95th percentile for astigmatic and total dioptric differences are\nlarger by up to 40%, attributed to a greater number of outliers. LogMAR acuity is\nsignificantly correlated with the goodness-of-fit metrics. Simulations in highly aberrated\neyes produce sphero-cylindrical corrections that maximize image quality, and are correlated\nwith image quality metrics. Highly aberrated eyes also frequently produce spurious\ncontours from phase shifts at higher spatial frequencies.\nConclusion: In normally-sighted subjects, this method results in median T-RT difference distributions\nthat are similar to those found with standard subjective refraction. The method could\nbe adapted for use in settings in which full clinical resources and highly-trained\npersonnel are not available. In highly aberrated eyes, spurious contours may make\njudgments of subjective clarity of complex targets (e.g. typical optotypes) more variable\nthan similar judgments of simpler targets, such as gratings, containing a single orientation\nand a limited number of spatial frequencies.","title":"SpheroCylindrical Refraction with Spherical Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185238\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Thomas Raasch\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in indoor and outdoor\nlighting characteristics and to further investigate the association between outdoor\nexposure and myopia presence and severity.\nMethods: University students aged 18-24 (n=12 non-myopes, SER: +1.375 to -0.375 D; n=18 myopes,\n-1.375 to -6.75D) participated during an academic period. Participants wore continuously\nrecording light sensor devices (Actiwatch) on their non-dominant arm over clothes\nfor 2 weeks. Light intensity and spectral composition (RGB) data were averaged over\n1-min epochs and intensity >1000lux was used as a proxy for outdoor activity. Spectral\ncomposition was analyzed in terms of the average and variability in the ratio of long\n(red) to short (blue) wavelengths (R:B ratio) experienced across the 2-week measurement\nperiod. During the 2-week wearing period, participants also reported the amount of\ndevice use (e.g. computers, phones) and near/intermediate activity they performed\neach day.\nResults: Regardless of myopia status, participants experienced more long vs. short wavelengths\nwhen outdoors as compared to indoors (mean R:B ratio = 4.82:1 and 3.04:1, respectively\n(p<0.001)).

While the R:B ratio tended\nto be smaller for myopes compared to non-myopes, for both outdoors and indoors (4.64:1\nvs 5.10:1 and 3.00:1 vs 3.13:1, respectively), the differences were not statistically\nsignificant. On average, myopes also tended to go outdoors less frequently than non-myopes\n(3.48 vs. 3.00 times a day), and for shorter periods of time (8.83 mins vs. 11.34\nmins).

This study examined\nthe changes in peripheral refractive error with different accommodative demands.\nMethods: Measurements were taken with a Grand Seiko WAM 5500 open field autorefractor on 26\neyes with no history of refractive surgery and/or therapy (13 pre-presbyopic subjects,\n8 females and 5 males). Central refractive errors ranged from -0.50 to +1.00 diopters\n(mean = 0.06D, SD = 0.31D), and central astigmatism was less than 1.00DC in each eye.\nCentral and peripheral refractive errors were measured in 10\no\nsteps up\nto 30\no\nacross both the temporal and the nasal horizontal retinal eccentricities.\nTargets were presented at 6 m, 40 cm, and 25 cm, with the near targets arranged in\nan arc to maintain equal distances throughout different directions of gaze.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a single\ndose of 0.01% atropine on pupil size and accommodative function (biomarkers for active\ndrug levels) over the course of 8 hours.\nMethods: 12 participants received a single drop of 0.01% atropine in their non-dominant eye.\nFollowing administration of the drop, pupil diameter and accommodative amplitude were\nassessed every minute for the first five-minute interval, every five minutes for the\nsubsequent 25-minute interval, and at the 1, 2, 4, and 8-hour marks. Pupil diameter\nwas measured monocularly using an automated pupillometer (NeurOptics, Irvine, CA).\nAccommodative amplitude was measured monocularly via the pull-away method using 0.6M\nLEA symbols.

Anterior segment ocular biometry measurements including\nACD, CCT and LT were obtained using LS900 Lenstar (Haag-Streit) or CASIA optical coherence\ntomographer (Tomey). Measurements were taken at 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm to assess\ndiurnal changes of each parameter, and to establish an 8am baseline reading. On a\nseparate day, 1 drop of 1% atropine was instilled into each eye at 8am and measurements\nwere repeated at 1, 12, 24, and 96 hours after eye drop instillation.\nResults: The CCT (p<0.001), but not LT or ACD (both p > 0.05), demonstrated significant\ndiurnal thinning over the course of 12 hours. Instillation of 1.0% atropine eyedrops\nsignificantly reduced the CCT compared to baseline (p<0.001), but the thinning\nwas not different from the diurnal thinning observed (p=0.142). The LT, which did\nnot exhibit diurnal changes, thinned after atropine instillation at 1, 12, 24, and\n96 hour time points (all p<0.001). Correspondingly, ACD widened after atropine\ninstillation at all measured time points (all p<0.001).\nConclusion: The CCT demonstrated diurnal thinning over the course of the day. We observed thinning\nof LT and an increase in ACD after atropine eye drop instillation, likely associated\nwith atropine's cycloplegic effects and relaxation of the ciliary muscle.

Findings indicate that increased\nlipofuscin accumulation play a key role in several pathologies such as AMD. Lipofuscin\naccumulates as a waste product from excess light exposure. The aim of this study was\nto investigate the relationship between refractive errors, axial length, pupil size,\nrecall of childhood light exposure, and quantification of lipofuscin. Our plan was\nto test competing hypotheses that hyperopic eyes were more likely to accumulate lipofuscin\nbecause of their axial length and plus lenses' optical properties or, alternatively,\nmyopia has less lipofuscin due potentially because of less light exposure at a young\nage.\nMethods: Forty-eight healthy adult subjects aged from 21 to 30 years with different refractive\nerror conditions were recruited; forty-six myopic eyes, thirty-five emmetropic eyes\nand fifteen hyperopic eyes. Subjects have no ocular/ systemic diseases or any medication\nknown to affect the retina or ocular media including vitamin supplements. A questionnaire\ninquired about age, gender, ethnicity, ocular history, smoking status, their current\ncorrection and duration of wear. Recall of diet and daily time spent outdoors was\nqueried currently and age six to ten. The data of spherical equivalent refraction,\npupil size before and after dilation and macular pigment ocular density were collected.\nTwo readings on a Zeiss IOL Master was used with the average of five measurements\nof axial length. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images were taken for each dilated\neye using VISUCAM 244 Zeiss fundus autofluorescent camera to quantify lipofuscin.\nWe developed our quantification method by analyzing the luminance of the entire picture.\nResults: We observed a very high correlation between axial length and a luminance measure of\nlipofuscin for myopes (R\n2\n= 0.605), but no correlation for emmetropes (R\n2\n= 0.03). We noticed that the hyperopic photographs contained a smaller portion of\nthe retina than the myopic photos. We adjusted the size of all pictures to meet a\nstandard distance between the fovea and optic disc. After adjustment there was a reduced\ncorrelation between axial length and luminance (Myopes R\n2\n= 0.18, Emmetropes\nR\n2\n= 0.03). We found no significant relationships between recalled childhood\ndiet or outdoor activity.\nConclusion: We demonestreted a modest relationship between lipofuscin accumulation and axial length.\nEither there were no expected relationships between the recalled childhood measures\nand refractive category, or our methods were not sensitive enough to detect the relationships.\nAlso, we noted when quantifying lipofuscin one should consider axial length in the\nraw photograph.","title":"Lipofuscin Accumulation and Refractive Errors Among Healthy Adults","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185244\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        John Hayes\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, the widely used high sampling density\nCOAS HD aberrometer (Wavefront Sciences Inc.) is no longer available. We examined\nthe accuracy and repeatability of a newly developed high sampling density (41µm lens\ndiameter) clinical aberrometer (Osiris, CSO, Italy).\nMethods: Using the Osiris model eye and a dilated presbyopic eye, trial lenses were introduced\n(sphere +12 to -10 D, and astigmatic -4 and -2 D with axis 180, 90 and 45) to calibrate\nassessment of lower order aberrations. Simulated operator errors of axial and lateral\nalignment and patient errors of fixation were evaluated. Repeatability of lower and\nhigher order aberrations (LOA & HOA) was assessed (n = 10) for the model eye without\nrealignment, with the presbyopic model eye with realignment between each measure.\nFive young patient eyes were tested with both Osiris and COAS HD without any correction,\nwith their spectacle correction, and when fit with a single vision and a multifocal\ncontact lens.\nResults: Observed spherical Rx of model and presbyopic eye viewing through a series of spherical\ntrial lenses were on average (Root Mean Square Error, RMSE) within 0.17D of expected.\nLinear models fit to the observed vs. expected plots reveal slopes of 0.985 and 0.97,\nwith intercepts of -0.13D and -0.01D for the model and presbyopic eyes, respectively.\nIn each case R\n2\nexceeded 0.99. Measured RMSE for the cylindrical lens series\nwas 0.011D of power and 0.18 deg of axis error. Repeatability estimates (SD of 10\nrepeat measures) for the model and presbyopic eyes were 0.026D and 0.039D for spherical\nRx. Repeat measures of HOAs were identical for the model eye, and SDs for primary\nspherical aberration, vertical and horizontal coma, and overall higher order aberration\nRMS were 0.013 µm, 0.019 µm, 0.03 µm, and 0.018 µm, respectively. Operator errors\nof focus introduced Rx changes of 0.018 D/mm, while maximum (1.5 mm) alignment errors\nintroduced 0.11D change in sphere estimate. Observer fixation errors (range +/- 6\ndeg) introduced modest changes in LOA & HOA, most significantly, horizontal fixation\nerrors systematically modified horizontal coma. When testing young adult eyes with\na range of refractive corrections Osiris and COAS measurements analyzed over a 5mm\npupil diameter produced highly correlated results with R\n2\n= 0.91, 0.84\nand 0.83, and regression slopes of 0.97, 0.98, and 0.89, respectively, for C\n4\n0\n,\nC\n3\n-1\n, and C\n3\n1\n.\nConclusion: The Osiris clinical aberrometer provided accurate and repeatable measures of spherical\nrefractive error over the -10 to +5 D range and astigmatism up to 4D. Operator-initiated\nalignment errors were <0.1D for LOA and 0.01µm for HOAs. Patient fixation errors\nintroduced modest (<0.25 D) errors in Rx but systematic changes in coma.

The\nprocess for this mechanism is unclear partly because there are no established animal\nmodels for studying the relationship between myopia and the CM. The aim of this study\nwas to determine if defocus induced myopia in the guinea pig results in morphological\nCM changes.\nMethods: Five guinea pigs (Cincinnati strain) were bred from in-house progenitors. Myopia was\ninduced in right eyes by applying -5.0 D defocus lenses for 7 days starting at 2-4\ndays of age. Left eyes served as untreated controls. Refractive error was measured\nby retinoscopy, and axial length was measured by A-scan ultrasound. Animals were then\neuthanized and eyes were collected. Each eye was cut into nasal and temporal halves,\nembedded in optimal cutting temperature compound, and 30 Î¼m sections were collected.\nTwo sections from each eye region were labeled with FITC-conjugated, anti-Î±-smooth\nmuscle actin (SMA) antibody (1:80 dilution; F3777, Sigma) to visualize smooth muscle\nand Draq5 (1:1000 dilution; Thermo Scientific) to identify cell nuclei and were then\nimaged with Axio-Plan2 Fluorescent Microscope and a high-resolution Photometrics Iris\n9 camera (Zeiss). Images were analyzed with Stereo Investigator (MBF Bioscience) to\ndetermine CM cross-sectional area, cell number, and brightness (smooth muscle actin\nconcentration). Mean cell sizes were derived by dividing CM cross-sectional area by\nthe number of cell nuclei detected. Animals were considered responsive if the treated\neye became at least 2.0 D more myopic and at least 0.1 mm longer than the control\neye. Statistical comparisons were made with a Wilcoxon Signed-rank test.\nResults: All included animal were responsive to the treatment as demonstrated by the animals\nhaving a mean between-eye refractive error difference of 4.73 ± 0.80 D and a mean\nvitreous chamber depth difference of 0.14 ± 0.06 mm. On average the animals had (treated\nvs. control) CM cross-sectional areas (0.09 ± 0.02 mm\n2\nvs. 0.11 ± 0.03\nmm\n2\n; p = 0.13), cell numbers (219.9 ± 59.1 cells vs. 214.9 ± 62.6 cells;\np = 0.81), SMA brightness (29.27 ± 3.34 vs. 28.56 ± 3.44; p = 0.19), and mean CM cells\nsizes (396.9 ± 74.9 Î¼m\n2\n/cell vs. 529.46 ± 71.9 Î¼m\n2\n/cell; p =\n0.13) that were not significantly different between eyes.\nConclusion: While preliminary, these data convey that 7 days of exposure to defocus did not result\nin CM hypertrophy. Hyperopic defocus either had no effect or may have induced early\nCM hyperplasia, cellular atrophy, or both.

Pupil responses driven\nby ipRGC input have typically been measured clinically in response to flashes of red\nand blue light following dark adaptation. However, this is not a feasible method for\ntesting children, as dark adaptation adds a significant amount of time to each trial.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of dark adaptation on the pupil\nresponses to red and blue light stimulation.\nMethods: Subjects were 20 adults age 24.0 ± 2.37 years (average ± SD), 55% female, with an\naverage spherical equivalent (SEQ) refractive error of -3.22 ± 2.78 diopters (Grand\nSeiko WR-5100K cycloplegic autorefraction), ranging from -10.61 to +0.77 diopters.\nThe RAPDx pupilometer measured pupil sizes in response to blue and/or red light oscillating\nat a low temporal frequency of 0.1Hz. The standard testing protocol included 5 minutes\nof dark adaptation prior to each of three stimulus conditions: alternating red and\nblue, red-only, then blue-only. Subjects repeated this standard protocol without dark\nadaptation. We also evaluated whether pupil responses might be enhanced by two minutes\nof red-only stimulation (instead of the standard one minute), once with and once without\ndark adaptation. These 4 test conditions were conducted in random order on separate\ndays. The primary outcome measure was the difference in normalized pupil size in response\nto blue-only light compared to blue during the alternating condition.\nResults: Consistent with previous research, pupils tended to become more constricted with repeated\nexposure to blue light. The average difference (±SD) in normalized pupil size between\nblue-only and alternating blue conditions with dark adaptation was 10 ± 2.4%. Without\ndark adaptation, the pupil did not become as constricted with repeated exposure to\nblue light, making the difference not as great: 6.9 ± 3.4% for the standard protocol\nand 8.2 ± 4.3% for the two-minute red condition (p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively).\nPupil responses were not significantly different between these two conditions without\ndark adaptation (p = 0.76), nor between the testing protocols with and without the\nextra minute of red light exposure (p = 0.57).\nConclusion: Dark adaptation resulted in a significant reduction in pupil size in response to blue\nlight. Use of dark adaptation needs to be taken into account during pupillary testing.\nThis effect could be attributed to an increase in the amount of time between light\nexposures allowing dopamine to diffuse throughout the retina and decrease the threshold\nlevels of the retinal cells driving the pupil response.","title":"The Effect of Dark Adaptation on Red and Blue LightDriven Pupil Responses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185233\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lydia Pickrell, Andrew Hartwick, Andrew Hartwick, Donald Mutti, Donald Mutti\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Previous analyses of the efficacy of myopia control interventions have delivered\nresults as percentage or absolute reduction in myopia progression over a given time\nframe. Estimates of longer term efficacy have been constructed around these estimates\nbut fail to account for two important recent observations: (i) myopia control efficacy\ntends to an absolute effect rather than a relative effect across the progression range,\n1\nand (ii) efficacy may decrease over time on both absolute and relative bases.\n2\nHere, we apply the principles of evidence-based medicine to efficacy of myopia control\ninterventions.\nMethods: We systematically reviewed the literature, including relevant peer-reviewed conference\nabstracts, to categorize quality of investigations of a set of myopia control interventions\ncurrently of interest (see Table) based on adherence to evidence-based principles.\nThe only indisputable metric than can be used is data-driven estimates of cumulative\nabsolute reduction in progression rather than absolute annual or relative rates. The\nprimary variable should be reduction in axial elongation because of its assumed relevance\nto disease development but refractive error serves as an important secondary endpoint.\nWe also identified maximum efficacy outcomes of each category of intervention.\nResults: The table shows the classification of 32 identified studies according to quality of\nevidence. Study designs to the left in the table represent more rigorous levels of\nevidence. Despite the popularity of low-dose (0.01%) atropine, there is no direct\nevidence of a reduction in axial elongation with this intervention. Orthokeratology\n(in a cohort study) and spectacles (in a controlled, randomized study with selective\ninclusion criteria) have provided the largest recorded treatment effects. Soft, multizone\nlenses have the greatest weight of evidence but do not demonstrate superior performance\npossibly because of insufficient study periods. Increased time outdoors alone does\nnot provide a large treatment effect but may be a useful adjunct therapy. It should\nbe noted that rebound was not examined in any of studies except for one cohort study\nwith low-dose atropine.\nConclusion: The maximum treatment effect that can currently be supported is 0.43mm for axial elongation\nand 1.05D for refractive error; however, such efficacy may be restricted to a subset\nof patients and rebound cannot be ruled out. Any suggestions of greater potential\nefficacy are speculative and not evidence-based.

Evidence suggests\nthat diurnal patterns of choroidal thickness and axial length may be altered in myopia.\nMyopia typically onsets and progresses during school age. However, diurnal patterns\nof choroidal thickness and axial length have yet to be examined in children. Here,\nwe begin to assess relationships between ocular and systemic diurnal rhythms in children.\nMethods: Young subjects (n = 4, 7-14 yrs) were recruited to wear a light, sleep and activity\nmonitor for one week, after which a series of measurements were recorded every 4 hours\n(h) for 24 h. Subjects were in a dark environment (< 2 lux) from 23:00 to 7:00,\nand otherwise went about their daily activities. At each time point, blood pressure,\nheart rate, body temperature and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured 3 times,\nand 1 ml of saliva was collected and placed in the freezer for later melatonin and\ncortisol analysis. Ocular biometry was measured (LenStar, Haag-Streit) and two spectral\ndomain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT, Spectralis, Heidelberg) images were collected\nusing enhanced depth imaging mode. The scan protocol included six 30° radial scans\ncentered at the fovea. Custom software was used to determine choroidal and retinal\nthicknesses. From blood pressure and IOP, mean ocular perfusion pressure (MOPP) was\ncalculated. For each measure, a cosine function was fitted to the data and acrophase\nand amplitude were determined.\nResults: In this pilot study including 4 children, most parameters evaluated exhibited robust\ndiurnal variations (repeated measures ANOVA). The choroid was thinnest at 12 h and\nthickened throughout the evening and night with a mean change of 17.5 ± 2.1 µm (p\n< 0.001). Changes were in anti-phase to those observed in axial length; however,\ndiurnal variation in axial length did not reach significance (p = 0.15), likely due\nto noise in axial length measures. IOP peaked at 8 h, just after light onset, with\na diurnal variation of 4.6 ± 0.1.8 mmHg (p = 0.05). MOPP peaked at 0 h, just after\nlight offset (p = 0.056). Other robust diurnal patterns observed were in body temperature\n(peak: 20 h, amplitude: 1.4 ± 0.2° F, p < 0.001) and retinal thickness (peak: 12-20\nh, amplitude: 5.6 ± 0.7 µm, p = 0.003).\nConclusion: Diurnal variation in ocular and systemic processes were observed over 24 hours in\nchildren, with each function exhibiting a unique acrophase and relationship with light\nexposure.

Compared to Anterior\nSegment OCT (AS-OCT), the UBM has a greater ability to visualize post-iridian structures\nsuch as the ciliary body and lens. UBM can be a useful tool for diagnosing a plethora\nof conditions such as narrow angles, plateau iris, pupillary block, ciliary body cysts,\nangle trauma, angle closure glaucoma and even finding retained intraocular lens fragments\nbehind the iris. Patients with retained lens fragments often have symptoms of ocular\npain and blurry vision. Upon examination, most patients present with corneal edema,\niritis with cells and flare, increased IOP of greater than 25 mmHg, and in rare cases,\ncystoid macular edema. This case report will discuss the advantages of UBM versus\nAS-OCT, signs and symptoms of retained lens fragments as well as risks, diagnostic\nmethods, treatment and management.\n\nCase Report: A 59-year-old Caucasian male who had Dropless Refractive Lens Exchange surgery OS\nwas referred to our office by his optometrist one month after surgery for high IOP\nof 30 mmHg and 1+ cells in anterior chamber OS. Presenting UCDVA OS was 20/40 with\nIOP of 27 mmHg. Slit lamp examination (SLEx) showed mild temporal corneal edema, slightly\nraised temporal iris with 1+ cells in anterior chamber. Further testing was required.\nAn AS-OCT was performed which did not show any irregular findings. Next, a UBM was\nperformed which showed a retained lens fragment concealed beneath the temporal iris\nOS. An anterior chamber washout with BSS (balance sodium solution) and an antibiotic\nwas then recommended and performed. After successful surgery, the patient was placed\non Pred-Gati-Brom (Prednisolone/ Gatifloxacin/ Bromfenac 1/ 0.5/ 0.075%) 1 gtt TID\nOS and Alphagan-P 0.1% 1 gtt TID OS. On his 1 day post-op, patient's UCDVA was 20/60\nwith IOP of 11 mmHg OS. SLEx showed trace corneal edema and a flat iris with no cells\nor flare OS. Upon the 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month post-op examinations, the patient\ncontinued to experience 20/20 UCDVA with normal IOPs ranging from 10-12 mmHg OS.\nConclusion: Due to an upsurge in viable technology options, refractive surgery has significantly\nevolved over the years. Although the incidence of retained lens fragments varies from\n0.3% to 1.1%, it is still important for co-managing optometrists and refractive surgeons\nto be aware of the signs, symptoms, various diagnostic methods and treatment options\nbased on where the fragment settles. UBM testing can greatly aid doctors in finding\nthese sometimes hidden fragments and ultimately, allow for a higher standard of patient\ncare.","title":"A Curious Case of a Hidden Intraocular Lens Fragment Found Solely via Ultrasound Biomicroscopy  UBM","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185228\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dougherty Laser Vision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Monica Youcefi, Brooke Randolph\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Reingold Eye Center, Dougherty Laser Vision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Lens transmittance was obtained with a Multiskan GO spectrophotometer\n(Thermo Scientific). Photo-biological relative changes are defined as one minus the\nintegration by wavelength of transmittance weighted by the photo-biological function,\ndivided by the integration by wavelength of the photo-biological function. Phototoxicity,\nscotopic sensitivity and suppression of melatonin were calculated from the blue-light\nhazard, scotopic luminous efficiency, and circadian efficiency functions, respectively,\nin combination with the measured spectral transmission functions. (2) Four\nsoft contact lenses with UV protection, \"Avaira\" (-3.5D; Cooper Vision), \"Enficon\"\n(-3.75D; Cooper Vision), \"Acuvue-Oasys\" (-3.75D; Alcon) and \"Acuvue-Adv.\" (-3.75D;\nAlcon) were measured with a NanoDrop One UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).\nUV phototoxicity of the contact lenses was calculated from the measured contact-lens\ntransmittance and the UV hazard function. This function describes approximately the\nrelative spectral risk for photokeratitis.\nResults: (1) All spectacle lenses almost completely blocked UVA (320 to 400nm) and UVB\n(290 to 320nm), but two of them transmitted more than 10% between 380-400nm. However,\nthese spectacles had better performance in the blue region (400-500nm). Interestingly,\nall spectacle lenses reduce a large amount of purple light (~405nm), but transmit\nmore than 50% around blue (~450nm). In summary, blue-light filtering spectacle lenses\nreduced the calculated phototoxicity by 44% to 64%. However, reduction in blue-light\ntransmission sacrificed 19%-33% of light sensitivity in a low-light (scotopic) environment\nand caused a decrease in melatonin suppression efficiency of 17%- 31%. (2)\nThe soft contact lenses had a transmittance of 4% across the UV region (200-400nm)\nand a 96% in visible wavelengths (400-700nm). The contact lenses reduced the calculated\nphototoxicity by 95% to 99%.\nConclusion: Blue-light spectacles can substantially reduce UV light, which has photo-biological\nbenefits. However, their transmittance in the blue-light region (400-460nm) was not\nhigh. We suggest that blue-light-filtering spectacle lenses could be improved by increased\ntransmission of blue light without losing other important photobiological properties.\nAlternatively, the contact lenses reduced the UV hazard by 95 to 99%, which is congruent\nwith the advertising of these contact lenses as providing UV protection.","title":"Assessment of the Potential Reduction in Photochemical Retinal Damage from BlueLightFiltering  Spectacles and Contact Lenses with UV Protection","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185229\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Autonomous University of Sinaloa\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Pablo de Gracia, CuauhtÃ©moc Reyes, Edith Cuevas, Erick Urias-Bernal, Rosalio Ramos-PayÃ¡n, Rosalia Ramirez-Jaimes, Carlos Martinez-Gaytan, Ivan Camacho\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Chicago College of Optometry, Autonomous University of Sinaloa, Autonomous University of Sinaloa, Autonomous University of Sinaloa, Autonomous University of Sinaloa, Autonomous University of Sinaloa, Autonomous University of Sinaloa, Autonomous University of Sinaloa\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

They were known as fast progressor (>0.50D\n/year) with normal binocular vision (AC/A, lag, phoria at near). All had been wearing\nregular monofocal glasses before the study. Subjects were seen at baseline and after\n1, 6, 7 and 12 months.\nParticipants were randomly fitted on one eye with a lathe-cut\nsoft bifocal lens (L1), with a central zone correcting the refractive error at distance,\nsurrounded by a +5.00D add power zone customized in width to each subject. The fellow\neye was fitted with a spherical monofocal lens (L2), made of a similar material (Benz\n55, Blanchard Labs, Sherbrooke), serving as a control. After 6 months, lenses were\ncrossed-over. Clinical testing included binocular vision testing, pupillometry (Neuroptics),\ncorneal topography (Oculus Pentacam) high contrast visual acuity at distance (C Landolt),\ncycloplegic auto-refraction (Topcon), axial length (Lenstar), high order aberrations\nmeasurement (iTrace, Clarion) and ocular health assessment under slit lamp.\nResults: 21 subjects ended the study (3 drop-outs). 3 were excluded for non-compliance (minimal\nhours or days of lens wear). The remaining population is composed of 10 girls and\neight boys (10.5 + 1.2 y.o), 78% Caucasians and 22% Asian. At baseline, L1\nwas -3.44 + 1.40 D and L2 -3.29 + 1.26 D, evolving by -0.13 + 0.24 D (L!) and\n-0.31 + 0.33 D (L2) at 6 months, This is a statistically significant difference\n(F=35.104; p<0.01), representing 60% efficacy if projected at 1 year.

Indeed, in certain parts\nof Asia, interventions for myopia control are routinely prescribed. Awareness of the\navailable myopia control strategies among parents of myopic children, however, remains\nunknown. In this study, we sought to investigate the awareness of myopia control methods\namong such parents and in particular, to determine the contribution, if any, of eye\ncare practitioners in discussing options for myopia control.\nMethods: An online survey was circulated to parents of myopic children via email and social\nmedia platforms. The survey included a questionnaire on the demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics of parents and children, parent's perception of the presence of myopia\nin their children and awareness of available myopia control methods.\nResults: Responses involved parents from 6 countries - United States (49%), United Kingdom\n(19%), Ireland (20%), India (6%), Canada (5%) and Saudi Arabia (1%). In total, 85\nparents completed the online survey. The mean ± SD age of the parents was 38 ± 7.6\nyears.\nThe majority of parents (64%) reported that they haven't been informed\nof any myopia treatment strategies by their eye care professionals. A similar proportion\nof parents (68%) reported that they were unaware of any myopia control or prevention\nmethods.

The purpose of this study was\nto test the hypothesis the area of UVAF will be equal between temporal and nasal regions,\nand between right and left eyes of contact lens wearers, during wear of and following\ncontact lens removal of UV-absorbing and non-UV absorbing materials.\n\nMethods: Eighteen participants were included in this cross-sectional study; only those with\nevident UVAF from our prior study were included. This study examined three groups;\nUV-absorbing contact lens wearers (Johnson & Johnson Vision Care\n®\n) (n=7),\nnon-UV-absorbing contact lens wearers (Alcon\n®\n) (n=7), and non-contact lens\nwearers (n=4). Ocular sun exposure was calculated using self-reported measures. Conjunctival\nUVAF images were obtained using a Nikon D7000 camera system adapted with appropriate\nflash and filter system. Images were acquired of temporal and nasal conjunctiva. For\ncontact lens wearing participants, images were captured while wearing lenses, and\nagain following lens removal. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software. For each\nimage, the area of UVAF was measured thrice with the average used in calculations.\nComparison of UVAF area was made for OD and OS, and for nasal and temporal regions.\n\nResults: No significant differences in age (p=0.25), gender (p=0.65), or ocular sun exposure(p=0.76)\nwere present between groups. Temporal area of UVAF was non-normally distributed, with\nnormal distribution of nasal UVAF (Shapiro-Wilk). For contact lens wearers compared\nwith non-lens wearers, area of conjunctival UVAF was found significantly greater between\nright and left eyes (p=0.04 Alcon\n®\n, p=0.01 JJVC\n®\n), and between\nnasal (p=0.046 Alcon\n®\n, p=0.01 JJVC\n®\n), and temporal (p=0.01 JJVC\n®\n)\nareas, yet no difference was found between contact lens wearers of the two different\ngroups. Nasal and temporal UVAF was then evaluated for the entire set of data (Mann-Whitney\nU); no difference was found between nasal and temporal regions during contact lens\nwear (p=0.28) or after lens removal (p=0.16).\nConclusion: Conjunctival UVAF was found statistically equivalent between nasal and temporal regions,\nand between right and left eyes for UV-absorbing and non-UV-absorbing contact lens\nwearers, both during lens wear and after lens removal.

Procedures were performed consistently in the same sequence and were\nbalanced to avoid inter-testing contamination. First, the OSDI questionnaire was completed\nin Spanish, the Zone Quick was performed OS, InflammaDry done OD and lastly TBUT was\ncompleted OS. Statistical analysis was done based on gender and correlation between\nthe various subjective and objective techniques.\nResults: A total of 59 men and 118 women completed all the tests.

An improved design and postoperative management\nhave led to longer retention rates, fewer complications and overall better outcomes.\nMany patients complain of significant glare and visual dysfunction despite improved\nvisual acuity. This issue motivated us to objectively measure light scatter in eyes\nwith KPro devices.\nMethods: Light scatter was measured using OCULUS C-Quant device (Arlington, WA). The amount\nof scatter was compared between 21 eyes with Boston KPro Type 1 and VA of 20/150 or\nbetter to 13 healthy control eyes. The measurements were repeated at more than one\nvisit. Scatter measurements were also repeated on 11 eyes with Boston KPro Type 1\nusing a black iris occluder Orion Prosthetic contact lens(Orion Vision Group, Marietta,\nGA). The contact lens was polymacon 38% material, plano power, base curve 8.6, diameter\n14.3, 12.25 black occluder iris with a 5.0mm clear pupil.\nResults: The mean age of the KPro group was 55.5 years and 53.6 years for the control group.\nMean VA was 0.47 logMAR and 0.00 logMAR for the KPro and control group respectively.\nIntraocular light scatter was found to be significantly higher in patients with KPro\ncompared to healthy control subjects (logS values of 2.34 ± 0.15 and 1.29 ± 0.17 respectively,\np<0.01). Light scatter in eyes with PMMA KPro devices (logS 2.49 ± 0.19; n=16)\nwas higher than in eyes with titanium KPro devices (logS 1.87 ± 0.15; n=5). The LogS\nvalue was significantly lower for eyes with PMMA backplate KPro devices fit with iris\noccluder prosthetic lens (1.71 vs 2.42, P = < 0.05; n=11).\nConclusion: Glare is a common complaint by many patients with KPro devices. Light scatter measured\nin this study showed significantly higher values in eyes with KPro devices compared\nto healthy eyes. Possibly due to its opaque nature, the titanium backplate model appears\nto produce less light scatter than PMMA backplate model. Prosthetic contact lenses\nmay serve a role to reduce light scatter in individuals with KPro devices and should\nbe considered as an option for symptomatic patients.","title":"Intraocular Light Scatter in Eyes with Boston Type 1 Keratoprosthesis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185217\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Faras Karas, Andrea Arteaga, Pablo Barrionuevo, Dingcai Cao, Jason McAnany, Maria Cortina\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Inhalation of chlorine can have systemic effects to organs other than\nlung. The purpose of this study is to report the effect of nebulized chlorine or its\nmetabolic byproducts on the ocular surface including conjunctiva and cornea in an\nexperimental sheep model.\nMethods: Female sheep (60 kg) were divided into sham and chlorine groups (n = 6/group). At\n48 h after chlorine nebulization sheep were humanely sacrificed and whole eyes were\nremoved and fixed in Davidson's fixative. Both cornea and conjunctiva were dissected\nand processed for embedding, sectioning and immunohistochemical staining. Quantitation\nfor significance was done using an ImagePro software.\nResults: Both cornea and conjunctiva of the sheep showed morphological changes after chlorine\nnebulization. Microscopic evaluation of Hematoxylin/Eosin slides showed increased\nepithelial and stromal disruption in the ocular surface tissue in chlorine treated\nanimals compared to the shams. Quantitative image analysis of IHC slides of the conjunctiva\nshowed a 66% significant (p= 0.031) increase in epithelial MMP-2 labeling (46.5 ±\n5.56 SEM) compared to sham (27.8 ± 4.7). Conjunctival goblet cells were identified\nby PAS stain and further quantitated by MUC5B expression using IHC. Number of goblet\ncells positive for MMP-9 and MUC5B immunolabeling was significantly (p = 0.002) increased,\ncounting 5 microscopic fields at 40X (10 and 56 ± 7 for sham and injured respectively).\nIncreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 suggest a role of these metalloproteinase in chlorine induced\ninjury to the conjunctiva.\nConclusion: We have identified that chorine nebulization injury caused adverse effects on the\nocular surface tissue perhaps through a systemic inflammatory response. Future studies\nare warranted to better understand the pathway that is involved in remote organ injury\nafter chorine nebulization insults.","title":"Effect of Chlorine Nebulization on Sheep Ocular Surface tissue","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185218\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Texas Medical Branch\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ravena Jacob, Karel Capek, Stephan Trocme, Andrew Salzman, Robert Cox, Perenlei Enkhbaatar\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Incarnation Word, Shriners Hospital, Shriners Hospital, Radikal Therapeutics, Shriners Hospital, Shriners Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

To\ndate, precise measurements of the limbal dimensions are lacking. The purpose of this\npreliminary study was to enhance the current understanding of the corneo-limbal-scleral\ninterfaces by identifying, defining, and measuring the central and peripheral extremes\nof the limbus with the trabecular meshwork using advanced microscopy.\nMethods: Whole human eyes (n=3) obtained from a US eye bank were bisected along the equatorial\nmeridian and placed in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde fixative within 48 hours of death. Smaller\npieces of tissue suitable for electron microscopy were prepared following an established\nhistological protocol. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy\n(TEM), light microscopy (LM), and serial block face (Gatan) microscopy were used to\nidentify and measure the limits of the cornea and limbus using ImageJ software.\nResults: The limbal width was unequal when measured along the anterior and posterior surfaces\nand the angle recess was strictly a uveal feature and not part of limbus. Furthermore,\nthe scleral spur, although intimately related to limbal tissues, was clearly part\nof the scleral anatomy. The terminations of the anterior and posterior limiting laminae\nproved to be reasonable anatomical reference points for the central extremes of limbus.\nThe peripheral limit of the trabecular meshes and the central extreme of the palisades\nof Vogt best defined the posterior and anterior, peripheral extremes of limbus. Using\nthe outlined reference points for posterior limbal width on 2 eyes from 2 separate\nindividuals measured 695 and 690 µ.\nConclusion: Most anatomical studies do not describe a difference between the anterior and posterior\nlimbal widths but in a few instances a wider anterior than posterior surface was proposed\nwithout photographic evidence. Our preliminary measurements are noteworthy because\nthey represent roughly ½ to 2/3 of the typically stated limbal width in the anatomical\nliterature. It follows that the shape of the limbus is like a wedge and that for the\nSL practitioner the anterior width will be the most important dimension, which has\nyet to be determined using reference points.","title":"Redefining the Limbus with the Use of 2D and 3D Imaging","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185219\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Alan Burns, Jan Bergmanson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Universit© de Montr©al's (UM)\npharmacy program prepares students for these types of situations by providing didactic\n(9hrs) and hands-on internships (11 months) in various hospitals/community pharmacies.\nHowever, much less time is dedicated to natural health products, such as ocular nutraceuticals\nfor age related macular degeneration (ARMD) and dry eye disease (DED). Therefore,\nthis study examined the familiarity of pharmacy students with ocular nutraceuticals\nand their comfort at recommending them.\nMethods: An anonymous 35 question survey (Survey Monkey) was sent (March 2018) to graduating\nUM pharmacy students. The survey was also sent to 1\nst\nyear students, who\nhad not yet completed any ocular courses nor internships. Questions included general\nuse of nutraceuticals, specifics of omega-3s for DED, vitamins for ARMD and the student's\ncomfort at recommending these products.\nResults: A total of 78 (46F;29M;1Other) graduating students took the survey and 61 completed\n(34%-class size 179). Similarly, 88 (67F;20M;1Other) 1\nst\nyear students\nresponded to the survey and 76 completed (38%-class size 199). Graduating students\nwere more familiar with the benefits of nutraceuticals in the heart (81%) and in the\neye (84%) as compared to 1\nst\nyr (42% and 60%, respectively). The majority\nof graduating students (92% vs 1\nst\nyr 23%) identified nutraceuticals as\na benefit for ARMD but not as many for DED (graduating: 35%, 1\nst\nyr: 31%).\nMost graduates were able to recognize AREDS (73%) and AREDS2 (78%) as key studies\nin ARMD as compared to 96% of 1\nst\nyr who were unaware of such studies.\nMost graduating students (75%) reported to be uncomfortable at recommending nutraceuticals\nfor the retina. Of those, 33% reported being \"very uncomfortable\". Most (graduating:\n63%, 1\nst\nyr: 87%) were not able to identify: key nutrients needed for DED;\nsupporting studies (graduating: 81%, 1\nst\nyr: 100%) or omega -3 dosages\n(graduating: 87%, 1\nst\nyr: 89%).

Although the UM pharmacy's curriculum has provided a forum for interdisciplinary\ncollaboration, graduating students remain uncomfortable at recommending ocular nutraceuticals.\nThis study can serve as the foundation for inter-professional collaboration between\noptometry and pharmacy to complement the existing curriculum and enhance the education\non nutraceuticals, especially for DED.","title":"Exploring Pharmacy Students Familiarity with Ocular Nutraceuticals","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185220\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ecole d 'Optometrie, Universite de Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Isabel Tom\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

It is important to develop an optical imaging system to use Scandium (Sc)\ndoped Silicon (Si) QDs and assess their detection limit using it to study tear film.\nQDs were also assessed for their cytotoxicity for safe application in eyes. QDs are\nsemiconductor nanocrystals of varying size (2-100nm) with bright and stable fluorescence\nspectrum which renders them optimal for bioimaging.\nMethods: Hydrophilic (propylamine- terminated) and hydrophobic (cyclohexane-terminated) Sc\ndoped Si QDs were investigated for fluorescence by exposing to artificial tears (a\nbalanced electrolyte formula for dry eye therapy). An optical imaging system composed\nof a standard slit-lamp bio-microscope combined with a high-resolution Zyla sCOMS\ncamera, was used with emission filters of 460 nm, 510 nm and 530 nm for in-vitro imaging.\nCytotoxicity of the Sc doped Si QDs was assessed using cultured fibroblasts L929 and\ncell death by light microscopy after exposure to the QDs for 24 hours respectively.\nResults: During in-vitro imaging no fluorescence signal was detected with artificial tears\n(control). However, when artificial tears were instilled with Sc doped Si QDs, the\nfluorescence signal was clearly detected. The fluorescence of the QDs was detected\neven at low concentration of 1Î¼g/ml with volume of 10Î¼l. Fluorescence signal can be\nclearly seen in attached image at concentration of 1Î¼g/ml and100Î¼g/ml. Fluorescence\nwas greater in dilute QDs as compared to concentrated ones.

These children\nare significantly more likely to exhibit health and behavioral problems than children\nnot in foster care. Specifically, they have a higher prevalence of developmental disorders,\nblindness/vision defects, attention deficit disorder, and many other physical and\nmental health conditions. The purpose of this study is to compare and contrast eye\ncare requirements for children in foster care across the United States.\nMethods: The healthcare requirements for children in foster care were gathered from all\n50 states via internet and telephone.

The ratio of subjects\nbeing classed as borderline or failing the required standard can be seen to increase\nsignificantly with age from the fifth decade onwards. Prior to this age the ratio\nis static apart from a reduction in failure rates in the fourth decade. This can likely\nbe attributed to emmetropic presbyopes attending primary eye care for the first time.\nThe increase in the number of failing and borderline subjects is of particular concern\nas this demonstrates a problem with the existing licensing system which facilitates\ndrivers on the road who do not meet the basic vision standard and therefore indicates\nan urgent need for policy reform.\nConclusion: Privately held data sources have untapped potential for ophthalmic epidemiological\nstudies which in turn can help inform policy decisions. This data indicates that the\nage at which there is a requirement for a vision assessment for drivers should be\nlowered and the frequency of assessments increased.","title":"Big Data and Driving Using Pooled Practice Data to Guide Health Policy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185209\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dublin Institute of Technology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        James Loughman, Ian Flitcroft\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The etiology is believed to be osmotic in nature due to increased\nsorbitol accumulation within the lens during times of hyperglycemia and subsequent\nhypertonicity of the lens relative to the aqueous humor once blood glucose levels\ndecrease. The opacities are reversible with timely control of blood glucose levels.\nIn almost all cases, these cataracts are described as white punctate or stellate opacities\nin the anterior or posterior subcapsular region. A single report describes a case\nof transient diabetic cataract appearing in a fingerprint-like pattern in the adult\nnucleus. A second case of a reversible, nuclear \"˜fingerprint' cataract secondary to\nextreme hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia is presented. This presentation may be more\ncommon than the literature suggests.\n\nCase Report: A 69-year-old black female presented to the emergency eye service with a complaint\nof blurred vision through habitual correction. Medical history was pertinent for a\nnewly prescribed diabetic medication to address severe hyperglycemia. Habitual distance\nacuity was reduced and a hyperopic shift was suspected. Pinhole acuity achieved 20/20\nOD and OS and dilated examination revealed no significant lenticular opacities or\ndiabetic retinopathy. Follow up evaluation 2 weeks later confirmed a 2 diopter hyperopic\nshift and best corrected visual acuity of only 20/30 OD and 20/50 OS. Dilated evaluation\nrevealed a fingerprint-like central opacity in the nucleus of the crystalline lens\nin each eye. At this exam, the patient reported recent discontinuation of the diabetic\nmedication due to extreme hypoglycemia. Subsequent follow up over the next 10 weeks\nshowed a gradual return to baseline refraction and 20/20 acuity with almost complete\nresolution of the fingerprint lens opacity in each eye. Systemically, tighter blood\nglucose control had been achieved during this time.\nConclusion: Reports of extreme blood glucose fluctuations and patient complaints of blur after\ninitiation of treatment for hyperglycemia are not uncommon, yet there is only a single\ncase report of a transient, nuclear fingerprint-like cataract in the literature. A\nsimilar pattern of opacity has been observed in a mouse model. In both this case and\nthat reported in the literature, the timing of the cataract trailed the initial complaint\nof reduced acuity. The \"˜fingerprint' cataract may occur more frequently than what\nis reported due to the offset timing of refractive and cataractous lenticular changes.\nRecognizing this presentation and understanding that this is a reversible process\nis important for proper patient care.","title":"Reversible ˜Fingerprint Cataract Due to Extreme Fluctuations in Blood Glucose","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185210\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

In most cases,\nthere is no systemic involvement. Infrequently, ocular findings such as cataracts,\nglaucoma, and keratopathy secondary to limbal stem cell deficiency can occur. Aniridia-associated\nkeratopathy (AAK) is caused by abnormal differentiation of stem cells and impaired\nhealing of epithelial cells in the cornea leading to a host of complications from\nocular surface disease to pancorneal vascularization, keratinization and ulceration.\nAAK has an incidence of 20% and has the potential to cause sight-threatening complications,\nand typically occurs in the teenage years. While there is a genetic link to aniridia,\nthe manifestations can vary from generation to generation. As a clinician, proper\nidentification, diagnosis, and education is essential to reduce the risk and extent\nof permanent vision loss.\n\nCase Report: An 11 year old female with previously diagnosed congenital aniridia presented to the\nLow Vision clinic at the SUNY College of Optometry University Eye Center for an evaluation.\nHer chief complaint consisted of difficulty seeing the board at school and minor irritation\nof her left eye, which started a few weeks ago. BCVA was 20/100 OU. Low vision examination,\nincluding ADL history, refraction, and functional testing was non-contributory. Ocular\nhealth examination revealed a large, central corneal ulcer encompassing the visual\naxis OS with severe limbal stem cell deficiency characterized by peripheral corneal\nhaze and significant neovascularization OU.

He sought care two weeks prior at a different clinic due to progressive\nworsening vision OS over the course of two months. His ocular history was remarkable\nfor bilateral mild myopia and mild cataracts last observed two years ago. The patient's\nmedical history is significant for history of bladder cancer in remission for the\npast 15 years and chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. Best corrected visual acuities\nmeasured 20/20 OD and improved from 20/400 to 20/80 OS after refraction. A significant\nnew astigmatic correction of 5.75 diopters was observed in the left eye. Exophthalmometry\nand other confrontation testing including pupils and confrontation fields were normal.\nSlit lamp exam of the right eye was remarkable for mild nuclear sclerosis and quiet,\ndeep, open anterior chambers. The left eye's slit lamp exam revealed dilated episcleral\nvessels on the temporal aspect of the bulbar conjunctiva, mild 2+ nuclear sclerosis,\nand narrower angles of 2/2 by Van Herrick OS. Applanation intraocular pressures measured\n16/16 mmHg at 8:37 AM. Gonioscopy was unoccludable. Dilated examination was unremarkable\nOD.

As a normal component of tears,\nit has been observed to be dysregulated in dry eye disease. Investigations in other\nmucosal surfaces predict the possibility that Gp340 modulates ocular surface immunity,\ninflammation or infection. To explore the potential roles of Gp340 in tears and on\nthe ocular surface, there is the need to quantitate the expression of Gp340 in tears.\nThe purpose of this study was to quantify tear Gp340 using an indirect fluorescent\nELISA method.\nMethods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Alabama\nat Birmingham. Using the glass microcapillary tube colection method, non-reflex tear\nsamples of up to 10 µl were obtained from the right eye of five normal subjects who\nconsented to be part of the study. All five tear samples were pooled and stored at\n-80 °C until further analysis. For indirect fluorescent ELISA, three wells of a 96-well\nNunc Maxisorp® plate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were each coated with 100 µl\nof tears diluted in the bicarbonate buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. In order\nto produce a standard curve for Gp340 quantitation, different concentrations (8000\n- 0 ng/ml) of recombinant SRCR1 domain of Gp340 were run in triplicates alongside\nthe tear samples. The wells were washed and blocked with PBS-1% BSA and incubated\nfor 2 hours at room temperature and thereafter subjected to washing. Each well was\nprobed with 100 µl of primary anti-Gp340 antibody, incubated for 2 hours at room temperature\nand washed again. The wells were then probed with 100 µl of Alexa 488-conjugated IgG\nsecondary antibody and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The wells were then\nwashed and the fluorescence was recorded using a fluorescence plate reader. Using\nthe data, a standard curve was first plotted to determine the linear working range\nof the assay and subsequently, a log calibration curve was plotted using the data\nfor the linear working range. The concentration of tear Gp340 and the detection limit\nof the assay were determined using the log calibration function.\nResults: Plotting fluorescence versus concentration for the working range of the assay yielded\nthe log function, y = 158.87 In(x) - 467.32, R\n2\n= 0.9949. Using the log\ncalibration function, the concentration of the pooled tear sample was determined to\nbe 619.93 ng/ml. The limit of blank (LoB) and the limit of detection (LoD) of the\nassay were 108.22 ng/ml and 115.24 ng/ml, respectively.\nConclusion: Results from the study show tear Gp340 can be quantified by the indirect fluorescent\nELISA using the recombinantly expressed SRCR domain of Gp340 as standard. The amount\nof tear Gp340 that adsorbs to the wells of the 96-well plate is the determining factor\nin this assay.","title":"Quantitation of Gp340 in Tears Using Indirect Fluorescent ELISA","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185214\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Champion Deivanayagam, Jason Nichols\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The three techniques were A) direct\npulling of the lash; B) rotating the lash using the Mastrota technique prior to epilation;\nC) Sliding the CD away from the base of the lash, followed by the Mastrota rotation\nthen epilation. Lashes were epilated by two researchers who were blinded to the mite\ncount procedure. The order of the techniques and which eye was first were randomized.\nA separate person, blinded to the technique used to epilate, determined the mite count.\nResults: Forty (n=40) participants (20 M: 20 F) with a mean age of 62.3 ± 17.1 years (range\n23 to 85) participated in the study. There was no significant difference in mite count\nbetween the right and left eyes (p=0.63). Similarly, there was no significant interaction\nbetween the technique used and the eye tested (p=0.33). The mite count for techniques\nA, B and C were 1.05±1.60, 1.76±1.80, and 1.36±1.49, respectively with a significant\ndifference (p=0.029) between them. A repeated contrast post-hoc analysis revealed\ntechnique B (Mastrota rotation) yielded a significantly higher mite count compared\nto the other techniques (p=0.017).\nConclusion: Mite count is important in establishing a diagnosis of Demodex f. and to follow\nthe effectiveness of a treatment. This study revealed that rotating the lash using\nthe Mastrota rotation technique before epilation yielded the highest mite count. This\nstudy demonstrates that the lash epilation technique does, in fact, have an influence\non the subsequent mite count and should be described and reported in future studies.","title":"Comparison of Eyelash Epilation Techniques for the Purposes of Demodex Folliculorum  Mite Counts","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185215\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ecole d'Optometrie, Universite de Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Camille Fodi, Etty Bitton\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ecole d'Optometrie, Universite de Montreal, Ecole d 'Optometrie, Universite de Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The tests were conducted in the following order: Korb-Blackie\n(KB) lid seal test, lipid layer thickness (LLT) (LipiView II Ocular Surface Interferometer,\nJohnson & Johnson, Inc.), meibomian gland function (Meibomian Gland Evaluator, Johnson\n& Johnson, Inc.), Marx's line evaluation of the lower lids, meibography of the lower\nlids (Johnson & Johnson, Inc. or Keratograph 5M, Oculus, Inc.) and Standard Patient\nEvaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED). The percentage of visible dilated glands and atrophic\nglands were determined and descriptive statistics were calculated. Evaluation of meibography\nimages was performed by a masked investigator.\nResults: Sixty six percent of the patients had a positive KB light test indicating poor lid\nseal, and 20% of those subjects reported morning symptoms of dryness. The average\nLLT was 65.77nm (stdev 24.08nm). The average number of glands yielding liquid secretion\nper lid was 6.72 (stdev 1.602). Thirty nine percent of subjects had an anterior progression\nof Marx's line. The average number of subjects exhibiting gland dilation was 52% (stdev\n27%, range 0-100%) and the average number of subjects with any gland atrophy was 44%\n(stdev 32%, range 0-100%). Thirty nine percent of subjects had gland dropout (range\n0-12 glands). The average SPEED score was 9.54 (stdev 4.89, range 0-20).\nConclusion: This pilot study of patients with keratoconus demonstrated that a large majority had\npoor lid seal and that meibomian gland dysfunction is common. Whether they are at\nmore or less risk than age and duration of contact lens use matched patients without\nkeratoconus is unknown. The results suggest that further, multi-center investigations\nare warranted to determine risk factors for developing MGD and poor lid seal in this\npopulation. Because keratoconus patients must rely on a lifetime of contact lens use,\nour data suggest that evaluation of lid seal and meibomian gland health for patients\nwith keratoconus should be considered a part of their ongoing care.","title":"Prevalence of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction and Lagophthalmos in Patients with Keratoconus","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185216\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Korb & Associates; Korb Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jennifer Harthan, Andrew McLeod\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, Korb & Associates\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

A total of\n200 students were divided into small groups of 4-6, each with representation from\nthe four health professions and with a faculty member facilitator. Rubrics were developed\nto include the four IPE core competencies- values and ethics for IPE practice, roles/responsibilities,\nIPE communication, and teams and teamwork (Figure 1). Students had 90 minutes to conduct\na thorough evaluation and develop a comprehensive management plan. This was followed\nby a debriefing session led by a faculty member.\nResults: The rubric analysis shows that the students, at minimum, satisfactorily achieved competency\nin all four IPE competencies, where values and ethics for IPE practice had the greatest\npercentage of students exceeding the benchmark for passing. In fact, 55.3% of students\ndemonstrated outstanding relationships with individuals of other professions and appeared\nexperienced/seasoned in their interactions. The Roles and Responsibilities competency\nhad the lowest percentage of students exceeding benchmarks at an impressive 48.7%.\nThis suggests that almost half of the students actively sought to understand the roles/responsibilities\nand knowledge of individuals in other professions.\nConclusion: Overall, the students met our expectations with regard to IPE core competencies.

Having a school in a state has the potential within\na state to raise awareness of the profession as well as outside the state attract\nnew students to the state who then may stay to work. Additionally, as all training\ninstitutions also provide clinical care to the patients in their region, they may\nhave a positive effect on the care within the local area of the school. However, for\nthe school to have a broader, long-term effect for the care of patients across the\nstate, graduates of the program must remain in the state following their schooling.\nThe purpose of the current project was to explore the tendency of individuals to either\nwork within or leave the state of their educational institution.\nMethods: De-identified data was collected from university alumni records or optometric professional\nassociations. Zip codes from these databases were then associated with their state\nof location. This state location was then compared to the state location of the school.\nPercentage of students with in-state status for each school was established from the\nASCO published entering class data for the graduating classes of the years 2014 to\n2017 (assuming a 4-year program). Differences in the percentage of entering to graduating\nin- and out-of-state students were calculated to approximate the total percentage\ngain or loss in in-state students who became practitioners within the same state in\nwhich they were educated. Additionally, distance between optometry school zip code\nand current address zip code was calculated using geocoding and trigonometry of geographical\ncoordinates.\nResults: Across 21 ASCO member institutions approximately the same number of students who attend\nschool in the same state of their pre-school residence, stay to work in that same\nstate (median 0%, mean -1%). While one school, retained an additional 24% of its graduates,\nanother school had a loss of 31% of its graduating optometrists who originally were\nin-state. On average, however, an optometry graduate moves 508.77 miles (±175 miles)\naway from their educating institution.\nConclusion: These results neglect several factors including, students from a state going out-of-state\nto another school and any increase in interest in optometry as a result of school\nlocation, as well as state size and current distribution of already practicing practitioners.\nHowever, on average, school location within a state has a mean neutral response on\nincreasing the number of practitioners within that state.","title":"Do Practitioners with Optometry Training within a State Stay to Practice within that  State","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185201\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Dawn Meyer, Olivia Reed, Pete Kollbaum\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University, School of Optometry, Indiana University, School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

They also have greater temporal convenience\nthan primary care office settings, which often have delineated hours, schedules filled\nin advance and lack of flexibility to allow additional appointments. This health care\nsetting has grown worldwide. Several studies have surveyed the use of hospital\nbased emergency departments by patients with ocular injury. However, very little is\nknown about the demographics, reasons and outcomes of patients presenting to UCC with\nsuch injuries.\nThis study describes the demographics and etiology of corneal and\nconjunctival injuries (CCI) presenting to UCC and risk factors for subsequent ED referral.\nMethods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. The setting\nis a nationwide UCC system, which had 17 branches at the time of the study. Electronic\nMedical Record (EMR) data (between Nov 1, 2015 and Oct 31, 2016) was downloaded anonymously\nfrom the UCC database, with the diagnosis of eye injury, foreign body in eye or ocular\ndisorder. As a control for CCI, data was downloaded from all patients presenting to\nUCC during the same period. Data included gender, age, chief complaint, diagnosis,\ntreatment, discharge status and date. All CCI records were reviewed and International\nClassification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes were assigned to each. For\ncomparison, data on all patients presenting to ED in Israel was collected from a public\nreport of the State of Israel Ministry of Health Information Division, which included\nprevalence of patients with eye injury according to age group. Data were analysed\nby descriptive statistics, Z-proportion test and logistic regression analyses.\nResults: Of study patients, 4797 presented with CCI (0.8%) with an average age of 32.6 ±18.2\nyears (71.3% men). Of these, 26.4% were referred to the ED, compared to only 6.8%\nfor overall UCC patients. Foreign body of the eye (FB) was the most common ICD-9 code\n(56.5%), followed by trauma, chemical in the eye and contact lens related injury.\nLogistic regression analyses showed the following risk factors for ED referral: age\n(22-64), male gender, foreign body (FB), work related injury and the presence of a\nclinical abrasion in the eye.\nConclusion: Most CCI can be treated at UCC, emphasizing the importance of this mode of health\ncare delivery.

However, little\nis known about this population in Quebec. In 2017, the University of Montreal (UM)\nSchool of optometry implemented a mobile community clinic, Regard collectif\n(RC). It aims to provide quality eye care to the homeless, while filling the gap in\nophthalmic epidemiology for this population and giving optometry students the opportunity\nto acquire competencies relative to caring for marginalized patients. This presentation\naims to report results of the clinical and teaching activities of the RC clinic in\nits first year of operations.\nMethods: A retrospective chart review was performed. RC clinical records were developed by\nadapting elements from epidemiological studies data collection forms and also gather\ndata on social determinants of health. Patient consent for future use of data is systematically\ncollected. An elective three-hour course is offered to students on providing care\nto the homeless and fourth year students attend a minimum of 6 hours in the RC clinic\nduring their in-house rotations. Qualitative student feedback was collected by semi-structured\nverbal and written questionnaires after the training and the clinical rotations.\nResults: In the first eight months of operations, 20 clinic days took place, serving some 200\npatients, including 129 comprehensive eye exams (92% with dilated fundus exams) and\n72 follow-ups. Patients were seen in seven different shelters catering to men, women\nand Indigenous patients. Nearly all (n = 125, 97%) patients required an intervention,\nincluding management of refractive conditions (n = 109, 85%) and/or management or\nreferrals for significant ocular or systemic disease (n = 17, 13%) such as diabetic\nretinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts and neuro-ophthalmic disorders. Over 140 direct teaching\nhours were provided to 31 optometry students. Qualitative feedback from the student\nexperience reported lessened prejudices and increased awareness of the importance\nto adapt their approach to suit the realities of marginalized patients.\nConclusion: The newly implemented RC clinic allows the first report of ophthalmic clinical data\non the Montreal homeless population. Optometry students exposed to RC in its first\nyear of operations seem to enhance their competencies to care for marginalized patients.\nFurther research is planned, regarding ophthalmic epidemiology in Montreal homeless\nand associated social determinants of health, barriers to accessing eye care and evolution\nof students' perceptions on homelessness.","title":"Eye Care for the Homeless First Year of Data from a Mobile Teaching Clinic","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185204\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The information to be uncovered will provide valuable\ndata about the frequency of the most common eye diseases in Puerto Rico.\nMethods:\nA retrospective cross-sectional study of subjects examined at the Inter American\nUniversity of Puerto Rico School of Optometry Eye Institute Clinics between 2010 and\n2017 was performed. Subjects considered had a complete eye evaluation. Demographic\ndata, medical and ocular history were reviewed for each subject. Diagnosis from anterior\nand posterior segment conditions were classified according to the most current eye\ndiseases protocols.\nResults:\nA total of 1,409 randomly selected health records of subjects older than 40 years\nof age were included. Of the eligible subjects 67.2% were females. The most prevalent\nsystemic conditions were hypertension (20.9%), diabetes mellitus (10.1%), hypercholesterolemia\n(7.5%), and rheumatoid arthritis for a (6.3%). The most common anterior segment ocular\ndiseases were dry eye disease (13.1%), pinguecula (10.4%), and blepharitis (9.3%).\nThe most frequent posterior segment diseases were cataracts (59.9%), diabetic retinopathy\n(22.5%), age related macular degeneration (13.1%), hypertensive retinopathy (11.5%),\nand glaucoma (7.1%).

However, a desktop literature review revealed\na dearth of scholarly publications from the African optometric sector, indicating\na lack of empirical data to inform eye health policy and planning to reverse this\ntrend. Research evidence is also a critical element in transformative education, and\nacademics should play a central role in producing research that informs locally relevant\ncurricula. A research-informed curriculum will produce graduates with knowledge, skills\nand attitudes relevant to the contexts within which they will work.\nPurpose\nTo\nidentify barriers to research engagement at optometry schools in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nMethods: A qualitative approach using a participatory action research design was employed.\nThrough a purposive sampling strategy academic leadership from 17 institutions, representing\n11 sub Saharan African countries, were invited to participate. An optometric research\nand transformative education workshop was held with representatives from the South,\nWest and East African regions. Barriers and enablers to research were identified and\nthrough a multi-staged iterative cycle of problem identification, active reflection\nand solution development, a strategy for research capacity development in sub Saharan\nAfrica evolved.\nResults: Key barriers to research production included inexperienced faculty, high academic\nworkloads and a lack of research skills, mentorship programmes and research funding.\nA core enabler was the strong desire to develop research-informed solutions to reverse\nthe scourge of blindness and vision impairment in Africa. The few experienced academics\nmay mentor young researchers using web-based platforms. The Optometric Research and\nEducation for Africa (OREA) initiative was launched, forming three regional research\ncohorts (Southern, West and East African) that identified research priorities for\ncollaborative studies.\nConclusion: Discussion\nThe strong impetus to enhance academic research capacity and\nscholarly publication output signals a turning point in optometric education in Africa.\nIdentification of barriers allowed for sharing of best practices and identification\nof opportunities. Regional cohorts will strengthen grant applications, foster skills\ntransfer and build a stronger research ethos in represented countries. The formation\nof OREA in sub Saharan Africa will ultimately inform policy around education that\nimproves the eye health care of patients that the profession is mandated to serve.\nConclusion\nOvercoming\nglobal eye health challenges is strengthened by collective strategy and regional collaboration.\nThis initiative serves as a potential model for other under-resourced contexts seeking\nto gather research evidence to inform eye health policy and transform curricula towards\nlocal relevance.","title":"Research Capacity Development A Key Strategy in the Fight Against Blindness and Vision  Impairment in Africa","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185206\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Kwa Zulu Natal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Diane van Staden, Khathutshelo Percy Mashige, Tate Madlala\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Kwa Zulu Natal, University of Kwa Zulu Natal, University of Kwa Zulu Natal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This live patient grand\nrounds format provided students with direct patient care experience in the assessment,\ndiagnosis, and treatment of select ocular conditions delivered in a short period of\ntime to 85 students.\nMethods: The third-year students were given a baseline survey prior to the program to evaluate\nself-reported exposure, comfort in examining, and comfort with treating/managing a\nlist of ocular conditions. Live patients with certain existing conditions (glaucoma,\nAMD, post-op LASIK/cataract surgery/retinal detachment/strabismus surgery) and patients\nwith standardized conditions (acute conjunctivitis, bacterial corneal ulcer) interacted\nwith students in a live grand rounds format to supplement their clinical experience.\nThe students were divided into different sessions, and assigned into small groups.\nEach session had four stations with a live patient who had either a real or standardized\ncondition(s) that the student team addressed. A faculty member guided the students\nduring their encounter at each station. A final debrief was held for a guided discussion\nemphasizing the clinical thought process and to provide additional clinical information.\nThe same survey was given after the pilot to assess their post-program self-reported\nexposure, comfort in examining, and in treating/managing the same list of ocular diseases.\nA separate survey assessed their opinions about the pilot program.\nResults: The students reported an increase in clinical exposure (mean 23.4%), improved comfort\nin performing related clinical skills (mean 19.9%), and an increase in comfort of\ntreating/managing (mean 25.0%) the seen live conditions assessed.

Brain Injury Vision Symptom Survey (BIVSS)\nhas been validated to assist health care providers document vision complaints secondary\nto brain injury in adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether individuals\nwith history of mild TBI (mTBI) had more visual symptoms compared to ones without\nmTBI. In addition, we also determined the possible associated factors with BIVSS scores.\nMethods: A total of 150 subjects aged from 19 to 81 years were enrolled from the annual meeting\nof American Academy of Optometry 2016. The following parameters were collected: ocular\nand systemic health histories, current medications, history of TBI, and modified BIVSS\n(18 questions). Analysis of covariance was used to compare the BIVSS scores among\nsubjects without mTBI, with one episode of mTBI and with two or more episodes of mTBI\nby controlling cofounders of age and gender. Multiple regressions were performed to\nidentify whether age, gender, history of mTBI, and number of mTBIs predicted BIVSS\nscores.\nResults: There were 45 subjects with previous history of mTBI and 105 subjects without history\nof mTBI. Among the subjects with positive mTBI history, 18 of them had more than one\nepisode of mTBI. BIVSS scores were statistically significantly higher in subjects\nwith two or more episodes of mTBI than subjects with no history of mTBI or with one\nepisode of mTBI (P= 0.001). Both number of mTBIs (P= 0.002) and gender (P= 0.003)\nstatistically significantly predicted BIVSS scores.\nConclusion: We found that individuals with more episodes of mTBI had more visual symptoms than\nones without mTBI or with one episode of mTBI.

Though optic nerve regeneration research\nhas advanced in small mammals, there is not currently a larger, more clinically-relevant\nanimal model of TON. The ocular-neural anatomy of a mini-pig is more similar to a\nhuman than that of a rodent. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to optimize\na surgical approach to the optic nerve in the mini-pig.\nMethods: Under anesthesia, the lateral aspect of the upper and lower eyelid was dissected by\nmeans of a lateral canthotomy. The lateral conjunctival fornix and periorbita was\nincised and the optic nerve was approached by detaching the lateral rectus and dissecting\nthrough the intraconal orbital fat, the circular muscle, and the peripapillary intraconal\nfat. Comparatively, a lateral orbital approach was employed in order to limit potential\nlateral canthal irritation. Here, the intraconal space was approached through a skin\nincision posterior to the lateral canthus which was followed by dissection through\nsuperficial temporal fascia and the pretemporal fat pad to the temporalis fossa. Incision\nof the temporalis muscle exposed the fibrous lateral orbital wall which was incised\nwith the underlying periorbita. Access to the extraconal space allowed the lateral\nrectus muscle to be retracted inferiorly, facilitating the dissection of the underlying\nintraconal fat and circular muscle. Generous exposure of the optic nerve was accomplished\nand layers were closed in reverse order.\nResults: Trans-conjuctival and lateral orbital approaches enabled sufficient access to the\nmini-pig optic nerve. Observational results showed the lateral orbital approach was\npreferred for its simplicity, larger exposure, and preservation of sensory nerves.\nConclusion: We characterized a surgical approach to be used for scaling successful rodent treatment\nstrategies following TON.","title":"Optimization of a Surgical Approach to the Porcine Optic Nerve","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185192\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        United States Army Institute of Surgical Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Gregory Bramblett\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        United States Army Institute of Surgical Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Considering that most entering optometry\nstudents have a biological sciences background, it is not unusual to find some students\nexperiencing difficulty in optics courses. The primary purpose of this study is to\ndetermine if a mathematics assessment test (MAT) can predict the performance of first-year\noptometry students in the portions of an optics course that rely on mathematical problem\nsolving.\nMethods: Students in the 2021 MCPHS School of Optometry OPT 630 Geometric and Physical Optics\ncourse participated in the study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nDuring the first week of classes, students took a 10-question survey about their mathematics\nbackground, undergraduate GPA and Optometry Admissions Test (OAT) score, along with\na 30-question Mathematics Assessment Test (MAT). Data from the survey and the MAT\nwere compared by linear regression to performance on the first two exams of the Optics\ncourse.\nResults: Fifty-four (83%) of the enrolled students participated in the study. Students who\nscored highly on the MAT had high reported OAT scores (p<0.0001) but MAT score\nwas not correlated with reported undergraduate GPA (p=0.74). Students with high MAT\nscores tended to have better grades on the first two exams of the Optics course (p=0.075)\nwhereas performance on these exams was not as well correlated with the reported OAT\nscore (p=0.30) nor with the reported undergraduate GPA (p=0.28).\nConclusion: The MAT may be a better predictor of performance in the first two exams of the Optics\ncourse than the OAT score or undergraduate GPA. Limitations of the study include a\nrelatively small sample size and reliance on reported OAT and GPA. Nonetheless, the\nresults imply that students who have difficulty on the MAT may benefit from mathematics\ntutoring early in the Optics course.","title":"Can a Mathematics Assessment Test Predict Performance of Optometry Students in Optics","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185193\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry, MCPHS University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nancy Coletta\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry, MCPHS University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the ISE scores of NBEO between\nstudents with MIP and students without MIP.\nResults: A total of 70 students participated MIP and the rest 65 students did not. The average\n(SD; median) ISE for students without MIP was 62.89 (SD= 25.63; median=63.00) versus\n74.44 (SD= 21.81: median=81.50) for students with MIP with statistically significant\ndifference, P= 0.01.\nThe average (SD; median) grade point average for the students\nwithout MIP was 3.26 (SD= .42; median = 3.29) versus 3.30 (SD= .44; median = 3.38)\nwithout statistical significance ( P=0.55).\nConclusion: Partaking in the mock practical significantly improved students' performance on the\nISE portion of the Part III NBEO, and therefore may lead to a better overall score.\nThis data suggests that individualized instruction in a mock practical format is an\neffective way to boost skill performance of optometry students.","title":"Mock Injection Practicals Improve Student Performance on the Injections Skills Exam","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185194\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        John Baker, Yi Pang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study used much more rigorous methodology as well as a blur condition\nto evaluate whether the findings of the pilot study were repeatable. Four criteria\nof VA scoring were examined: letter-by-letter, 3 or more, 4 or more, and all 5 optotypes\ncorrect on a line.\nMethods: One eye each of 32 subjects (22 females, mean/SD age = 25.6/2.2 yrs.) were tested\nmonocularly with 6 high-contrast ETDRS visual acuity charts at a distance of 16 feet.\nSubjects were best-corrected (NoBlur) for one condition (Range of EDS: +0.88 to -7.50)\nand were blurred (Blur) +1.50 using a trial lens for another condition. The average\nof two visual acuities for each condition were used as the outcome measure (i.e. 16\ntotal VAs: 4 criteria, 2 viewing conditions). The subjects and the examiner were masked\nto the criteria. The chart order, viewing condition order, and criterion used were\nall randomized a priori. A termination rule of missing 4 letters on a line was used.\nAll VAs were recorded using the logMAR specification and were checked for normality.\nMean visual acuity differences from the 4 criteria were analyzed using repeated measures\nANOVA with post-hoc Tukey testing.\nResults: The NoBlur mean/SD VAs were -0.10/0.07;, -0.09/0.08, -0.08/0.08, and -0.02/0.10 for\nletter-by-letter acuity, 3 or more correct line acuity, 4 or more correct line acuity,\nand 5 correct on a line acuity, respectively. The corresponding Blur VAs were: 0.42/0.18,\n0.41/0.18, 0.46/0.17, 0.53/0.16. The different acuity criteria produced statistically\nsignificant differences for both conditions [F(3,31) > 17.1, p < 0.001]. For\nthe NoBlur condition, all criteria resulted in similar VA, except for the whole line\ncriteria (p < 0.001). For the Blur condition, the letter-by-letter and 3 or more\non a line criteria were not different (p = 0.98), whereas all other criterion differed\nsignificantly from each other (p < 0.04).\nConclusion: For varying levels of visual acuity, the typically utilized practice of using a criterion\nof 3 or more letters correct on a line to measure visual acuity is appropriate and\nresults in an acuity estimate very close to research standard criteria of letter-by-letter\nacuity. The use of a 4 or 5 correct on a line criteria will underestimate the visual\nacuity.","title":"DoubleMasked Visual Acuity Testing to Examine the Accuracy of Line Acuity Criteria","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185187\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        So.

One eye was\ntested per person under varying ambient illumination in the mesopic conditions. Each\nparticipant was subjected to a simulation of myopic error by wearing, on a trial frame,\na 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, and 2.00 D lens, which effectively induced an equivalent myopic\nerror. The test was repeated under different pupil size (measured by pupil gauge).\nResults: The recorded distance visual acuity is dependent on both the degree of myopia (the\nlarger the myopia, the lower the recorded VA. For the 3 mm pupil diameter, the average\ndrop of VA per degree of myopia was 0.24 logMAR; for the 7 mm pupil diameter, the\naverage drop of VA per degree of myopia was 0.30 logMAR. It is interesting that for\nthe same degree of myopia (example, -2.0 D), there would be a more than 0.30 logMAR\ndifference between a large pupil of 7 mm (with worse VA) compared to a small pupil\nof 3 mm (with better VA).\nThe pupil size is an important factor affecting visual\nacuity: The effects associated with pupil size and visual acuity include diffraction,\naberrations, depth of field, and Gaussian beam profile. A small pupil reduces the\npresence of high order aberrations, and thereby, benefits visual acuity. Also, a small\npupil results in an increase of the perceptual depth of focus and, thus, to an increased\nperceptual tolerance of a possible refractive error, such as myopia, hyperopia, or\nastigmatism. A large pupil leads to a larger geometrical blur circle projected on\nthe retina. Despite the fact that at the image-forming plane (focus) a larger pupil\nforms a more constrained PSF, and, thus, the real image formed is of finer detail,\nthis configuration results in a larger geometrical blur.\nConclusion: For the same degree of myopia, the loss of visual acuity is strongly dependent on\npupil size. The larger the pupil, the more rapid the loss of visual acuity per degree\nof spherical error (defocus). Conversely, for a small pupil, the loss of visual acuity\nper degree of defocus is less. During an eye exam, it is important to understand that\nany examinee will naturally tend to decrease his / her pupil, in order to improve\nvisual acuity.","title":"The Effect of Pupil Size on Visual Acuity in Simulated Myopic Patients","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185189\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Pikeville\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ishani Patel, George Asimellis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Pikeville, University of Pikeville\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study compared acuity change from a 4 to 6mm pupil\nsize for 2 refractive corrections for eyes of individuals with and without DS by way\nof typical adults reading simulated acuity charts.\nMethods: Five observers read acuity charts simulating the retinal image resulting from both\na 4 and 6mm pupil diameter of corrected eyes of individuals with and without DS. Dilated\nwavefront error (WFE) was obtained from the right eye of 27 adults with DS and 24\ncontrols. For each eye, >12000 sphero-cylindrical combinations of refraction were\nadded to the measured WFE to generate residual WFE in the presence of each refraction.\nAcuity charts were then created for the single refraction corresponding with the best\nvalue of two metrics: the visual Strehl ratio (VSX) and pupil fraction (PFSt), for\nboth 4mm and 6mm pupils. The resultant 228 charts were grouped into 4 sets with a\nclear chart randomly inserted in each set to determine each observer's baseline acuity.\nDilated observers viewed the simulated charts on a monitor through a unit magnification\ntelescope with a 3mm pupil aperture to minimize the contribution of their own aberration,\nreading each chart until 5 letters were missed. Letters lost was calculated as the\ndifference in acuity from the clear chart. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to test\nfor differences in letters lost between groups and within-subject factors (pupil size\nand metric) as well as two-way interactions involving pupil size and metric.\nResults: The acuity for charts representing eyes with DS had a significantly greater loss of\nletters (2.5 letters lost) than charts for control eyes (p=0.0002). Overall, there\nwas a significant interaction between group (DS vs control) and pupil size (p=.03).\nThe acuity drop from baseline was less for the 4mm pupil than for the 6mm pupil for\ncharts representing DS eyes (6.5 letters vs 11 letters, p<0.0001), as well as for\ntypical eyes (4.5 letters vs. 8 letters, p< 0.0001). There was no statistically\nsignificant interaction between pupil size and metric (p=0.66).\nConclusion: Although acuity dropped more with increasing pupil size for charts representing DS\neyes, the decrease in acuity was 4.5 letters compared to the decrease of 3.5 letters\nobserved for control eye charts, and thus the difference is not likely clinically\nmeaningful. These findings suggest that corrections determined by optimization of\nmetrics VSX and PFST for a 4mm pupil size will perform well if the pupil increases\nunder dim illumination and this performance will likely not differ between DS and\ncontrol eyes.","title":"Simulating the Impact of a Dynamic Pupil on Visual Acuity for Corrected Eyes of Adults  with and Without Down Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185190\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Julia Benoit, Jason Marsack, Heather Anderson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, University of Houston, University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study investigates the difference between eye-hand reaction\ntime with the dominant versus non-dominant hand, with consideration of the athletes'\nsports participation history. The hypothesis was that softball athletes would have\nfaster nondominant hand reaction times due to the fielding demands of the sport.\nMethods: Retrospective data from 56 female athletes from Pacific University's women's basketball\nand softball teams was evaluated for this study. As part of pre-season testing, all\nparticipants completed a history form to determine their previous and current sports\ninvolvement, and each athlete answered questions regarding their dominant hand (defined\nas the shooting hand for the basketball players and throwing hand for the softball\nathletes). Reaction Time for each hand was measured with the Senaptec Sensory Station,\nadhering to a standardized protocol.\nResults: No significant differences were found between dominant and non-dominant hand reaction\ntimes in athletes from the two sports using paired sample T-test for each sport and\none-way ANOVA to test the main effect of sport and interaction between sport and handedness.\nAll of the softball players were right-handed, and 96.4% of the basketball players\nwere left-handed. The average non-dominant hand reaction time for both softball and\nbasketball athletes was 0.005 seconds faster than the dominant hand, and the average\ndifference between softball and basketball reaction times for either hand was 0.012\nseconds. Many of the athletes completing the study had participated in multiple sports.\nConclusion: No significant differences were found between dominant and non-dominant hand reaction\ntimes in women's basketball and softball athletes.

The aim of this study was to provide normative data, in terms\nof visual function under monocular versus binocular conditions, for subtests A and\nB of the L-R EHC Test.\nMethods: Thirty adults (mean age 57.5±12.3, range 20-85 years) and twenty five children (mean\nage 7.8±1.9, range 5-11 years) with good visual acuity but without psychological/cognitive\nimpairment or binocular anomalies used a rubber-tipped stylus to trace the six shapes\nin Test A or Test B, with right eye, left eye and binocular viewing conditions, according\nto a randomised design. Non-parametric analyses were performed to establish whether\nTests A and B were comparable, and whether errors made or time taken differed according\nto viewing condition.\nResults: Binocularly, on average, the time taken and errors made by adults on Test A was 225.9±96.4\nseconds/52.0±26.0 errors which did not significantly differ from results on Test B\n(217.5±124.3 seconds/36.3±20.9 errors). Similarly, under binocular conditions children\ntook 206.5±74.8 seconds making 58.3±24.7 errors on average on Test A, and 209.0±62.1\nseconds with 74.2±36.4 errors on Test B. Regardless whether the right or left eye\nwas used, average monocular performance (time/errors) was consistent for both adults\nand children. However, when viewing monocularly, children were slower (p<0.05)\nand made more errors (p<0.05) than when binocular, whereas adults performed similarly\nunder both viewing conditions. In general, taking longer to do the test was associated\nwith increased errors (p<0.001) for both adults and children. For those assigned\nmonocular conditions for the first and third rounds of testing, there was no significant\ndifference in the time taken or the number of errors made. Ninety-three percent were\nright handed.\nConclusion: Due to the absence of any significant learning effect and the equivalence in time\nand error performance found for the two abbreviated versions of the L-R EHC test,\nthis test presents capabilities as a useful clinical tool for pre-/post intervention\nmeasurement of graphomotor ability. The differing monocular normative data presented\nfor children on the L-R EHC test compared to that of adults may be useful to understand\nvisual function in unilateral vision loss, such as in amblyopia, and in developmental\ndelay.","title":"Monocular and Binocular Norms Using the LeeRyan EyeHand Coordination App for Adults  and Children","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185184\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry and Vision Science UNSW\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Barbara Junghans, Sieu Khuu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry and Vision Science UNSW, School of Optometry and Vision Science UNSW\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The participants read\nall of the reading charts in a randomised order under the same clinical conditions\nusing one eye only. The Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman agreement were calculated\nbetween the two testing sessions and the inter-chart reliability analysis was yielded\nby an overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient.\nResults: The test-rest and inter-chart reliability were high for the MNread. A Bland-Altman\nplot showed that the agreement was low in Colenbrander and Radner for measuring the\nreading acuity. Moderately weak correlations for measuring maximum reading speed were\nfound in Colenbrander (r = 0.550) and Bailey-Lovie (r = 0.570).

Evidence for whether the lenses make any\ndifference in color perception is limited. In this study we evaluated changes in performance\non 4 standard color vision tests after subjects wore the lenses for an adaptation\nperiod.\nMethods: Ten subjects with congenital CVD (diagnosed by anomaloscopy) were tested with and\nwithout the EnChroma lens on the Ishihara, HRR, Farnsworth D15 and Lanthony Desaturated\nD15 tests. The order of the tests was randomized. Color deficiencies ranged from mild\nto severe protan and deutan defects. Testing at the first visit established the overall\npass and fail rates. All subjects completed a minimum of 10 hours of lens wear (per\nmanufacturer recommendations) before returning for a follow-up visit on a separate\nday where all of the tests were repeated. All tests were performed using a standard\nilluminant C source. The illuminance used at the first visit was 500 lux and at the\nsecond visits this was increased by a factor of 7 to compensate for the optical density\nof the lens. Standard clinical pass/fail criteria were used for each test. Where applicable,\nthe number plates or number of major crossovers were analyzed for the tests. Proportions\nof subjects failing each test were analyzed and two-way paired t-tests were used to\nanalyze the continuous data.\nResults: Improvement was found in all color vision tests with use of the Enchroma lens. For\nthe HRR: 20% fewer subjects failed the test and 50% had a less severe defect. For\nthe Ishihara test: 30% fewer subjects failed the test and on average significantly\nfewer plates were missed (P = 0.004).

In VMSS, the individual's perceived midline may be shifted laterally or\nvertically potentially creating a postural imbalance. Little is understood of the\nepidemiology or prognosis of VMSS.\nPURPOSE  VMSS is currently assessed\nmanually with a hand-held \"˜wand to determine the individual's subjective response\nto their midline position. The goal in this study is to test a device that would standardize\nthe assessment of the perceived midline, mechanically controlling the speed, target\nsize and test distance. This will assist with development of an accurate assessment\ntool with specific necessary parameters.\nMethods: METHODS Twenty-four control participants from two age groups (18-40 and >65\nyears) without stroke were recruited. In experiment 1, the perceived midline was measured\nfor 3 target sizes, 2 speeds and 3 distances with the device and based on the data\na speed and size was selected. In experiment 2, the vertical and horizontal perceived\nmidline was measured for three different distances (25, 50 and 100 cms).\nResults: RESULTS For experiment 1, repeated measures ANOVA for the means and\nstandard deviations showed no main effect of speed, target size or target direction\nand no interaction (p > 0.05) for the perceived midline position or the variability\n(p > 0.05), One speed (2.3 degrees per second) and target size (1.3 cms diameter\nwhite sphere) was chosen. In experiment 2, repeated measures ANOVA for the horizontal\nmidline position for age and distance (2x age, 3x distance) showed no significant\neffect of age and no interaction (p > 0.05), but there was an effect of distance\nfor the standard deviations. For the vertical midline, there was an effect of both\nage and distance. Handedness had no significant impact on the midline position (2\nsample t-test, p > 0.05) for the older age group (all younger particiapnts were right\nhanded). The mean and 95% ranges of the perceived midline for control participants\nis shown in Table 1.\nConclusion: CONCLUSIONS This study shows that the measurement of midline is tolerant of\ndifferences of target size, speed and direction, but differences of age and distance\nwere found.

Visual\nrehabilitation has been well documented to ameliorate many oculomotor problems such\nas such as accommodation, vergence, and eye movement deficits. Although effective,\nconventional vision therapy intervention requires considerable effort and time. Amplification\nof traditional VT to boost efficiency and efficacy would be advantageous and likely\npotentiate the visual rehabilitation journey.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate\nwhether addition of daily feedback for monocular fixational accuracy and stability\nwith the Macular Integrity Tester (MIT) would yield better short-term outcomes.\nMethods: Patients who sought treatment for vision problems secondary to mild brain injury were\nrecruited from a university vision therapy service. Those patients who consented to\nbe included in this study were divided in two groups: 1) conventional VT, 2) conventional\nVT supplemented with additional daily home MIT training. Fixation accuracy and stability\nwas assessed using the EyeLink II eye tracker using a custom designed fixation pattern\nprogram. Findings were compared before and after VT for both groups in order to analyze\nfixational behavior before and after therapy within groups and between groups.\nResults: The analysis of EyeLink II measurement was done with a linear mixed model analysis\nusing IBM SPSS. Comparison of the fixation stability and accuracy before and after\nVT with MIT training revealed improvement in fixational behavior after the training\nfor both the left and the right eye, but significantly more for the left eye for the\n8-week trial period. Conventional VT without MIT training did not produce significant\noverall improvement in fixation ability during this same length trial period. Based\nonly on this pilot study, it is not known whether a longer intervention trial of conventional\nVT or equalized total home training time between groups would have resulted in a similar\ndegree of fixational improvement as those who received both the MIT intervention plus\ntraditional VT.\nConclusion: Based on this pilot study, the addition of the Haidinger's brush feedback to enhance\nfixation improved fixation accuracy and stability outcomes over the 8-week study period\nand proved to be a beneficial supplement to the traditional VT regimen for mTBI patients.","title":"Comparison of Vision Therapy Rehabilitation Outcomes with the Addition of the Macular  Integrity Tester MIT to Traditional VT in Patients with Mild Traumatic Injury A  Pilot Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185180\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Aalen University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Hannu Laukkanen\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

In this study, we looked at whether\nthe reverse phi motion was seen when the stimulus was presented dichoptically. This\nwill allow us to deduce the level of motion processing in the visual pathway.\nMethods: Clinically normal subjects in age group 18-35 years were included. We used random\ndot kinematogram (RDK) with 500 dots in a 10x10deg aperture. Temporal interval was\nvaried from 0 to 33.3ms in multiples of 16.7ms and the spatial offset was varied from\n0.1 to 0.5 deg in steps of 0.1 achieved by varying the dot speed from 6 to 30 deg/sec\nrespectively. In reverse phi motion condition, the dots changed contrast polarity\nat every displacement. 100% coherent dots were presented on a gray background in either\nupward or downward direction (50% guess rate) and the subjects responded to the direction\nof motion. Each spatial and temporal offset was repeated randomly and hit rates were\ncalculated. Three conditions namely monocular, binocular and dichoptic presentations\nwere tested and hit rates were compared. For dichoptic presentation, a haploscope\nset up was used with two 7 inch monitors on either side of the subject reflected onto\n45 deg angled mirrors so that right eye received white dots and left eye received\nblack dots. In order to perceive reversed direction in dichoptic presentation, the\ninputs from right eye and left eye have to be integrated. We also tested these conditions\nin regular phi motion in which there was no contrast reversals of the dots. Correct\nresponse for regular phi is the direction of physical displacement of the dots whereas\nfor reverse phi, it is the opposite direction. No error feedback was provided.\nResults: Ten subjects participated. Mean age was 29.7 ± 3.6 years. All participants had normal\nvisual acuity and contrast sensitivity. In monocular and binocular presentations,\nreverse phi motion was perceived at temporal intervals 0ms and 16.6ms at all spatial\noffsets except 0.5 deg spatial offset at 16.6ms temporal interval. In dichoptic presentation,\nhit rate for reversed motion was below chance level at all temporal interval and spatial\noffset levels. At 33.3 ms temporal interval, reversed motion was not perceived even\nin monocular and binocular conditions. In regular phi motion, forward motion was perceived\nin all presentation conditions.\nConclusion: The perception of forward motion of reverse phi motion in dichoptic presentation may\nsuggest that the reverse phi motion involves low level processing in the hierarchy\nof motion perception.","title":"Interocular Presentation of Reverse Phi Motion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185181\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The purpose of this study was to compare contact lens and spectacle performance\non a rapid pointing task.\nMethods: Subjects were tested using a wall-mounted AcuVision 1000, which required them to rapidly\ntouch lighted targets. Subjects performed this task (randomly) while wearing contact\nlenses and again while wearing spectacles. The targets were presented for a maximum\nduration of 0.80s, with the next target appearing either when time had expired or\nwhen the current target was hit. The number and location of correct (first 0.56s of\ntarget presentation), late (last 0.24s of target presentation), and missed targets\nwas recorded.\nResults: The number of correct, late, and missed targets and the time to complete the task\nwere compared for contact lenses and spectacles. The mean time to completion was faster\nwith contact lenses (mean difference 1.50 ± 1.87s, p<0.001). Mean differences between\ncontact lenses and spectacles were determined. The total number of correct responses\noverall was significantly higher in contact lenses (5.32 ± 7.60, p =0.001), the total\nnumber of missed responses was significantly lower in contact lenses (5.16 ± 7.46,\np=0.001), and the number of late responses was not significantly different (0.16 ±\n8.08, p > 0.05).

Performance was significantly better\nin the periphery for contact lenses, but performance was equal centrally between the\ntwo refractive modalities. While peripheral accuracy was better in contact lenses,\nthere was no relationship between the decrease in peripheral accuracy with spectacles\nand refractive error. This suggests that the difference in performance between contact\nlenses and spectacles is due to field of view constraints resulting from the spectacle\nframe.","title":"Comparison of EyeHand Coordination with Spectacles and Contact Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185182\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nicklaus Fogt\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Diopsys®\nshort-duration transient pattern reversal VEPs were recorded 1.1 hours after DC or\nMC consumption.

Stimuli were high (85%) and low contrast (15%) checkerboards\n(30 min. check size) pattern-reversed 2X/sec. Subjects were tested binocularly twice\nwith habitual correction. The average N75 to P100 amplitude and P100 latency were\ncomputed for each subject for high and low contrast VEPs provided that P100 reliability\nindices were ?80%.\nResults: Two-way repeated measures ANOVA of VEP latency across chocolate (MC vs. DC) and contrast\n(high vs. low) did not show an overall effect of chocolate but post-hoc paired t-testing\nshowed that low contrast latency was increased for MC (mean latency 106 msec.) vs\ndark chocolate (mean latency 103 msec., p = 0.04). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA\nof VEP amplitude across chocolate and contrast did not show an overall effect of chocolate\nbut high contrast amplitude was greater for DC (19 µV) vs. MC (17 µV, p = 0.03). Moreover,\n19/29 subjects (70%) showed an amplitude increase following dark vs. chocolate (Wilcoxon\ntest, p = 0.04). Eight subjects showed ?3 µV increase after DC vs. MC (range: 0 -\n9 µV) while four showed an increase ?3 µV after MC (range: 0 - 4 µV).\nConclusion: These findings indicate that acute consumption of a commercially available, palatable\nDC bar can increase VEP amplitude and decrease VEP latency, both indicative of improved\nvisual performance. It is conceivable that these effects reflect increased blood flow\nand nutrient supply from flavanol rich dark chocolate. However, effects were small\nand the impact on real-world performance requires additional testing. Since subjects\nwere healthy young adults with normal vision, acute effects of DC consumption may\nbe greater in at-risk patients including elderly, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and\nAMD patients who may benefit from increased blood flow.","title":"Dark Chocolate Enhancement of Visual Evoked Potentials","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185168\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nirmani Karunathilake, Jeff Rabin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry, UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The primary outcome was throughput: the ratio\nof CS and VA (normalized to a 100-point scale) to response time; the higher the throughput\nthe greater the performance. For black/white CS and VA, both overall and threshold\nresponse times (last 4 trials) were computed. Parametric repeated-measures ANOVA and\npaired t-tests were used to analyze data.\nResults: Two-way repeated measures ANOVA of throughput (performance/time) across verbal distraction\nand chocolate type showed significant effects of distraction and chocolate type (F=13.6,\np<0.001) with a significant interaction (F=10.9, p<0.01). Post hoc t-tests showed\nthat the significant difference between chocolate types occurred with verbal distraction\n(t=9.0, p<0.0001; mean DC: 57.1, mean MC 50.0, p<0.0001) consistent with our\nprior research on hands-free verbal distraction (Am J Prev Med. doi: 10.1016/j.amepre.2016.05.006).\nConclusion: These findings indicate that acute consumption of a commercially available, highly\npalatable DC bar can improve visual performance in the presence of verbal distraction\nwith hands-free cell phone communication. These small yet significant effects suggest\nthat DC flavanols can improve visual performance in real world settings which impact\nsafety. It is possible that increased blood flow to retina, visual pathway or cortex\nmay underlie these beneficial effects. Further research is needed to determine clinical\nsignificance and duration of these effects. Elderly patients and those with ocular\ndisease may benefit more from increased blood flow from DC.","title":"Dark Chocolate Improves Visual Performance During HandsFree Cell Phone Communication","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185169\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Korey Patrizi, Jeff Rabin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry, UIW Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Blumenthal, et al (2003) identified 11\nsources of variability in test-retest thresholds in SWAP, which together only explained\nabout one third of the variability in their data. No published data report on potential\nsources of intersubject variability for SWAP in normal subjects. Since the yellow\nmacular pigment selectively absorbs blue light, its density could affect detection\nof blue stimuli on a yellow background, as tested in SWAP. This study explored the\nrelationship between MPOD and SWAP global indices in young, healthy adults.\nMethods: MPOD scores (heterochromic flicker photometry, QuantifEye, Zeavision) and SWAP (Goldmann\nV, FASTPAC 24-2 on HFA-II, Zeiss) global indices (mean deviation-MD and pattern standard\ndeviation-PSD) from both eyes of 119 young, healthy, non-smoker adults between the\nages of 22 and 35 years with normal vision that were collected during optometric laboratory\nexercises were retrospectively reviewed. Data for right and left eyes were separately\ncompared using simple linear regression (R version 3.3.3) to predict SWAP MD and PSD\nbased on MPOD.\nResults: MPOD was found to be a small, but significant predictor of SWAP MD for both the right\nand left eyes. Right eye: MD = -0.18 - 2.88(MPOD), p = 0.033, R-squared = 0.038. Left\neye: MD = -0.73 - 2.73(MPOD), p = 0.039, R-squared = 0.036. MPOD was found not to\nbe a significant predictor of PSD for either eye (p = 0.11 RE, p = 0.66 LE).\nConclusion: These data suggest that a small, but significant source of intersubject variability\nin SWAP MD in young healthy adults with normal vision may be due to intersubject differences\nin MPOD. Whether MPOD at least partially accounts for SWAP variability in older adults\nwith normal vision and for variability differences between SWAP and white-on-white\nperimetry remain to be explored.","title":"Comparison of MPOD by Heterochromic Flicker Photometry and SWAP Global Indices in  Young Healthy Adults","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185170\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The Vistech Contrast Sensitivity\nChart and Hardy Rand Rittler (HRR) Color Vision tests were used to measure the Contrast\nSensitivity Functions (CSF) and Color Vision, respectively. Measurements were made\nthrough filters (50%, 35% and 15% transmittance) that approximated the percent transmittance\nof light, medium and dark automobile window tints, respectively. Measurements were\nrepeated under a Mesopic condition, simulated by using Neutral Density filters of\na 1.0 log unit density strength.\nResults: Contrast sensitivity data were plotted as a function of the following spatial frequencies\n1.5, 3.0, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree for three filters and a \"˜no-filter' baseline\ncondition under Photopic and Mesopic luminance levels. For each condition, mean threshold\ncontrast was analyzed using a Two-Factor Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).\nThe two factors were spatial frequency and percent transmittance. Under Mesopic conditions,\nthe main effect of percent transmittance was significant (F (3,419) = 75.53, p <\n0.001). Under Photopic conditions the main effect of percent transmittance was non-significant\n(F (3,419) = 0.89, p < 0.44). The results imply that under simulated Mesopic conditions\nthere was a significant drop in contrast sensitivity across all spatial frequencies,\nwith decreasing transmittance. Under photopic conditions, there was no significant\ndifference in contrast sensitivity across spatial frequencies with decreasing transmittance.\nThere was no significant change in chromatic discrimination with the tinted filters\nunder photopic or Mesopic conditions.\nConclusion: Our findings indicate that contrast sensitivity is significantly compromised with\nwindow tints, specifically under mesopic or lower luminance conditions.

Standard clinical tests (anomaloscope, Ishihara,\nHRR 4\nth\nEdition) were administered in addition to the Color Check test\nby Good-lite using a Richmond Illuminator (standard illuminant C equivalent) at 500\nlux of illuminance. The Color Check is similar to the 24-plate Ishihara test in appearance.\nThe screening portion is graded either out of the first 8 plates or all 15 red-green\nscreening plates.

One subject with a mild deutan\ndefect passed both the HRR test and the Color Check tests, while all other color defective\nsubjects failed both of the tests. Therefore, the screening component of the Color\nCheck test had a sensitivity of 86% [95% CI: 49-99%] and a specificity of 96% [95%\nCI: 85-99%], respectively.\nConclusion: Based on this small sample, the Color Check test appears to have reasonably good specificity\nand testability as a color vision screening test.

The Lanthony D15 is a much harder color\narrangement test that even color normal patients often cannot perform perfectly. In\nlight of the possibility to cheat on the Farnsworth D15 test through practice, occupations\nthat have very strict color vision requirements could choose to use the Lanthony D15\ntest for occupation entry. It is unexpected, and unknown, whether the Lanthony D15\ntest could be subverted through practice like the Farnsworth D15.\n\nCase Report: A 25-year old Caucasian male presented for follow-up color vision counseling. He had\na comprehensive color vision evaluation previously and was diagnosed with protanopia.\nHe reported consciously practicing to be more aware of colors and color names and\nwanted to see if his color vision had improved on testing. Standard book testing (Ishihara\nand HRR) revealed strong protanopia. Anomaloscope (Oculus HMC) testing also showed\nthat the patient accepted the full matching range (73 units) with decreasing luminance,\nindicating protanopia. He had 8 and 10 major crossovers on single trials of the Farnsworth\nand Lanthony D15 testing, respectively. The patient was offered time to practice the\nLanthony D15 test with the aim of seeing whether he could improve his performance.\nThe patient borrowed a Lanthony D15 test and color testing light. Over seven, non-consecutive\ndays, he reported practicing the Lanthony D15 for a total of about 2 hours. The patient\nreturned to clinic and was tested on another Lanthony D15 test for 3 trials using\na Richmond Illuminator (illuminant C equivalent) which gave 480 lux at the testing\nsurface. On the first two trials, the patient performed the Lanthony D15 perfectly.\nOn the 3\nrd\ntrial, a single transposition error occurred. Each trial averaged\n12 minutes. The patient was asked to perform a 4\nth\ntrial with a 2.5 minute\ntime limit and that trial resulted in 4 major crossovers.\nConclusion: The Lanthony D15 test maybe subverted by patients with protanopia. Enforcing a time\nlimit of 2-3 minutes, may be one way to counter patients that attempt to cheat on\nthe Lanthony D15 by practicing the test. Further studies of cases of deuteranopia\nand anomalous trichromacy are needed to determine whether the subversion found in\nthis case is applicable to other patients with congenital red-green color vision deficiency.","title":"Subversion of the Lanthony D15 Color Vision Test in a Case of Protanopia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185173\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        So.

Unknown is the effect of a notch filter on color contrast\nsensitivity (CCS) in CD.\nOur purpose was to explore the effects of a notch\nfilter on CCS in CD and color normal (CN) subjects.\nMethods: Subjects were 9 CD and 4 CN young healthy adults with normal vision OU. CCS for red\n(R), green (G), and blue (B) targets were measured for each eye (ColorDx, Konan Medical)\nwith (NF) and without (N) a notch filter (Enchroma, total transmission 28%) at 50\ncm with low overhead illumination and a 4-alternative forced choice staircase procedure.\nDifference in log CCS for R and G targets (R-G dif) was compared for N and NF conditions\nbetween CN and CD; between CN, Blue-Normal CDs (CD-BN: log CCS blue > 0.65), and\nBlue-Deficient CDs (CD-BD: log CCS blue <= 0.65); and between CN, G-deficient CDs\n(CD-G), and R-G-deficient CDs (CD-RG).\nResults: Between the N and NF conditions, two-tailed test for independent samples shows the\nmean change in R-G dif was significantly larger CD vs CN for both RE (0.136 ± 0.13\nvs 0.035 ± 0.01, p = 0.049) and LE (0.234 ± 0.12 vs 0.023 ± 0.03, p = 0.002); the\nmean change in R-G dif was significantly larger CD-BD vs CN for LE only (p = 0.0006);\nthe mean change in R-G dif was significantly larger CD-RG vs CN for LE only (p <\n0.0001); and the mean change in R-G dif was significantly larger CD-RG vs CD-G for\nLE only (p = 0.015).\nConclusion: NF creates greater mean R-G dif for CD than for CN. Subgroup analysis failed to identify\na specific parameter that may indicate a positive response to the notch filter. Additional\ndata are needed.","title":"Exploring the Effect of a Notch Filter on Color Contrast Sensitivity in Color Normal  and Color Deficient Young Healthy Adults  A Pilot Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185175\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Patricia Cisarik, Paul Harris\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern College of Optometry, Southern College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Some studies have\nalready reported thatthe EnChroma glasses help peoples with CVD to improve performances\non the pseudo isochromatiques tests. However, there is no study reporting that the\nEnChroma filters can restore the color vision perception for people with CVD. The\npresent study proposes to introduce a method to characterize the color vison performances\nthrough the selective chromatic filters.\nMethods: The selection of the participants in our study has ben achieved with the Nagel anomaloscope.\nThe participants in this study were: five control subjects in the normal trichromatic\ncategory, six dichromatic subjects - three of protanopic and three of deuteranopic\ntype, and four anomalous trichromatic subjects.\nThe color vision perceptual effects\ninduced by EnChroma filters have been evaluated by means of the color match method\non the Nagel anomaloscope, with a color-naming procedure, and using 14 monochromatic\nstimuli in the blue-green and green-red of the spectral zone.\nResults: The EnChroma glasses induce change in typical color match of the normal trichromatic\nsubjects, so that with the EnChroma glasses the normal trichromat becomes an abnormal\ntrichromat. The EnChroma glasses bring changes in the individual color match of the\nabnormal trichromatic subjects, but no improvement can be noted. Thus, regarding on\nthe color-naming results, we note that the EnChroma glasses have affected drastically\nthe cyan and yellow perception between the monochromatic stimuli in the blue-green\nand respectively the red-green wavelength zones in all the subjects. The EnChroma\nglasses diminish the capacity of the CVD subjects to name correctly the green, the\nyellow and the red between the monochromatic stimuli in green-red wavelength zone.\nConclusion: The color naming procedure with monochromatic stimuli represents the best possibility\nto characterize the color vison performances through the selective chromatic filters.","title":"Color Vision Performances through the EnChroma Glasses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185176\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Universite de Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kevin Bastien, Dave Saint-Amour, Jean-Marie Hanssens, Vasile Diaconu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al, UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al, Universite de Montreal, Universite de Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This case highlights the need to carefully\nmonitor for potential devastating ocular complications and shows the benefit of using\ncontrast sensitivity (CS) testing in assessing the visual impact of optic neuropathy.\n\nCase Report: An 82-year-old Caucasian female presented for an exam in May 2017 to obtain new eyeglasses\napproximately six weeks after cataract surgery in the right eye. She complained, however,\nof no improvement in vision following surgery.\nReview of systems revealed\na history of chemotherapy and surgery in January 2016 for gastric cancer. She also\nhad a history of vision loss after amiodarone had been prescribed in the summer of\n2015 for heart arrhythmia. The drug was used for several months, then discontinued\nby a neuro-ophthalmologist due to optic disc edema and subsequent bilateral optic\nneuropathy.\nCataract surgery with monofocal IOL, previously delayed due to\nother health concerns, was performed OD in March 2017 due to persistent vision complaints\nprimarily in the right eye. The surgeon did express uncertainty regarding the visual\noutcome given the ocular history. After an uneventful surgery and post-operative course,\nthe patient's VA improved by several lines OD. Unfortunately, she reported little\nvisual improvement and the surgeon explained that damage from amiodarone was to blame.\nPost-operative\nexamination revealed mild residual refractive error with best-corrected distance VA\nof 20/30+ OD and 20/30- OS. Letter CS testing using isolated 20/100 (6cpd) Sloan letters\non a calibrated electronic chart showed CS thresholds of 16% OD and 5% OS indicating\nsevere visual impairment OD and mild impairment OS. Additional testing with an OCT\nrevealed thinning of the central macula and GCC, much greater OD than OS. The patient\nalso showed visual field defects OU, affecting the right eye more centrally.\nNew\nglasses were prescribed to enhance distance and near vision as much as possible, and\nthe patient was given additional counseling regarding the asymmetric complications\nfrom amiodarone.\nConclusion: Although amiodarone can be life-saving, it can also lead to significant systemic and\nocular morbidity. Optic nerve complications occur in 1-2% of patients on the medication\nand can lead to severe vision loss including blindness. For this reason, patients\non this drug should be watched closely for signs of optic nerve toxicity which are\noften insidious and can be unilateral.\nIn this case, CS testing was more\neffective than VA testing in assessing the visual impact of drug complications and\ncorrelated well with findings from additional medical evaluation. Valuable insight\ngained with CS testing can also be beneficial for pre-operative counseling and can\nhelp in setting realistic patient expectations.","title":"Contrast Sensitivity Testing Reveals Visual Impact of Asymmetric Amiodarone Optic  Neuropathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185156\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Allisonvile Eye Care Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Our aim was to model mfERG waveforms using a custom Fourier curve fitting\nalgorithm and automatically extract N1 and P1 amplitudes and peak times for the standard\nsix ring averages of the mfERG.\nMethods: A 103-hexagon stimulus array was used to elicit mfERG (Veris Pro 6.4.5, Electro-Diagnostic\nImaging, Inc., Milpitas, CA) responses from 20 normal subjects. Groups of responses\nfrom the mfERG trace array of each subject's right eye were averaged to yield datasets\ncontaining six ring averages from different retinal eccentricities (fovea to perifovea)\nfor each subject. Raw amplitude data were extracted for the six rings and waveforms\nwere reconstructed using custom Matlab software (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). A Fourier\ncurve was fit to the waveforms using different equations that varied from 1 to 8 terms.\nRoot mean squared error (RMSE) was used to assess goodness of fit for each of the\nresulting equations. N1 and P1 amplitudes and peak times were extracted from the optimal\ncurve fit by identifying instances when the first derivative of the Fourier equation\nequaled zero within the first 60 ms. Mean N1 and P1 amplitude and peak time from curve\nfitting analysis were compared to the Veris system using a paired t-test. Amplitudes\nand peak times from a patient testing genetically positive for Huntington's disease\n(HD), but without clinical manifestations, was used to test the effectiveness of the\ncurve fitting model.\nResults: As expected, the Fourier equation with the highest number of terms considered (8)\nproduced the mathematical model with the lowest RMSE. Given the RMSE trajectory, additional\nterms would not meaningfully improve the goodness of fit. Using the optimum curve\nfit, there were no differences between the Veris data and mathematical modeling for\nthe six rings in N1 amplitudes (paired t-test p-value range: 0.828ˆ’0.986) or peak\ntimes (paired t-test p-value range: 0.531ˆ’0.910). There was also no difference in\nP1 amplitudes for the six rings (paired t-test p-value range: 0.942ˆ’0.992) or peak\ntimes (paired t-test p-value range: 0.223ˆ’0.998). N1 and P1 amplitudes for all six\nrings for a presymptomatic HD patient fell outside the normative 95% confidence interval\nfor both the Veris and mathematical model.\nConclusion: Custom curve fitting using a Fourier model effectively represents mfERG waveforms,\ncan objectively and accurately identify N1 and P1 for all six standard rings of the\n103-hexagon mfERG, and can detect subtle vision function differences in systemic disease.\nLastly, the model presented here may be of use to calculate N1 and P1 amplitude and\npeak time for the 103 individual waveforms in the mfERG trace array to help detect\nfocal areas of maculopathy.","title":"Mathematical Modeling of the Multifocal Electroretinogram using Fourier Curve Fitting  Analysis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185159\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Dean VanNasdale, Julie Racine\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, Nationwide Children's Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Informed consent\nwas taken from the patients and was approved by Institutional Review Board. A total\nof 32 participants; 16 cases of dry ARMD, 8 from wet ARMD and 8 normal subjects from\ncohort of age matched normal population. Prior to pupillary dilation visual function\nexaminations included distance visual acuity (VA), near VA, contrast sensitivity (CS),\ncolour vision (CV) and central visual field (VF) measured with logMAR, Jaegar, Pelli-Robson\ncharts, Fransworth D15 colour vision test and Amsler Grid respectively.

The mean best corrected visual\nacuities (BCVA) were significantly different (0.06 ± 0.07 LogMAR, 0.65 ± 0.34 LogMAR\nand 1.12 ± 0.61 LogMAR for normal, dry ARMD and wet ARMD respectively). The mean BCVAs\nfor near were 1.00M, 2.48 ± 2.32M and 5.23 ± 3.33 M in normal, dry ARMD and wet, respectively.\nARMD and normal were significantly different for CS, 1.89 ± .04, 1.15 ± 0.44 and 0.65\n± 0.67 log units for normal, dry ARMD and wet ARMD, respectively. The CV was normal\nin normal subjects while it was abnormal (tritan defect) in 13 (81.25%) of dry ARMD\nand all the wet ARMD. The central VF was normal for 10 (62.5%) of dry ARMD and all\nnormal subjects and abnormal in all the wet ARMD subjects. The Pearson correlation\nshowed the strong association between the average P1 amplitude of rings 1,2 and 3\nwith BCVA (r = -0.687, p< 0.01), near VA (r = -0.707, p<0.01), CS (r = 0.688,\np< 0.01), CV (r = -0.359, p<0.01) and the central VF (r = 0.486, p<0.01)\nrespectively. The Pearson correlation showed significant association between the average\nN1 amplitude of rings 1,2 and 3 with BCVA (r = -0.642, p<0.01), near VA (r = -0.623,\np<0.01), CS (r = 0.643, p<0.01), CV (r = -0.418, p<0.05) and central VF (r\n= -0.518, p<0.01).

This study\nwill examine the effect of blue light filters on the blink rate and the blink quality.\nMethods: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and participants signed\na statement of informed consent prior to enrollment. Participants in this study weree\nsubjects with good ocular health, a minimum near visual acuity (NVA) of J2, a minimum\ndistance visual acuity (DVA, Snellen) of 6/9 and a within normal distance (DCT) and\nnear (NCT) cover test results. With and without the blue light filter (Cyxus, Blue\nLight Blocking Computer Glasses), the blink rate and the number of incomplete blinks\nwere measured by using a slow-motion Iphone 6s camera. The right eye of each participant\nwas recorded while watching two short films (15 minutes each, on a Samsung tablet,\n9.7 Inch size, 40 cm distance). Randomly chosen, half of the subjects watched the\nfirst film with the filter, and the other half started in the reverse order. The number\nof full and incomplete blinks (with and without filter) was measured as a function\nof time (every five minutes), taking into account that concentration and fatigue could\naffect outcomes (Stern, 1994).

Up to\n90% of individuals experience significant ocular and visual symptoms when viewing\ndigital screens. Previous work has shown changes in blink patterns and the position\nof the upper eyelid when reading from electronic displays. This study sought to determine\nwhether these changes are produced by variations in autonomic innervation to the eye\nduring the course of a sustained near task.\nMethods: The study was performed on 25 young, visually-normal subjects, who participated in\n2 experimental sessions. In the first, subjects were required to read from an electronic\nreader for a continuous 20 minute period at a distance of 40cm. In the second trial,\nsubjects fixated a 0.1 cpd Difference of Gaussian grating at a distance of 40cm. While\nfixating this stimulus, subjects were given two mental tasks, namely either counting\nbackwards in intervals of 1 or 7, for a 10 minute period. To assess autonomic innervation\nthe following parameters were quantified during the trials: heart rate (HR), blood\npressure, pupil size, vertical palpebral aperture dimension, blink rate and prevalence\nof incomplete blinks. At the end of each session, subjects completed a questionnaire\nconcerning symptoms of eyestrain, ocular discomfort and dry eye experienced during\nthe task.\nResults: While reading from the electronic device produced a high symptom score, the only parameters\nwhich showed significant post-task changes following the reading task were HR (mean\ndecrease = 8.56 bpm; p < 0.001) and incomplete blinking (the percentage of blinks\ndeemed incomplete increased by 30.6%; p < 0.001). Both counting tasks also produced\na significant decrease in HR (mean decrease = 9.1 bpm and 5.0 bpm; p < 0.001 and\np < 0.005, for counting in 1's and 7's, respectively), and a decrease in the percentage\nof blinks recorded as incomplete (mean decrease = 13.3% and 12.0%; both p < 0.05,\nfor counting in 1's and 7's, respectively).\nConclusion: While marked symptoms of digital eye strain were observed immediately after reading\nfrom a digital screen, these symptoms were not associated with changes in autonomic\ninnervation to the eye. Accordingly, it appears that digital eye strain and the concurrent\nchanges in blink amplitude do not result from the cognitive demand of the near-vision\ntask.","title":"Autonomic Innervation and Digital Eye Strain","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185163\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York, College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Mark Rosenfield, Joan Portello\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York, College of Optometry, State University of New York, College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

{"_type":"dict","author":"Brandon Call","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/the-visual-effects-of-virtual-reality-gameplay","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Virtual reality devices are used for many purposes, including entertainment, recreation,\nand education. As these devices continue to increase in popularity, it is important\nto identify any potential health ramifications. Individuals who use virtual reality\ndevices can experience symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, altered vision, etc. Within\nthe video gaming community, this collective group of symptoms has been deemed \"virtual\nreality sickness\". Currently, several theories exist that attempt to explain the exact\netiology and pathophysiology of virtual reality sickness. The aim of the current study\nwas to investigate one of these theories; does the use of a virtual reality device\nalter a person's vision?\nMethods: Thirty-two subjects were recruited for the study on a self-volunteer basis. Objective\ndata on amplitude of accommodation (AA), near phoria, near point of convergence (NPC),\nnear visual acuity (NVA) and near stereo-acuity was gathered immediately before and\nafter 20-30 minutes of gameplay using the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. Before\nusing the Rift, patients completed a questionnaire asking about prior use of VR or\nhistory of health concerns such as motion sickness, vertigo, or stroke. After using\nthe Rift, patients were asked to report any symptoms of subjective discomfort. Paired\nt-tests and ANOVA were performed to compare objective and subjective assessments within\nand between these groups.\nResults: Paired t-tests revealed no significant difference (all p > 0.05) in near stereo-acuity,\nNVA, AA, near phoria, NPC-break and NPC-recovery pre vs post VR gameplay in all 32\nof the subjects. When the subjects were divided into two groups based on prior use\nof VR (21 subjects had used VR before and 11 did not) ANOVA revealed no significant\ndifference (all p > 0.05) for pre vs post gameplay within and between the groups.\nAfter using the Rift, 19 of the 32 subjects reported at least one symptom of subjective\ndiscomfort despite no significant change in objective visual data. ANOVA revealed\nno significant difference (all p > 0.05) for pre vs post-VR experience within and\nbetween the groups.\nConclusion: None of the objective visual data gathered from all 32 of the subjects showed significant\nchange after using the Oculus Rift. However, over half of the subjects had some sort\nof subjective discomfort after just 20-30 minutes of gameplay. This initial research\nattempt speculates the possibility that VR changes observed in most symptomatic individuals\narise out of perceptual changes rather than changes in the visual system. Further\nstudies should test this hypothesis as well as involve a larger sample size, a longer\nduration of VR gameplay, and additional methods of vision testing.","title":"The Visual Effects of Virtual Reality Gameplay","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185165\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Balamurali Vasudevan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

In most situations, this would result in a global dampening of the visual\nfield. In a cornea that has been reshaped by orthokeratology, refractive error is\nartificially redistributed in the cornea, which could adversely affect sensitivity\nof the visual field. The aim of this study is to determine if any unusual patterns\nof visual field dampening occur in subjects using orthokeratology.\nMethods: This study investigated threshold visual field sensitivity in 25 healthy young myopes\n(between 0.50 and 4.50D of myopia, with less than 1.00D of astigmatism) before and\nafter orthokeratology.

Participants were randomized\nto receive LV devices without therapy or LV devices with LV rehabilitation (instruction\nto teach use of remaining vision, LV devices and environmental modification) after\ntheir LV examination. Costs were compared between groups to look at the effects of\napplying VA vs. Medicare rates in the cost calculation.\n\nResults: Total VA healthcare costs per patient were $1662 ($671 SD) for the LV devices without\ntherapy group and $1788 ($864 SD) for the LV rehabilitation group. Using Medicare\nreimbursement rates, total health care costs per patient were $1468 ($580 SD) for\nthe LV devices without therapy group and $1736 ($897 SD) for the LV rehabilitation\ngroup. Total healthcare costs using VA rates are slightly higher than those for Medicare\nreimbursement due to differences in allowable charges.

An optometrist\nevaluates if the patient is able to meet the local visual requirements for licensure.\nAdditionally, a bioptic telescope may be prescribed and requires training. The optometrist\nalso works in conjunction with occupational therapy and certified driver instructors\nfor bioptic use and driving evaluation/training. The aim of this study is to investigate\nthe incidence of driving as a goal and the outcomes.\nMethods: This retrospective study investigated the goal of driving in a population of patients\nwith visual impairment. 500 medical records were randomly reviewed from a low vision\nclinic with dates of service from 2007-2017. Data was collected from new patients\nthat were referred into the clinic from an OD or MD. Data collected include age, diagnosis,\nacuity, functional vision, refraction, devices and referrals. Data was excluded from\nfiles in which the patient was not old enough to drive (n=21). All 8 examining optometrists\nwere residency trained in low vision and 4 had achieved American Academy of Optometry\nLow Vision Diplomate status.\nResults: 58 patients had driving as a goal; this is 12% of the charts reviewed. Of this cohort\n16 patients, 28% had entering visual acuity that met licensure requirements. Seven\nof these 16 patients were referred to driver rehabilitation and 7 for occupational\ntherapy services. Eleven patients, 19% of this group, had their visual acuity improved\nthrough trial frame refraction to enable them to meet licensure requirements. Of these\n11 patients, 2 were referred to occupational therapy and 3 to driver rehabilitation.\nTwenty patients, 34%, were prescribed a bioptic telescope. Of this group, 7 were referred\nto occupational therapy and 12 for driver rehabilitation. Six patients, 10%, were\neligible for bioptic licensure but 4 declined and 2 were considering. Five patients,\n9%, had visual acuity too poor to qualify for even the bioptic telescope category.\nOf the 58 patients, 47 patients or 81% were able to meet their driving goal. The low\nvision examination, by prescription of bioptic or increased visual acuity through\nrefraction, enabled 31 patients, or 53%, for driving. The average magnification of\nthe prescribed bioptic was 3.06x with average visual acuity of 20/33 through the telescope.\nConclusion: Majority of patients with a goal of driving were eligible to achieve this goal. The\nlow vision examination can maximize visual ability and prescribe bioptic telescopes\nto meet driver requirements. In addition, the referral for training with the bioptic\nand driver rehabilitation are an important part of the process.","title":"Incidence and outcomes of Driving as a goal in a low vision population","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185149\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kara Crumbliss, Elise Corgiat\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Chicago Lighthouse for People who are Blind or Visually, The Chicago Lighthouse for People who are Blind or Visually\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study\nelucidated self-reported optometric practice patterns for patients with mild vision\nloss, including the barriers to providing LV management strategies. The identification\nof modifiable barriers will then inform targeted education programs for optometrists.\nMethods: A total of 185 anonymous surveys were completed online or in-person via paper handouts\nby actively practicing optometrists in the US. The survey inquired about the frequency\nof providing LV management for patients with mild vision loss and also to identify\nthe top five barriers that prevent them from offering LV management (including visual\naids or referal).\nResults: Of the survey respondents, 26% practice some LV and/or completed an LV residency,\n28% completed an optometric residency, and 46% did neither. The most commonly reported\nbarrier to LV services was \"cost of the LV exam and/or devices\". The second most common\nbarrier was that \"patients are not interested or would not go to an LV exam,\" which\nwas indicated by 55% of respondents. Other potentially modifiable, common barriers\nwere: lack of equipment, specifically, that \"it is not feasible to stock magnifiers\nin office\" (29%), lack of a local LV provider (28%), uncertain benefit from LV services\n(17%), lack of proficiency with high adds (13%), lack of time (12%), and a burdensome\nreferral process (9%). Among those who do not practice LV, there was a significantly\ngreater odds of reporting that it was uncertain if the patient would benefit from\nLV services among male practitioners (OR=3.1; p=0.015) or those who indicated greater\nvisual acuity loss as a criteria for LV referral (OR=1.28 for every 0.1 log unit increase;\np=0.025). The odds of reporting lack of time as a barrier was significantly related\nto increased patient volume per day (OR=1.09; p=0.018).

These findings were identical across all types of services.\nConclusion: People with visual impairment were most receptive to receiving information about rehabilitation\nservices verbally, from their doctor, at the time of diagnosis of vision impairment.\nBased on this study's findings, a diagnosis of vision impairment should trigger notification\nof all possible low vision and rehabilitation services immediately.","title":"Doctor Tell Me What Can Help A Qualitative Study about Timing of Access to Low Vision  and Rehabilitation Services","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185151\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of New South Wales\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Isabelle Jalbert, pelayia Berdoukas, Mei Ying Boon\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of New South Wales, University of New South Wales, School of Optometry and Vision Science\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

A common method to evoke empathy,\n\"blindness simulations\", can misrepresent and highlight the initial shock of becoming\nblind, neglecting the adaptation process which often follows. Such experiences leave\nparticipants feeling discouraged, lowering their expectations of the visually impaired\n(VI). Simulation improvements may involve educating participants on strategies and\ntherapies used to overcome vision loss. The purpose of this study was to evaluate\nthe pre/post empathy levels of optometry students using low vision simulators (LVS)\nrendering moderate macular degeneration in conjunction with low vision rehabilitation\n(eccentric viewing and independent cane travel).\n\nMethods:\nA pre/post questionnaire, modified from the Social Responsibility about Blindness\nScale, was performed to assess the attitudes and underlying expectations subjects\nhad regarding the VI population. Distance visual acuity in the right, left, and both\neyes were measured using an ETDRS chart, best corrected and with the LVS, respectively.\nSubjects' mobility, using the LVS, was also assessed on a pre-determined course. Subjects\nreceived verbal eccentric viewing (EV) training and practiced identifying faces of\ncommon celebrities. Distance acuity with the LVS were measured after the EV training.\nSubject then received mobility cane training (identifying obstacles) and were timed\nre-walking the course while using the cane.\n\nResults:\nAll participants (n = 23) were 2nd/3rd year graduate students in an optometric\nprogram. The average age was 25.2 years and 87% were female. 30% of participants had\nsome prior low vision exposure (personal interaction). A 14.49% increase (p = 0.002)\nwas noted among participants interested in practicing low vision upon graduation.\nPositively worded statements regarding the visually impaired populations ability to\nwork and live independently improved, but only reached statistical significance regarding\nthe motivational impact on others (p = 0.002).

Gauging\nnon-optometry LV rehabilitation professionals' perceptions of LV optometry may be\nuseful in promoting positive interprofessional relationships. These positive relationships\nmay ultimately improve LV rehabilitation outcomes through better continuity of care\nfor the patient.\nMethods: An anonymous 13-question survey was administered to various vision rehabilitation\nprofessionals via an electronic survey created and managed on www.QuestionPro.com.\nA recruitment email with a link to the QuestionPro survey was sent to at least 95\nvision rehabilitation professionals in various rehabilitation settings throughout\nMichigan, including a Veteran's Affairs rehabilitation clinic, a non-profit rehabilitation\nclinic, a university's vision rehabilitation department, a number of school districts\nin Michigan, and a state vision rehabilitation bureau.

LVR is individually designed depending on patients' needs\nand complaints which vary tremendously. However, there is little research addressing\nthe needs for visual improvement of visually impaired patients in China. For a better\nunderstanding of the needs of Chinese patients with visual impairment, we did this\nstudy.\nMethods: This is a cross-sectional study collecting detailed information of patients attending\nthe low vision center at The Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between January\n2015 and January 2017.\nPatients whose best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was\nless than 6/12 were included. Before examinations, a questionnaire interview, including\ndemographic information (age, gender, address) and needs for visual improvement was\nconducted. Questionnaires for children less than 10 years old were answered by guardians.\nThen, habitual VA, BCVA (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study or Feinbloom),\ncontrast sensitivity (when required) (the Mars Letter Contrast Sensitivity Test),\nslit-lamp examination and fundus examinations were performed by low vision specialists.\nThe reasons and rate of visual impairment were determined.\nThe study adhered to\nthe tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee\nof The Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Verbal informed consent was obtained\nfrom study participants or legal guardians.\nResults: The main need of visual improvement was engagement in hobbies (68.9%), followed by\nreading (20.9%), engaging in occupation (20.1%) and watching TV or movies (17.1%).\nLess than 10% of patients mentioned the demand of using public transportation (5.8%),\ndoing housework (3.7%), writing (1.9%), walking (1.5%), driving (1.1%) and others\n(2.4%).\nIn the multivariate regression model, women were significantly associated\nwith a concern for performing hobbies (OR 1.45, 95%CI 1.0- 2.0) but associated with\nlower odds of reading (OR 0.46, 95%CI 0.3-0.7). Older subjects were more willing to\nchoose hobbies (OR 1.35[per 10-year increase], 95%CI 1.3-1.4), reading (OR 1.11[per\n10-year increase], 95%CI 1.0-1.2), watching TV or movies (OR 1.4[per 10-year increase],\n95%CI 1.3-1.6) and housework (OR 1.21[per 10-year increase], 95%CI 1.0-1.5) than younger\nindividuals. In comparison with younger participants, older individuals were less\nlikely to choose an occupation (OR 0.53[per 10-year increase], 95%CI 0.5-0.6). No\nsignificant association was found between visual acuity and any needs for visual improvement.\nConclusion: Hobbies, reading, engaging in occupation and watching TV were the most common needs\nfor visual rehabilitation in patients with visual impairment. Visual acuity was not\nassociated with visual rehabilitation needs, but gender and age showed a modest influence\non the choice of different needs.","title":"The Needs for Visual Improvement of Patients Presented at Low Vision Center in Wenzhou  China","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185154\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Xiaoman Li, Guofu Chen, Ruzhi Deng, Na Lin, Lingzhi Ni, Longfei Jiang, Haishuang Lin, Frank Thorn, Jie Chen\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The Classification\nCode of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) explicitly details the need for\nthe development and implementation of robust classification systems that are evidence-based\nand sport-specific. A study addressing the appropriate criteria for shooting is reported\nhere. The study aimed to establish the minimum level of vision impairment necessary\nto compete in visually impaired (VI) shooting by testing the level of simulated impairment\nthat would reduce performance in athletes without vision impairment.\n\nMethods: Elite able-sighted athletes (n=27) shot under standard conditions with their habitual\nvision, and with their vision impaired by the use of simulation spectacles (filters\nwhich reduce both VA and CS) and refractive blur (lenses which reduce VA with less\neffect on CS). Habitual shooting scores were used to establish a 99% confidence interval\nfor \"˜expected' performance in order to determine when shooting performance was \"˜below\nexpected' in the presence of vision impairment. Logistic regression and decision tree\nanalyses were then used to assess the relationship between visual function and shooting\nperformance.\nResults: Shooting performance remained relatively stable for initial decreases in visual acuity\n(VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS), and then quickly deteriorated with more severe\nloss. The analysis techniques converged to reveal that CS was a better predictor of\nperformance than VA. A VA cut-off of 0.6 logMAR (as compared to current criteria of\nvisual acuity of 1.0 logMAR or worse) combined with a CS cut-off of 1.3 logCS (not\nused for classification presently) best predicted \"˜below expected' performance.\nConclusion: The results help to work towards a sport-specific evidence-based system of classification\nfor VI shooting and suggest that measurement of CS should be included in classification.\nThe outcomes help foster a more inclusive form of shooting for people with vision\nimpairment.","title":"Setting the Classification Standards for Paralympic Shooters with Vision Impairment","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185155\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Anglia Ruskin University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Keziah Latham, David Mann, Rianne Ravensbergen, Joy Myint\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Anglia Ruskin University, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, University of Hertfordshire\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The perimetry\ndescribes the extent of the field of view with the device but does not show any of\nthe other visual effects of the perceived scene through the devices. A method to record\nand veridically depict the perceived scene would be helpful in testing, documenting,\nand illustrating the effects of visual aids and for analyzing secondary yet important\ndetails. Simply taking a picture behind a visual aid does not provide an accurate\nrepresentation of the scene perceived by a user. Various parameters should be considered,\nincluding distance from the camera entrance pupil to the front surface of the lens,\nback vertex distance from the spectacles, and camera aperture size. We developed a\nnovel camera-based system with a 3D-printed spectacle frame holder to record the effects\nof visual aids mounted on spectacle lenses as seen by a human eye.\nMethods: The entrance pupil of the human eye is ~4 mm behind the cornea and a spectacle lens\nis positioned ~13 mm in front of the surface of the cornea, for a total distance of\n~17 mm. In contrast, the entrance pupil of a camera is typically more than 20 mm behind\nthe front surface of the camera lens, making it impossible to position a visual aid\nat the correct distance to accurately depict the effects on the field of view. While\nsuch cameras in smartphones allow for correct positioning of the spectacle lens, the\naperture size is much smaller than the pupil of the human eye. In mirrorless digital\ncameras with pancake lenses, the entrance pupil is closer to the front surface of\nthe camera lens and records a wide field of view. We developed a 3D-printed spectacle\nframe holder to place the lens with the visual aid 17 mm in front of the entrance\npupil of the camera lens (Sony Î±6000 with SEL16F28 lens, 73° field of view). The aperture\nsize of the eye was simulated by adjusting the F-number of the lens.\nResults: We demonstrated the functionality of the device with various visual aids: peripheral\nprism glasses, bioptic telescopes, and image minifier. The correct depiction of the\nperceived scene was verified with the functionality measured in the perimetry. In\naddition, visually observed effects of the visual aids such as spatial distortions,\ndimming, reduced contrast, boundary effects (partial blur and multiplexing) at the\nedges, and magnification/minification and spatial multiplexing effect of the bioptic\ntelescope/image minifier were captured and visualized by the proposed device.\nConclusion: Our novel system can record and depict the scene perceived through any spectacle mounted\nvisual aid.

His entering acuities were light perception\nright eye (OD), and no light perception left eye (OS). He reported efficient ambulation\naround his house, but has difficulty outdoors. His goals were to become more proficient\nwith his white cane, and to be more proficient with household chores.\nA dilated\nocular health examination revealed normal anterior segment findings, normotensive\nintraocular pressures, and subluxated intraocular lenses OD > OS, with the zonules\nadhering superiorly OS. There was complete retinal and choroidal atrophy OD, OS, including\natrophy of both maculae. He was asked to return in 1 week to assess his glare and\nlight sensitivities without his eyes being dilated.\nAt his 1 week follow\nup, a variety of tinted lenses and fit-overs were trialed. The patient preferred the\ndarkest gray fit-overs since it blocked out the most glare and light giving him better\nvisual comfort. A talking watch was also dispensed. He was referred to orientation\nand mobility and living skills departments within the Long Beach VA Blind Rehabilitation\nCenter.\nAfter 6 weeks of inpatient care with orientation and mobility training\nand living skills, the patient reported more confidence in safely walking around with\nhis white cane using a wide sweeping technique. His safety awareness with his household\nchores also improved with the placement of tactile bumps on the microwave, stove,\nand refrigerator.\nConclusion:\nConclusion:\nRadiation causes endothelial cell injury which will initially\naffect the retinal capillaries; however, this can be followed by retinal ischemia/vascular\nobliteration causing optic neuropathy and severe vision loss. The risk of radiation\nchorioretinopathy increases with radiation dosage, fraction size, and preexisting\nvascular disorders. Multiple studies have shown a total dosage higher than 1,100 Gray\nunits can cause retinopathy. In one study, 9 out of 10 patients who received more\nthan 6,800 Gray units had complete loss of vision.\nRadiation exposure can\nlead to devastating vision loss particularly when the retinal and choroidal circulation\nare damaged. This case illustrated the importance of referring patients with radiation\nchorioretinpathy for low vision services. Orientation and mobility training, and living\nskill services can help individuals improve their quality of life and regain some\ntheir independence.","title":"Vascular Obliteration of the Choroid and Retina Secondary to Radiation Exposure","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185141\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Long Beach VA\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Edward Chu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Long Beach VA\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Neuroimaging techniques\ntypically identify brain lesions associated with specific VF defects in cases of PCS.\nWe present a rare case of PCS with an absence of any correlation between neuroimaging\nand a right inferior homonymous quadrantanopia defect progressing to a bilateral inferior\naltitudinal hemianopia. This 18-month case study evaluates the progression of VF loss\nand provides a low vision rehabilitation protocol for improving visual function and\nquality of life.\n\nCase Report: A 43-year-old female sustained head impact to her left temporal-frontal region from\nan automobile accident. A neurological exam including magnetic resonance imaging was\nnegative for any neurological pathology. Humphrey VF 24-2 (Threshold test) showed\na congruous right inferior homonymous quadrantanopia, suggesting a lesion in the left\nparietal optic radiation. Magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography\nimages were also negative with only mild vessel malformations. Optical coherence tomography\nevaluation of both optic nerve head and macula were normal. A B-scan ocular ultrasound\nand extended dilated retinal exam were also unremarkable. Our patient experienced\ncommon PCS symptoms including difficulty reading, performing her work and doing normal\nhousehold activities. We monitored VF, ocular health and visual functional abilities\nduring an 18-month period. The VF, repeated 10 times, showed a rate of progression\nfor right eye (OD) of -14.6 ± 10.9% / year (95% confidence) and in the left eye (OS)\na rate of progression -23.4 ± 18.6% / year (95% confidence). The Visual Field Index\nreduced to 60% OD and 48% OS, correlating with patient symptoms and awareness of the\nvisual loss. We continue to manage the patient using a visual rehabilitation protocol\nwith goals of enhancing visual function, adaptive behavior, life skills and quality\nof life. Also, in coordination with her neurologist, she is receiving ongoing standard\nPCS management.\nConclusion: Our case presents a post-traumatic VF defect that is progressive and without correlating\npathology visible with various imaging techniques. Therefore, the mechanism of her\nvisual symptoms causing the VF defect is unknown. Although, neuronal damage, on a\nmicroscopic level, is hypothesized as an explanation for the cause of many PCS symptoms.\nPCS cases require close monitoring with an integrated medical care team.

At this time it is unclear whether there is a natural progression,\nor these deficits are in response to febrile episodes, or both.\nPurpose\nIn\nthis case series, we characterize the functional changes in HARS Syndrome, caused\nby homozygous mutations in the HARS gene (c.1361A>C; p.Tyr454Ser). This syndrome,\nwhich occurs in among the Old Order Amish population, was originally described as\nUsher syndrome (variant 3B) and causes a deficiency in histidyl-tRNA synthetase. Children\nwith HARS develop sensorineural hearing loss in the first decade and are prone to\nsometimes life-threatening, acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with viral\nillnesses.\nMethods: We retrospectively reviewed the natural history and vision assessments in 13 genetically\nconfirmed cases of HARS (ages 2-15 years). ISCEV standard ERGs were recorded in 7\ncases (ages 7-16 years). OCT images were taken in 7 cases (aged 5-14).\nResults: All children in whom optometric data were available had some degree of visual acuity\ndeficit (levels slightly below normal for their age), and all had an abnormal fundoscopy\nin some aspect. None had total, permanent vision loss, although 2 had a significant\nvisual impairment (visual acuity approximately 6/48). In association with febrile\nillnesses, 7 children experienced acute transient visual loss all followed by partial\nrecovery according to parental report, and 8 children experienced visual hallucinations.\nSome had reports of fever episodes, for which 3 were hospitalised, but with no reported\neffects on vision.\nCentral fundus signs included attenuation of the retinal vessels,\nabsent foveal reflexes, optic nerve pallor, and a granular appearance of the macula.\nPigmentary retinopathy affecting the peripheral fundus or rod-cone dystrophy was noted\nin five children, all 8 years or older.\nNyctalopia was reported for 2 children\nand was possible for another two. Additionally, several children reported photophobia.\nOf the 8 children who could perform a color vision test, defects were present in 6\nchildren, 3 showing a B/Y and 3 a R/G deficit. Visual fields were measured in 2 individuals\nand both showed a central scotoma.\nAll those tested showed substantial deficits\nin light adapted ERGs with disproportionate reductions of the oscillatory potentials\n(OPs) and b-waves. The severity of ERG deficits corresponds to the visual deficits\nand included loss of the other light-adapted waveforms (a-waves, flicker ERGs). The\ndark-adapted ERGs were relatively preserved but showed reduced amplitudes and non-detectable\nOPs. OCTs show disturbance of the perimacular retinal layers.\nConclusion: The retinal dystrophy in HARS Syndrome presents as a cone-rod dystrophy with early\nsubtle maculopathy and multiple functional deficits, sometimes associated with febrile\nepisodes.","title":"Visual function in HARS Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185143\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo School of Optometry & Vision Science\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Daphne McCulloch, Natalie Hutchings, Victoria Siu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo School of Optometry & Vision Science, University of Waterloo School of Optometry & Vision Science, University of Western Ontario\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Vision-Function-Scale person scores were compared to the visual field area\nmeasured using a Goldmann perimeter, the total point score for the combined 30-2 and\n30/60-1 Humphrey Field Analyzer programs (HFA), 30-Hz full-field cone electroretinogram\n(ERG) amplitude, and ETDRS visual acuity. Changes in person scores over time were\nexamined. The mixed-effects models used account for repeated measures.\nResults: The Rasch model of the Vision Function Scale responses had person separation of 2.23,\nperson reliability of 0.83, item separation of 23.4 and item reliability of 1.00.\nThe Vision-Function-Scale person scores were correlated with Goldmann (z=6.70; p<\n0.0001), HFA (z=7.95, p<0.001), ERG amplitude (z=7.35, p<0.001), and visual\nacuity (z=9.06, p<0.001). Over the five-year period there was a reduction in person\nscores from 1.8 to 1.4 logits (z=9.34, p<0.001). For the full sample, person scores\nreduced 0.45 logits per decade (z= 11.4; p<0.0001).

The aim\nof this study was to investigate prescribing trends in a low vision clinic of optical\nmagnification vs assistive technology over the last decade.\nMethods: This retrospective study investigated prescribing trends for near visual goals. 500\nmedical records were randomly reviewed in a low vision clinic with date of service\nfrom 2007-2017. The low vision rehabilitation examination was done by one of 8 optometrists.\nAll optometrists were residency trained in low vision and 4 had achieved American\nAcademy of Optometry Low Vision Diplomate status. Data was collected on what was prescribed\nfor near visual goals. Optical devices were considered microscopes +4 and over, hand\nheld and stand magnifiers. Assistive technology included electronic magnification\ndevices, magnification smartphone apps and text enlargement on computer.\nResults: The data shows that assistive technology prescription has increased and optical magnification\nhas stayed steady. The percentage of patient's prescribed assistive technology was\n40% in 2008 (none in 2007) with the trend of increasing to 89% in 2017. The percentage\nof patients' prescribed optical magnification was 100% in 2007 and has stayed between\n80-96% through 2017, with the exception of one year 2016. That year optical magnification\nprescription dropped to 38%. Also during that year, there was an increased prescription\nof portable electronic magnifiers, 34 units, compared to all other years that had\neach had under 22 units prescribed. When the data was broken down by age groups, optical\nmagnification prescription was similar across all groups (79-91%) and prescription\nof assistive technology decreased with increasing age. The youngest age groups were\nprescribed assistive technology in 72% of cases and the oldest age group 36%.\nConclusion: The prescription of assistive technology is increasing and prescription of optical\nmagnification is continuing to stay stable. More patients are selecting both electronic\nand optical devices to meet their needs. Even with the rapid evolution and availability\nof assistive technology, prescription of optical magnification continues to be a viable\nand preferred option for patients with visual impairment, especially in the oldest\ncohort. Low vision examinations should continue to include both optical magnification\nand assistive technology solutions for patients with visual impairment.","title":"Prescribing Trends of Optical Magnification vs Assistive Technology for Near Visual  Goals from 2007 to 2017 in a Low Vision Rehabilitation Clinic","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185145\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Elise Corgiat, Kara Crumbliss\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Chicago Lighthouse for People who are Blind or Visually, The Chicago Lighthouse for People who are Blind or Visually\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Each Teller\nAcuity Card (TAC) presents a single square area with the grating target on a grey\nbackground which may have an edge artifact or contrast difference enhancing detection\nof the grating. The UC Berkeley (UCB) Cards present two targets; the grating and a\nsquare of matched luminance on a grey background requiring a forced choice to locate\nthe grating. A direct comparison of TAC to UCB grating acuity was evaluated through\na retrospective, observational clinical study.\nMethods: Binocular grating visual acuity was measured during a comprehensive vision examination\nof 51 patients with and without disabilities (ages 6 mo-35 yr; mean 8.26 yr). Visual\nacuities with the TAC and UCB cards were measured using the modified acuity card procedure\nwith 3 out of 4 correct as the acuity threshold. Only 6 of the 16 TAC cards that were\nmost comparable in acuity demands to the 6 UCB Cards were used to equalize testing\ntimes. Testing distances ranged from 55 to 165 cm with the initial distance depending\non the age of the patient. Testing order for the TAC and UCB cards was randomized.\nResults: Grating acuity was converted from cycles/deg into logMAR values for analysis. The\nranges for visual acuity were: TAC -0.02 to 1.1 logMAR; UCB cards 0 to 1.08 logMAR\nwith the regression equation comparing TAC to UCB grating acuity in logMAR (y = 0.96x\n+ 0.08, R2 = 0.76). A Bland Altman analysis (mean vs. difference in visual acuity)\nwas performed. The gratings on the UCB cards were more difficult to detect compared\nto the TAC on average by 0.08 logMAR; regression equation y = -0.105x -0.05, R2 =0.04.\nThe difference in acuity measures was relatively constant across the full range of\nacuities from 20/18 to 20/250.\nConclusion: The UCB cards yielded a more reduced acuity (0.08 log MAR on average) compared to\nthe Teller Acuity cards. Detection of the grating on the grey background on the TAC\nmay have been facilitated by an edge effect or contrast difference from the background,\nwhereas the UCB cards require a forced choice decision between the grating and the\nequiluminant grey field from the background. It is important to recognize that grating\nacuities underestimate vision loss compared with Snellen acuity.","title":"Visual acuity Comparison of Teller Acuity Cards to the UC Berkeley Grating Cards","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185136\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California, Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Deborah Orel-Bixler\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California, Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Parents were instructed to encourage the use of spectacles\nfor the first month and then let the children decide for themselves for the following\ntwo months. Extend of spectacles wear (always / during near work / rarely / never)\nwas assessed after one and three months. The mandatory use of spectacles in\nthe first month followed by voluntary use suggests that extend of spectacles wear\nafter 3 months can be considered a reasonable method of assessing the children's relief\nwhen wearing spectacles.\nVisual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, amplitude of accommodation,\nnear point of convergence and frequency of asthenopic symptoms (Convergence Insufficiency\nSymptoms Survey score) were measured at the initial eye examination to identify possible\npredictors of acceptance/rejection of spectacle wear.

Because of the\nincreased use of electronic media by children, the purpose of this study is to explore\nthe characteristics of accommodative behavior in emmetropic and myopic children to\na variety of targets displayed on electronic devices. Does increased angular size\nassociated with close viewing generate accommodative lag? Does binocularity or room\nlighting help reduce lag?\nMethods: The study participants include emmetropic (-0.25D to +1.00D) and myopic children (-0.50\nD to -6.00 D) between 7 and 16 years of age with best corrected Snellen acuity of\n20/20 or better and without any binocular vision anomaly or ocular pathology.\nThe\nWAM-5500 open-field autorefractor (Grand Seiko) was used in dynamic mode to assess\nthe refractive state of these children 5 times per second. High contrast text and\nchildren's movies were viewed either monocularly or binocularly with room light on\n(133 cd/m2) or off (< 25 cd/m2).

This is an extremely rare, nonhereditary\ncongenital anomaly, which is frequently associated with other ocular or systemic conditions.\nThis report describes a 2 month old infant that presented to clinic for evaluation\ndue to asymmetry of the two eyes. The affected eye's corneal diameter measured 6 mm,\nwhile the unaffected eye's corneal diameter measured 11 mm. The child was blink to\nlight in the unaffected eye and had no blink to light response in the affected eye.\nThe child had a relative afferent pupillary defect in the affected eye. Cycloplegic\nrefraction revealed age-appropriate compound hyperopic astigmatism in each eye. Fundus\nexamination revealed absence of the optic nerve, the optic disc and retinal vasculature\nin the affected eye. The unaffected eye's fundus exam was within normal limits. The\nchild is meeting developmental milestones appropriately at this time. Concern for\ncentral nervous system anomalies is low in patients with unilateral ONA, however,\nMRI of the brain and orbits still must be utilized to rule this out. Retcam is useful\nin documenting retinal abnormalities in infants and young children. B-scan can be\nutilized in-office to detect the presence or absence of the optic nerve as well as\ndetermining a gross axial length of the eye when microphthalmia is suspected. While\nMRI is a valuable tool in ruling out associated central nervous system anomalies,\nit is not necessary for diagnosis. MRI of the brain and orbits with and without contrast\nof this patient is pending.\nConclusion: Thorough ophthalmic examination and utilization of ancillary testing is necessary\nin making the diagnosis of ONA. Management of these cases is primarily geared towards\nparental education as the child will need full-time protective eyewear beginning when\nthe child is mobile, future need for possible oculoplastic surgery, future need for\npossible prosthesis as well as long-term implications of being monocular.

Independent replicate examination for quality assurance\nwas carried out in four schools using 5% of the sample size to validate the data collected.\nData were analyzed using IBM SPSS 20 and EPI info 3.4.5.\nResults: A total of 2148 children were selected and 2110 (87%) were examined. The prevalence\nof uncorrected, presenting and best corrected visual acuity of 0.3 (20/40) or worse\nin the better eye was 8.1%, 8.0%, and 0.19% respectively. Refractive error was the\ncause in (70.4%; 63.5 , 76) of 171 eyes with reduced vision, amblyopia 6 (3.0%; 1.1\n, 6.4), corneal opacity 3(1.5%; 0.3 , 4.3) cataract and retinal anomaly had 1(0.5%;\n0.0 ,2.8) each, others which include cases of phthisis bulbi was 2(1.1%; 0.3 ,4.3).The\nmajor and independent predictors for visual impairment were age (AOR 1.97, 95% CI\n1.45, 2.67) high socioeconomic status (AOR 1.68, 95% CI 1.36, 2.09) and female gender\n(AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.00,1.88).\nConclusion: Nearly 50% of the causes of visual impairment are avoidable, most of it because of\nuncorrected refractive error, which is a reflection of inadequate refractive error\nservices in the area. We, therefore, recommend routine comprehensive school health\nprogramme that has eye care integrated.","title":"Prevalence of Visual Impairment and Determinants Among SchoolAge Children in Southern  Nigeria","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185127\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Calabar\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kovin Naidoo, Nelson Osuchukwu, Antor Ndep, Ekanem Ekanem\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Brien Holden Vision Institute, University of Calabar, University of Calabar, University of Lagos\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The Program aimed to:\na) increase\noptometrists' knowledge and skills in paediatric eye care, thus building capacity\nfor community based care;\nb) build inter-professional relationships and clinical\ncommunication pathways between optometry and the specialist paediatric eye clinic;\nand\nc) improve access to eye care, both access to tertiary care, through improved\ntertiary hospital demand management, and access to optometric eye care closer to home.\nAIMS:\nEvaluate whether the model of integrated care service delivery can improve access\nto specialist paediatric eye care while maintaining satisfaction of the patients and\nfamilies involved in the Program.\nExplore the nature of the inter-professional\nrelationship between tertiary hospital eye clinic professionals and community optometrists\ncaring for children before and after introduction of the collaborative care program.\nMethods: Qualitative assessment of practitioner attitude and understanding of integrated care\ndelivery was determined at the outset of the program by focus group interviews (March\n2016), and reviewed by an on-line survey (n=97; response rate 46% n=45) in January\n2018. Family's satisfaction with post-discharge care was surveyed in a purposive sample\nof 30 patients. Change in tertiary service access was determined from the change in\nnumber of new patients yet to be scheduled clinic appointment from January 2016, prior\nto commencement of the alignment program, to November 2017.\nResults: 97 optometrists from across Queensland completed paediatric eye care education and\nagreed to collaborative care protocols to align in the Program. By November 2017,\n320 children had been discharged to the network for their future eye care. The percentage\nof children waiting longer than clinically recommended time fell from 72% in January\n2016 to 36% by the end of November 2017. 67% of surveyed families had attended a community\noptometrist and rated their experience from good to excellent.

Telemedicine may offer improved access to pediatric eye care\nfor children in underserved areas, while providing educational support for allied\nhealth care professionals.\nMethods: This prospective, non-inferiority study evaluated the safety and accuracy of using\ntelemedicine equipment - Polycom codecs, Pivothead glasses, digital slit lamp, and\ndigital indirect ophthalmoscope - for diagnosing and managing pediatric eye conditions\nin a collaborative care setting. Subjects were drawn either from new referrals to\nthe ophthalmology clinic or from the optometrist's referrals from her own practice;\neligibility criteria required subjects be able to participate in an age-appropriate\nmanner. A pediatric optometrist worked the patient up in the clinic room, while a\npediatric ophthalmologist remotely viewed the examination in real time, and subsequently\nvalidated the results in person. Non-inferiority of telemedicine relative to the in-person\nexam was measured by whether or not there was change in diagnosis or management plan\nfollowing validation by the ophthalmologist. Patient, family, and provider satisfaction;\noptometric education; and the role of collaborative care were evaluated.\nResults: Two hundred and ten patients (ages 0-17 years, median age 6) and one parent or guardian\nper patient participated in the study. More than half of patients (61.4%) presented\nwith strabismus as a primary diagnosis. All patients were adequately examined via\ntelemedicine. When the ophthalmologist validated the exams in person, only one diagnosis\nwas changed (99.5% agreement) and no treatment plans were changed (100%). Furthermore,\n58.1% of patients were deemed appropriate to be seen in follow-up exclusively by the\noptometrist, 14.3% could be co-managed in the future via telemedicine, and the remaining\n27.6% required strabismus surgery.\nFifty percent of encounters resulted in\nknowledge gained by the optometrist, which occurred throughout the study. In 48% of\nthose cases, knowledge gained from collaborative care would change the optometrist's\nfuture management of similar patients, mainly recommending observation or trying alternate\nforms of treatment before referring for surgery.\nThe vast majority of families\nfelt comfortable with the quality of the telemedicine exam (99%), and indicated they\nwould participate in another telemedicine exam in the future (97%).\nConclusion: Telemedicine offers a feasible platform for delivering collaborative pediatric eye\ncare, in which optometry plays a vital role.","title":"Telemedicine for Pediatric Eye Care A Real World Approach to Collaborative Medicine","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185129\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Children's Hospital Los Angeles\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carly Stewart, Mark Reid, Thomas Lee, Sudha Nallasamy\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Children's Hospital Los Angeles\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Screening for hyperopia remains challenging, as children may exert sufficient\naccommodation to overcome hyperopia and pass screening tests. Variants of the plus\nlens test are used in screenings by optometrists and by lay screening personnel, however,\nthere has been limited assessment of its validity. The aim of this study was to investigate\nthe plus lens test's ability to detect hyperopia in schoolchildren.\nMethods: Participants included 61 Grade 2 schoolchildren (mean age: 7.2 yrs ± 0.4) without\nspectacle correction. Monocular visual acuity was measured through +1.50 lenses using\ncrowded logMAR charts. Non-cycloplegic retinoscopy and cycloplegic refraction were\nalso performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to\nassess the sensitivity and specificity of the plus lens test and non-cycloplegic retinoscopy\nin identifying hyperopia (cycloplegic refraction ?2D).\nResults: Thirteen (21.3%) of the children were classified as hyperopic (?2D). Sensitivity and\nspecificity of the plus lens test to detect children with hyperopia, using common\ncut-offs of 20/20 and 20/30 were 8% and 94%, and 46% and 85% respectively (area under\nthe ROC curve = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.57 - 0.87). The optimum cut-off for non-cycloplegic\nretinoscopy for detecting hyperopia (cycloplegic refraction ?2D) was >1.00D, with\nsensitivity and specificity of 84.6% and 93.7% respectively (area under the ROC curve\n= 0.94, 95% CI: 0.88 - 1.00).\nConclusion: The plus lens screening test is not effective for identifying hyperopia, which may\nbe due to a lack of time for adaptation; children with uncorrected hyperopia may need\ntime to relax their accommodation system through a plus lens - which is not ideal\nfor time-constrained screening programs. Non-cycloplegic retinoscopy is a more valid\nscreening test for identifying hyperopia; however, requires a higher level of training\nto perform accurately.","title":"Plus Lens Screening Test as a Predictor of Hyperopia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185130\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Queensland University of Technology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Alexander Black, Sonia White, Joanne Wood\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Queensland University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

A successful measurement was defined as by the app's ability to fit the border\nof the iris and the location of the corneal reflection. Positive strabismus measurements\nfrom EyeTurn were defined by a threshold calculated by clustering data into two classes..\nStudents who met criteria for a positive screen with this threshold were then re-evaluated\nwith prism cover-test. Specificity and sensitivity were calculated by comparing the\nnumber the students with strabismus as defined by either >8–³ exophoria or >6–³\nesophoria (recommended by AAPOS) by prism cover test to the 44 students with positive\nscreens for strabismus with the EyeTurn app measurement.\n\nResults: 123 (92.5%) children had at least 1 successful measurement; 66.0% had 2; 33.0% had\n3 for an image capture success rate of 85.0% (322/379). The median strabismus degree\nwas 2.78, the 25th and 75th percentile were 1.17 and 3.27 –³ separately. The cut-off\npoint was calculated as 3.30 –³. Specificity and sensitivity when using this threshold\nwere 84.0% (105/125) and 83.3% (5/6). There were 2 cases of intermittent strabismus\nand 3 cases of large phoria (presumably dissociated by the camera flash) identified\nby the app which were missed by the conventional screening. The most common issue\nreported by the nurse was sensitivity to the flash resulting in eye closing and app\nmeasurement failure. Overall the nurse reported her experience using the app as positive\nand intuitive.\nConclusion: It is feasible for a school nurse to use Eyeturn during routine screening as demonstrated\nby the ability to obtain at least 1 suitable image in 92.5% of children. Eyeturn may\noffer improved screening capabilities as demonstrated by the app's ability to detect\ncases of strabismus that were missed during conventional screening. Further improvements\nto address sensitivity to flash and improve user interface are currently underway.","title":"The EyeTurn App for School Vision Screening","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185132\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research I...\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Marissa Lynn, Cong Shi, Matteo Tomasi, Shrinivas Pundlik, Gang Luo, Kevin Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research I..., Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research I..., Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research I..., Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research I..., Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research I..., Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research I...\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The population served is 92.5% African-American\nor Hispanic. From right eye cycloplegic results, 2352 of 30,303 patient (7.8%) have\nastigmatism ?2.50 diopters (max. 8.50 D). Last year, an Oculus topographer was added\nto the clinic for corneal mapping in order to help identify early indicators of keratoconus.\nIt is the goal of the clinic to provide patients all eyecare needed to ensure good\nvision and eye health.\nPurpose: Keratoconus often begins in puberty and occurs\nin 50-200 per 100,000 people (1). The literature states it is more prevalent in African-American\nand Hispanic races (2). The purpose of this study is to obtain topography scans on\neach patient. The scans are read by masked experts who then determine patients' risk\nand/or diagnosis of keratoconus. Patients found to be at risk for the disease will\nthen be contacted and receive further diagnostic and appropriate treatments (contact\nlens fits, cross-linking).\nMethods:\nMethods: It was decided to review the first 3 months of data for this presentation.\nTopography maps were collected from the first 325 patients (ages 5-17; 178 females,\n147 males) tested with the goal of ensuring the protocol was adequate for accurate\ndata collection. The topographer has not historically been used on children this young\nand we needed to demonstrate it was possible to gather good data from this select\ngroup. The recommendations from the scan reviewers suggested the total deviation (final\nD) and the ART-max (thinnest pachymetry/pachymetry progression index) be analyzed.\nA final D value < 1.61 and an ARTmax of <380 determine a patient\nas keratoconic suspect. Amongst other factors including repeatability, these two numbers\nare used as the criteria for the study and are the most reliable indicators in diagnosing\nthe disease.\nResults:\nResults: In the initial 3 months of the study, topography was completed on 325 subjects\nof which 309 (615 eyes) were readable. Using the guidelines of a final D < 1.61\nand ARTmax <380, 254 eyes, slightly over one-third, are keratoconus suspects. The\nearly limited viable scans may have been influenced by erroneous factors such as fixation,\nblinking, or lid position (16 excluded) as there was an initial learning curve. While\nthese results may be higher than average, they support the prevalence in our high\nrisk population.\nConclusion:\nConclusion: It is evident there is a high number of keratoconus suspicion in our patients.\nThis pilot study shows it is possible and important to perform topography as part\nof pediatric eye exams. Our goal is to intervene prior to damage from keratoconus.\nThis will ensue our patients maintain vision and good ocular health as long as possible\nfor a brighter future. As scans are continued throughout the 3 year study, further\ndata will be presented.","title":"Suspicion of Keratoconus in Children at a Schoolbased Vision Clinic A Pilot Study  of an AtRisk Population","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185133\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Sandra Block\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dr.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Stanley Hatch","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/metaanalysis-of-eye-movements-between-subjects-with-and-without-dyslexia","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: It is frequently reported that readers with dyslexia take longer to read, lose their\nplace often, skip words or lines, miss their fixation target, and take in less information\nper fixation. Some argue these traits reflect the cognitive phonologic difficulties\npeople with dyslexia possess (symbol identification and language decoding leading\nto inefficient connection to oculomotor nuclei). Others argue an imbalance between\ncorridors of the visual pathway disrupts visual attention and visual memory prior\nto decoding. Studies conducted on eye movements during reading and tracking provide\nevidence supporting each argument. Most study samples sizes are small. The purpose\nof this study is to use the statistical method of meta-analysis to pool data from\nmultiple eye movement studies to achieve higher power.\nMethods: Search engines PubMed and Salus/Ebsco Total Search All Article Database with key words\n\"eye movements, saccades, dyslexia, reading disability\" yielded over 500 titles. Following\ninitial exclusion criteria, 37 studies qualified for in depth review. Data were extracted\nfrom qualifying studies for all objective eye movement variables and tested for homogeneity\nby Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data were standardized, weighted by sample size, and pooled.\nResults: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Pooled data revealed significant\ndifferences between cases and controls for fixation duration while reading words (p=0.05).\nNumber of fixations reading pseudowords differed but did not achieve statistical significance\n(p=0.07). No significant differences existed for fixation duration or regressions\nreading pseudowords. Variables from valid study designs that were unable to be pooled\nare reviewed systematically. Differences in eye movement control tend to occur when\ncognitive processes involve reading and decoding but not for tracking objects.\nConclusion: Comparison of reading eye movements in subjects with dyslexia to age expected controls\ndetected meaningful differences in fixation duration under reading conditions. Systematic\nreview of other eye movement variables also revealed significant differences under\nreading conditions though a minority of studies failed to find differences. The opposite\nwas true for tracking objects. Only a minority of studies detected differences between\nsubjects with dyslexia and age expected controls with the majority of studies reporting\nno differences. These data support the view that most differences in eye movements\noccur after visual inputs connect to brain centers involved in symbol recognition\nand decoding rather than purely from neuro processing in the visual pathway.","title":"MetaAnalysis of Eye Movements Between Subjects With and Without Dyslexia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185134\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

If these claims were validated empirically, it might be clinically beneficial\nfor children with DD who report these symptoms to receive a comprehensive eye exam\nwith detailed evaluation of their sensorimotor function.\nPurpose:\nThe\nprimary aim of the present study was to document self-reported vision-related symptoms\nin children with developmental dyslexia and typically reading (TR) peers. We also\nexplored whether vision symptoms were correlated with sensorimotor measures of vergence,\naccommodation and ocular motor tracking skills.\nMethods: Using a prospective group comparison observational design, we assessed 28 children\nwith DD and 33 TR children 7- 11 years of age at Boston Children's Hospital. Participants\ncompleted psychoeducational testing (IQ, single word reading and spelling), a comprehensive\nsensorimotor eye examination (vergence : amplitude, range and facility; accommodation:\namplitude, facility and accuracy) and ocular motor tracking: developmental eye movement\ntest and Visagraph (infrared limbal eye tracker), and the Convergence Insufficiency\nSymptom Survey (CISS). The CISS includes 9 items pertaining to vision-related symptoms\n(CISS-V) which were the primary focus of analysis.\nResults: CISS-V score was significantly higher for DD (4.89 ±3.97) than TR (0.97 ± 1.36) children,\nafter adjusting for effects of age and gender (p < 0.001). The most common vision-related\nsymptoms, reported by nearly one-third of the DD children, were tired eyes, words\nblurring in and out and double vision during reading (differences from TR all p<0.01).\nThe largest correlations (r~ 0.4 to 0.5) were observed between CISS-V and Visagraph\neye tracker parameters - fixations and regressions- calculated for the groups combined\nas well as within the DD group.\nConclusion: This correlational study design does not imply that the visual symptoms play a causal\nrole in dyslexia. However, assessing vision-related symptom surveys in children with\ndyslexia may be clinically relevant, since a comprehensive eye examination with detailed\nevaluation of sensorimotor functioning could benefit those who report higher levels\nof symptoms.","title":"SelfReported Visual Symptoms in Children with Developmental Dyslexia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185135\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Harvard Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        David Hunter, Sowjanya Gowrisankaran, Deborah Waber\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

{"_type":"dict","author":"Adam Peiffer","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/the-developmental-eye-movement-test-as-an-assessment-of-visualverbal-processing-in-acute-adolescent-concussion","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: The Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) Test is often used to assess the function of\nthe oculomotor system and has been previously been shown to have utility in this area.\nThe DEM has not been used as frequently in concussion evaluation compared to the King-Devick.\nThe DEM is unique in the ability to distinguish automaticity (visual-verbal processing)\nfrom oculomotor deficits. Controversy surrounds the ability of visual-verbal processing\ntasks to adequately measure all components of saccadic eye movement skills. The task\nmay be related more closely to reading performance and visual processing speed. Therefore,\nthe ability to differentiate oculomotor dysfunction and automaticity, especially in\nconcussion, may be important to determine the best course of management. The objective\nof this study was to determine if the DEM provides useful data regarding oculomotor\nfunction as a screening tool in acute adolescent sports-related concussion evaluation.\nMethods: 53 subjects (34 concussion, 19 controls) aged 9 to 17 were enrolled as part of the\nCANVAS Concussion Study. All subjects completed the DEM as part of a sensorimotor\nevaluation. Subjects were separated into those who had suffered a concussion <\n30 days prior and those who had never suffered a concussion. Raw scores were converted\nto age-matched standard scores and failure for each component was determined if the\nscore was 1 SD (15) below the median (100) for the established age-matched normative\ndatabase. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the major outcome measures.\nResults: In the group with concussion, the mean time since injury was 9.5 (± 6.5) days. Automaticity\ndisorder was diagnosed in 18% (95% CI = 5%, 31%) of concussions and 5% (95% CI = -5%,\n15%) of controls. Within the concussion group 29% (95% CI = 26%, 32%) failed the horizontal\ncomponent, of which 60% (95% CI = 30%, 90%) failed both the vertical and horizontal\ncomponents while 40% (95% CI = 10%, 70%) passed the vertical and failed the horizontal.\nOf all those with an automaticity disorder, 86% (95% CI = 60%, 112%) were those who\nsuffered a recent concussion.\nConclusion: Failures on both the vertical and horizontal components of this visual-verbal processing\ntask are more common than isolated horizontal component failures. This suggests that\nautomaticity disorders are more prevalent than a true oculomotor dysfunction following\na concussion. Automaticity disorders are also more common in the acutely concussed\nthan non-concussed adolescents. The DEM may serve as a useful tool in the assessment\nof functional deficits after concussion, as it evaluates both automaticity and oculomotor\nfunction. Incorporation of this test in concussion evaluation protocols may guide\na more targeted treatment plan and appropriate academic accommodations.","title":"The Developmental Eye Movement Test as an Assessment of VisualVerbal Processing in  Acute Adolescent Concussion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185119\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Hartwick, G.

Despite what appeared\nto be a visually devastating scar, with patching treatment the patient's vision improved\nsignificantly.\n\nCase Report: Patient ZR, a 4 year, 11 month old Hispanic female reported to clinic on 01/18/18\nfor a comprehensive eye exam. Upon examination, her best corrected vision was OD:\n20/125, OS: 20/20. She had no strabismus on cover testing. The patient demonstrated\nno stereoacuity and suppressed the right eye on Worth4Dot testing. Cycloplegic retinoscopy\nwas OD: +1.00DS, OS: -0.25+2.00x090. Ocular health examination was unremarkable except\nfor the presence of a large macular scar of the right eye. As a result of her decreased\nvision, a glasses prescription was given for full time wear for protection. In addition,\npatching of the left eye for two hours per day was initiated. The patient was scheduled\nto return to clinic in two months to monitor vision and treatment compliance.\nZR\nreturned to clinic on 03/14/18. Her mother reported compliance with treatment, and\nvision had improved to OD: 20/50-1, OS: 20/20. In addition, she was now able to appreciate\nthe stereo Fly. Otherwise, her examination was stable. After discussion with ZR's\nmother regarding visual development period and amblyopia treatment options, patching\nwas increased to six hours per day per mom's request.\nZR returned to clinic on\n04/26/18, reporting good compliance with patching seven hours per day. Her vision\nhad continued to improve (OD: 20/40, OS: 20/20). In addition, her stereoacuity had\nimproved, and she was able to identify 3/3 animals and appreciated the stereo Fly.\nWe encouraged the patient to continue with a minimum of six hours per day patching\ndue to her continued improvement in vision. She is to return to clinic in 6 weeks.\nConclusion: Eccentric fixation can be an advantageous adaptation of the visual system to optimize\nvisual acuity.

Her surgical history was remarkable for three esotropia surgeries, all performed\nunder the age of ten. She manifested a constant, comitant, alternating exotropia greater\nthan 45 prism diopters. She was very bothered by the appearance of her ocular posture\nand was interested in any remediation. Correspondence testing with Synptophore, Worth\n4 Dot, and red lens indicated paradoxical anomalous correspondence (PAC Type I), wherein\nher cortical system responded as though her eyes were esotropic, despite her exotropic\nposture. Given the magnitude of her deviation and cosmetic concern, a modified and\nstructured vision therapy regimen was proposed. Motor stimulation and monocular activities\nwere incorporated into a weekly supervised in-office vision therapy, supplemented\nby home therapy activities. No vision therapy was directed towards breaking her PAC\nadaptation or engaging any sensory fusion which may have led to intractable diplopia.\nAfter 6 weeks, she has achieved improved cosmetic alignment, and can motorically align\nherself with effort. Her vision therapy is on-going, in order to provide a stronger\nmotor foundation, before graduating her from in-office training.\nConclusion: Current literature suggests that anomalous correspondence patients, having adapted\nto their strabismic angle, lack the normal sensorimotor fusional potential to be good\ncandidates for vision therapy. This case suggests that a structured and modified vision\ntherapy regimen designed to maximize motor fusional ranges for a large angle exotrope\ncan lead to cosmetic success for the patient.","title":"When The Eyes Are Out But the Brain is In A Case of Paradoxical Anomalous Correspondence  and Strabismus Vision Therapy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185121\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Symptoms started a few weeks prior and occurred in\nboth eyes. No other eye or vision complaints reported. CR's birth and developmental\nhistory, his family's medical and ocular history were unremarkable. Although CR was\ndoing well in school, he was moved to the front of the classroom due to his vision\ncomplaints.\nCR's entering acuities uncorrected were 20/50 OD and 20/40 OS at distance\nand near. Pertinent exam findings included negative stereopsis and normal color vision\nwith HRR Pseudoisochromatic Test. A large refractive error was found OD: +5.50-0.50x180\nand OS: +5.00-1.25x180. A glasses prescription was released and education was given\non the effects of uncorrected refractive error. Close follow up care was stressed.\nCR's\nfirst follow up reported improvement with day and night vision with the prescribed\nglasses. Acuities of 20/40+2 were recorded OD/OS at distance and 20/25 OD/OS at near.\nSince improvement of vision and symptoms occurred but did not cease, we recommended\ncontinued monitoring and a return in 6 weeks. At that visit, CR's mother reported\nno additional improvement in symptoms. Refractive error and visual acuities were stable.\nDue to improving but continuing complaint of night blindness, CR was referred for\nvisual electrodiagnostic testing (VET).\nVET showed subnormal ERGs and abnormal\nlesions surrounding the macula illuminated by fluorescein autofluorescence. CR's VEP\nshowed normal amplitudes but delayed latency OD and borderline latency OS. Due to\nthe abnormal findings, differential diagnoses were Congenital Stationary Night Blindness,\nan early variant of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), Enhanced S-cone Syndrome (ESCS), or\nFundus Albipunctatus. Referral to the low vision department was made for an evaluation\nand genetic testing.\nSince CR only had mildly reduced visual acuity, low vision\nmagnification devices were not appreciated at this time. A NoIR 58 65% yellow filter\nhelped with CR's slight contrast impairment. A personal flashlight was also recommended\nfor night mobility. Genetic testing was ordered and CR showed a homozygous mutation\nfor the NR2E3 gene. This variant has been reported to be causative for autosomal recessive\nESCS and RP.\nReviewing the exam findings, VETs , and the genetic results, a diagnosis\nof Retinitis Punctata Albescens (RPA), a subtype of RP, was given.\nConclusion: Without the utilization of genetic testing and VETs, a definitive diagnosis for this\npatient would have been difficult. Knowing the diagnosis and prognosis allows for\nan appropriate management and rehabilitation plan. This poster will discuss the presentation,\nocular findings, diagnostic criteria, management options, interdisciplinary management\nand prognosis of RPA.","title":"NR2E3 Gene Aids Diagnosis of Pediatric Night Blindness","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185122\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Stephanie Schmiedecke- Barbieri, Nancy Sorrell\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Rosenberg School of Optometry, Rosenberg School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Demodex is the most\ncommon ectoparasite on humans. There are two common types\"”D. folliculorum and\nD. brevis\"”the former infesting the eyelashes and causing anterior blepharitis\nand the latter infesting the meibomian glands and causing posterior blepharitis. Clinical\npresentation includes chronic blepharitis, conjunctival inflammation, meibomian gland\ndysfunction, pyogenic granulomas, chalazion (recurrent), cylindrical dandruff, and\ngeneral unresponsiveness to conventional blepharitis treatment. While the treatment\nhas been well documented in adults, it has not been well described in the pediatric\npopulation.\nCase Report: Case 1: An 11-year-old female presented complaining of bumps on her eyelids for the\npast two months. Patient denied any itchiness. The patient was found to have capped\nmeibomian glands and three pyogenic granulomas. Patient was prescribed 0.1% FML suspension\nand educated on lid hygiene. Over the following four months, the patient was compliant\nwith treatment but the signs never resolved completely. After being lost to follow-up\nfor a year, the patient returned with new pyogenic granulomas and chalazia. After\nre-initiating treatment and a one month follow up with no improvement, patient was\nreferred to the oculoplastics clinic. The patient was diagnosed with underlying demodex\ngiven the symptoms of recurrent pyogenic granulomas and chalazia (likely of the D.\nbrevis species). In-office tea tree oil treatment was applied without complications\nand good tolerance. Patient was educated on proper hygiene (cleaning all towels, linens,\netc.) and is due for a one month follow-up.\nCase 2: A 9-year-old female presented\nwith complaints of blurry vision and itchy eyes. Patient had no known allergies, and\nsymptoms of itchiness were not specific to the change in seasons. Patient had a history\nof head lice three months prior. Upon examination, patient was found to have collarettes\nat the base of the lashes with cylindrical casings along the lashes. Patient was diagnosed\nwith demodex, likely being the D. folliculorum species, given the symptoms\nof itchiness only and the meibomian glands being unaffected. Patient was educated\non proper hygiene and was referred to the oculoplastics department for an in-office\ntea tree oil treatment.\n\nConclusion: Eye care providers play a crucial role in the path to diagnosis of pediatric diseases,\nincluding anterior segment diseases. Eye care providers should recognize the signs\nand symptoms of demodex and not overlook it as a differential diagnosis. It is easy\nto overlook especially when demodex is more prevalent and better described in the\nolder population (although pediatric prevalence may be low due to under-diagnosis).\nPrompt tea tree oil treatment is necessary, as it is effective and well tolerated\nin this population.","title":"Recognizing and Treating Demodex in Pediatric Patients with Different Symptoms","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185123\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY State College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Harriette Canellos\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

To our knowledge, there\nare no documented cases of filamentary keratitis secondary to floppy eyelid syndrome\nin this patient population. Filamentary keratitis should be ruled out in symptomatic\npatients, and its presence should prompt further evaluation of the eyelids for floppy\neyelid syndrome and associated systemic and ophthalmic conditions.","title":"Case Report Filamentary Keratitis in a Pediatric Patient with Floppy Eyelid Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185124\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Hunter Morgan, Alanna Khattar, Nathan Nataneli\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

He was referred\nby his pediatrician for torticollis. His mother also had some concerns regarding his\nvision as he did not seem to focus. The patient was born full term without complications\nincluding passing his hearing screening at birth. He had been receiving therapy over\nthe past month secondary to keeping his head to the left and some associated limitations\nwith movement. Per his last well child exam, the patient was unable to move his neck\nand head a full 180 degrees with restriction of neck movements towards the right.\nFamily history was unremarkable except for a half-brother with severe developmental\ndelays and a maternal aunt with history of strabismus.\nExamination revealed mostly\nsporadic but smooth eye movements with a tendency to hold his eyes in a side gaze\nto his left. He demonstrated a searching nystagmus with no fixation and follow as\nwell as no tracking past the midline. Vision was not central, steady or maintained.\nEyes appeared aligned based off hirschberg reflexes, but the patient demonstrated\na severe head tilt to the left with facial asymmetry. Cycloplegic examination was\nage appropriate, and pupils were equal, round and reactive to light. All other anterior\nand posterior examination findings were normal including C/D ratios of 0.2 with pink\nand distinct optic nerve heads. Noting no ocular cause of the torticollis as well\nas developmentally delayed eye movements, the patient was referred for an MRI without\ncontrast. The test revealed large areas of cystic encephalomalacia of the left frontoparietal\nand superior left temporal lobes. He was diagnosed with a central nervous system disorder\ncausing right hypertonia.\n\nConclusion: The literature shows that neonatal hypertonia is far less common than hypotonia. In\nfact, hypertonia from birth is rare and central in origin as in this case. It is important\nfor providers performing infant eye examinations to know a time line for normal visual\ndevelopment as well as causes of ocular torticollis. Increased tone in an upper extremity\nalong with poor eye movements, even at an early age, can be indicative of an underlying\ncentral nervous system disorder. While this is typically picked up by a pediatrician\neye professionals need to be aware this could come in to their clinic.","title":"Central Nervous System Disorder Identified on an Infant Eye Examination","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185125\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The CT assumes that the direction\nand amount of movement under the cover is equal in the two eyes and its accuracy is\nsubjectively determined by the examiner. This study addressed three research questions:\n(1) the agreement between the clinical CT and the CT performed with an eye tracker\n(ET) (2) do the right and left eyes behave similarly under the cover? (3) is the movement\nunder the cover is related to the cover duration.\nMethods: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and college students\n(N=30, 11 male) between the ages of 21-28 (mean age: 24.5± 2.22) with a mean VA of\n-0.03 ± 0.04 (logMAR) and with 20\" stereopsis were enrolled after signing an informed consent. ET CT (SMI Red250 Infra\nRed (IR) tracker) was performed using an IR filter placed by the examiners in front\nof the tested eye for either three or 10 seconds. The IR filter was synchronized with\nthe eye position recording to indicate the precise cover and uncover times. The order\nof testing was pseudorandom and included three measurements of alternating near penlight\nCT, followed by near ET CT, or vice versa. The CT and the ET CT results were compared\nusing a paired t-test, as well as correlation and Bland and Altman (B-A) analysis.\nResults: Mean clinical CT results were 4.27 ± 3.96\nÎ”\nexophoria (XP), and mean ET\nthree and 10 second results were 3.07 ± 3.30\nÎ”\nXP (right eye), 3.10 ± 3.05\nÎ”\nXP (left eye), and 2.80 ± 3.39\nÎ”\nXP (right eye) and 4.18 ± 3.80\nÎ”\nXP\n\n(left eye).

{"_type":"dict","author":"Justine Grier","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/do-cover-test-measurements-change-after-cycloplegic-dilation-in-children","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: When developing a treatment plan for strabismus, most pediatric eye doctors rely on\ncover test measurements before dilation, because cycloplegia is expected to considerably\nchange ocular alignment. Especially when considering surgery for a pediatric patient,\nobtaining accurate objective measurements is essential.\nA 2017 study by Sean Rivera,\nMD and his colleagues reported that alignment measurements in adults with manifest\nstrabismus did not significantly change after the instillation of tropicamide and\nphenylephrine. However, children possess greater accommodative amplitude than adults,\nand cyclopentolate, commonly used in children, has a greater inhibitory effect on\naccommodation. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to determine if cover test\nmeasurements significantly change after cycloplegic dilation in children.\nMethods: Patients aged 5 to 17 with a latent or manifest strabismus were recruited as they\npresented to the pediatric ophthalmology department for an eye examination at Tufts\nFloating Hospital for Children. Patients were excluded if eccentric viewing was suspected,\nif a dissociated vertical deviation was present, or if the best corrected visual acuity\nin either eye was worse than 20/50 at distance or near. A protocol of cover test measurements\nwas completed at distance and near by the author, and repeated after cycloplegic dilation\nby the attending provider. A difference of six or more prism diopters was considered\nsignificant.\nResults: Between January and June 2018, 17 subjects were recruited. The average difference\nbetween pre- and post-dilated measurements at near was 6.2\nÎ”\nwhen the subject\nwas wearing his or her habitual correction and 5.2\nÎ”\nwhen measured with\nhis or her updated prescription placed in a trial frame. On average, dilated subjects\nbecame 4.8\nÎ”\nmore esophoric or esotropic at near, but their vergence posture\nat distance did not significantly change.\nInterestingly, as the refractive error\nbecame more positive (hyperopic), the post-dilation measurement was more likely to\nchange. Specifically, for every diopter increase toward hyperopia, the change between\npre- and post-dilated near measurement increased by a factor of 1.30 (p=0.006). Contrary\nto one of our hypotheses, there was no significant correlation between AC/A ratio\nand difference between pre- and post-dilated measurements at near (p=0.22).\nConclusion: In our sample of 17 pediatric patients, near cover test measurements significantly\nchanged after cycloplegic dilation, when measured in their habitual correction. This\nvariability was more prominent in hyperopic patients. Our data suggests that, in the\nsetting of teaching hospitals and clinics with interns, the attending eye care provider\nshould evaluate ocular alignment at near prior to dilation.","title":"Do Cover Test Measurements Change After Cycloplegic Dilation in Children","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185112\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New England College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Vicki Chen, Nicole Quinn, Catherine Choi\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Tufts Medical Center, New England College of Optometry, Tufts Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

More recently, increased screen time has also been\na growing concern in the pediatric population. A survey was distributed to the New\nEngland College of Optometry's graduate students to examine the relationship between\nscreen time and visual symptoms as a pilot study.\nMethods: A new web-based 15-item survey was used to evaluate the relationship between visual\nsymptoms and screen time in graduate-level optometry students using modified questions\nfrom the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey and the Ocular Surface Disease Index.\nThe survey was distributed via Google Forms in an email to students, and participants\nwere given seven days to access and complete the survey anonymously. The survey inquired\nabout binocular vision and dry eye symptoms, as well as the average number of hours\nper day an electronic screen was used (including, but not limited to tablets, smart\nphones, computers/laptops). The survey was scored out of 48 points. Self-reported\nhistory of strabismus, amblyopia, ocular pathology, structural ocular abnormalities,\nor best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/25 excluded the participant from completing\nthe survey.\nResults: Sixty-five optometry students aged 21-30 completed the survey (75% identified as female).\nThe most frequently reported total screen time interval was 6-8 hours/day, and most\nstudents reported 3-6 hours/day spent solely on handheld devices (i.e. phones or tablets).\nAverage symptom score (mean ± standard deviation) was 12.69 ± 7.9 for all subjects.\nThere was no correlation with total symptom score and number of hours per day spent\non screens. However, there was a trend that students who reported >12 hours/day\nhad lower symptoms scores (8 ± 6.16) compared to the symptom scores for students who\nspent less than 12 hours/day (13.26 ± 7.96).\nConclusion: Our 15-item survey did not find a significant difference in visual symptoms based\non reported daily screen time use. Students who reported the greatest amount of screen\ntime had lower symptomatology on the survey. This somewhat paradoxical finding may\nbe secondary to increased tolerance for extended screen time use by students who are\nmost visually comfortable, whereas students who are more symptomatic avoid excessive\nscreen exposure. Future work that further investigates which items of the survey are\nmost salient in detecting visual symptoms secondary to screen time use may help establish\nrecommended guidelines for use of such devices in both adults and children.","title":"Visual Symptoms and Screen Time in Graduate Students","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185114\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New England College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Emily Wiecek, Victoria Gagnon, Nicole Storey, Justine Grier, Stacy Lyons\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New England College of Optometry, New England College of Optometry, New England College of Optometry, New England College of Optometry, New England College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Cheng et\nal. (2010) demonstrated that prismatic bifocal spectacle lenses could reduce myopia\nprogression by 55% especially in low accommodation lag myopic children. However, there\nis no investigation examining whether the prolonged usage of prismatic bifocal spectacle\nlenses would affect the accommodative system.\nThis study is to investigate the\neffects of wearing prismatic bifocal spectacle lenses in the accommodative system\nin children.\n\nMethods: Nine subjects wearing prismatic bifocal lens ranged from 6 to 40 months were recruited\ninto the study.

We find that binocular responses\nare not improved over monocular responses with the Bassin Anticipation Timer (a device\nthat uses a track of sequentially illuminating lights to give the impression of an\nobject approaching in depth) except for some subjects at the highest velocity utilized\n(40mph).\nThe purpose of this study was to compare binocular and monocular CAT\nresponses on the Bassin Anticipation Timer over linear velocities of 5-40mph.\nMethods: CAT responses were assessed using a button press at five different velocities (5mph,\n10mph, 20mph, 30mph, and 40mph) on the Bassin Anticipation Timer. Each subject was\ntested under 3 randomized viewing conditions (about 50 trials per condition). The\nconditions were binocular viewing (B), monocular viewing with the dominant eye (MD),\nand monocular viewing with the non-dominant eye (MND). Subjects stood adjacent to\nthe last illuminated light.\nResults: Data were analyzed for 20 subjects. Signed and unsigned (absolute) CAT errors were\ncalculated. In all conditions, the mean signed errors were similar and followed the\nsame trend. Early responses were seen at lower velocities (5mph: B condition = 112\n± 94ms, MD = 117 ± 107ms, MND = 107 ± 85ms) and late responses were seen at higher\nvelocities (40mph: B condition = 62 ± 37ms, MD = 72 ± 38ms, MND = 76 ± 35ms). Mean\nunsigned errors were also similar and followed the same trend across conditions. The\nlargest unsigned errors were seen at lower velocities with the minimum unsigned errors\noccurring at 30mph (5mph: B condition = 125 ± 82ms, MD = 129 ± 95ms, MND = 120 ± 78ms;40mph:\nB condition = 63 ± 36ms, MD = 72 ± 38ms, MND = 77 ± 35ms). A three way ANOVA (factors:\nsubject, condition, target velocity) was performed and revealed significant higher\norder interactions suggesting variability between subjects. Therefore, to compare\nbinocular and monocular CAT responses, the signed and unsigned errors for each subject\nat each velocity were ranked by condition from 1 to 3 (1 was the most negative value\nfor signed errors, and the smallest value for unsigned errors). Only at 40mph did\na preponderance of subjects (12) demonstrate better performance for both signed and\nunsigned errors in the binocular condition.\nConclusion: Overall, these results suggest that when apparent motion occurs in real depth, binocular\nand monocular viewing results in similar coincidence-anticipation timing responses.\nFor some subjects, binocular viewing may provide advantages in CAT performance at\nvery high linear velocities.","title":"CoincidenceAnticipation Timing with Binocular and Monocular Viewing","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185107\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nicklaus Fogt\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

It is unclear how the degree of\nparalysis is related to covert attentional function because the prior studies did\nnot record eye movements. Thus, the goal of the current investigation was to compare\nboth covert and overt attentional performance in visually-normal and strabismic individuals\nto resolve this ambiguity.\nMethods: Ten visually-normal participants and five patients with paralytic strabismus participated\nin both overt and covert versions of an attentional cueing task. In both versions,\nparticipants viewed monocularly with their right eye and fixated a central circle\nuntil a square target appeared in the temporal or nasal hemi-field. On a proportion\nof trials, a small circular cue flashed prior to the target and was located in the\nsame or opposite hemi-field as the target. In the overt version, participants executed\na saccadic eye movement towards the target, whereas in the covert version, each was\ninstructed to maintain fixation and to indicate the target location with a numeric\nkeypad. Monocular eye movements were recorded with the Eyelink 1000 during both tasks.\nPatients viewed with either their sound or affected eye; however, only the eye movements\nof the sound eye were recorded. Statistical analyses were designed to compare the\nsame vs. opposite response latencies between both versions and groups.\nResults: The mean response latencies of visually-normal individuals in the same and opposite\nside conditions were significantly faster and slower, respectively, when compared\nto those in the control no-cue condition for both task versions [overt: -35.06 vs.\n25.07 ms, covert: -20.46 vs. 41.19 ms]. The mean response latencies of most patients\nfollowed a similar pattern and fell within the 95% CI established by the visually-normal\npopulation for all conditions in both tasks. An interesting exception was displayed\nby two patients who showed abnormally fast saccade latencies when cues appeared opposite\nto targets in the affected field [condition means: -14.63 and -4.88 ms].\nConclusion: Signatures of intact overt and covert attentional function were noted in all patients\nwith paralytic strabismus. Thus, dysfunction of motor nuclei does not necessarily\nlead to covert inattention in the corresponding region of visual space. Instead, the\nlack of opposite-side inhibition exhibited in two patients suggests a recalibration\nof attentional circuitry to favor the affected hemi-field. We propose the neural locus\nof this adaptation may be the superior colliculus, a midbrain structure known to play\na dynamic role in the allocation of spatial attention.","title":"Overt and Covert Visual Attention are Present in Paralytic Strabismics","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185108\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY State College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

In normal population, about 60% of them have the right eye as\nthe dominant eye and 30% of them have the left eye as the dominant eye. Among the\nremaining 10%, sighting dominance cannot be clearly classified (uncertain). In children\nwith intermittent exotropia (IXT), the percentage of patients with uncertain dominant\neye is much higher than that in normal population. Patients with IXT often show binocular\ndeficits since the deviated eye position disrupts the correlated binocular visual\ninputs. Therefore, we aimed to test if the altered distribution of ocular dominance\nis closely associated with the impaired binocular functions in patients with IXT.\nMethods: A total of 176 children aged between 4 to 13 years were recruited to the study. The\ninclusion criteria were: 1) intermittent exotropia since early childhood, 2) corrected\nvision in each eye equal to or better than 20/20, and 3) ability to alternate ocular\nfixation freely. A subject with any of the followings was excluded from the study:\n1) constant strabismus or other type of strabismus, 2) incomitance in horizontal and\nvertical deviation, 3) vertical deviation ? 5pd, 4) significant oblique muscle reaction,\n5) interocular difference of refractive error ?1D, 6) eye diseases or neurological\ndiseases except strabismus, and 7) history of ocular surgery. Sighting ocular dominance\nwas assessed by the hole-in-card test. The angular deviation was evaluated with alternate\ncover testing using prism. Fusional convergence and divergence amplitudes were measured\nwith a synoptophore. Stereoacuity was assessed with the Titmus stereo test. The binocular\nfunction was classified into four levels: no fusion, having fusion but without stereopsis,\nstereoacuity worse than 140 arcsec, and stereoacuity finer than 140 arcsec. All examinations\nwere performed after correction for refractive errors.\nResults: For IXT children with stereopsis finer than 140 arcsec (n=78), sighting ocular dominance\ndistribution did not deviate from the 6-3-1 ratio(p > 0.05). In children whose stereoacuity\nwas worse than 140 seconds arc (n=36), the percentage of IXT children who have uncertain\nocular dominance increased to 25% (p<0.05). In children who did not have stereopsis\n(n=36) or who did not have binocular fusion (n=26), the distribution of sighting ocular\ndominance deteriorates into chance distribution, in which right dominant, left dominant,\nand uncertain dominance took 1/3 of the population. This distribution significantly\ndeviated from the 6-3-1 ratio seen in normal population.\nConclusion: The distribution of sighting ocular dominance in children with IXT deviates from the\n6-3-1 ratio found in normal population and is associated with the level of sensory\nbinocular vision.","title":"Sighting Ocular Dominance and Stereopsis in Children with Intermittent Exotropia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185109\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Affiliated Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Hua Bi, Yanxu Chen, Zhijun Chen, Bin Zhang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry, Affiliated Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Affiliated Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

They read continuous text for 40 mins while wearing\nflicker glasses that was open in one session and alternated at 4 - 7 Hz in the other.\nSpacing between letters was reduced 30% in one of the two sessions to reduce text\ndisparity cues. Initial and ending fixation disparity and eye movement efficiency\nwas assessed during that time.\nResults: Fixation duration was shorter (- 86 ms, p < .0001), saccade amplitude greater (+\n.53 deg, p < .0001) and peak velocity higher (+ 3.86 deg/sec) while reading with\nalternate occlusion and good comprehension; opposite effects were observed with condensed\nspacing (Fixation duration: +65 ms, p < .0001; saccade amplitude: -.15, p = .015).\nBoth initial (uncrossed: - 5.78 arcmin, p < .0001; crossed: - 3.30 arcmin, p <\n.0001) and ending (uncrossed: - .94 arcmin, p = .026; crossed: - 3.23 arcmin, p <\n.0001) fixation disparity during reading was reduced with alternate occlusion, but\nsuch effects were significantly hampered or reserved by condensed letter spacing (initial\nuncrossed: + 2.14 arcmin, p = .002; initial crossed: - .68 arcmin, p = .142; ending\nuncrossed: +1.34 arcmin, p = .010; ending crossed: - 0.66 arcmin, p = .158).\nConclusion: Alternate occlusion likely facilitates the use of positional and disparity cues to\nimprove the planning of disconjugate eye movements as well as fusional threshold,\nleading to improved initial ocular execution and final stable fixation disparity.\nThe reduction in fixation disparity enhances the efficiency of text processing, leading\nto improved conjugate eye movements. Condensed spacing degrades sensitivity to these\nvisual cues and diminishes such effects. Further research should investigate whether\nrepeated training sessions can sustain the reduced fixation disparity in reading and\nalleviate symptoms in children with binocular dysfunction.","title":"Effect of Alternate Occlusion on Fixation Disparity and Eye Movements in Reading Text  with Condensed Spacing for Children with Binocular Dysfunctions","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185110\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Xiaoqin Chen, Yanglin Jiang, Ellen Ringle\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Tianjin Eye Hospital, China, Tianjin Eye Hospital, China, Pacific University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

She was a high achieving student with a strong athletic\nperformance history, both of which had declined post mTBI. Her presenting symptoms\nincluded significant headaches, diplopia, and dizziness when engaging in sustained\nnear tasks. She also presented with visual discomfort with any head movement.

Central fusion disruption is an acquired deficiency in sensory\nfusion caused by intracranial insult or prolonged visual deprivation. This poster\ndescribes a successful case of management of central fusion disruption with partial\nocclusion.\n\nCase Report: MJ, a 45-year-old male referred to Binocular Vision Clinic for evaluation of constant\nbinocular diplopia for the past 23 years. MJ had been in a motor vehicle accident\nin 1995 that caused an open skull trauma and MJ was in a coma for 35 days. As a result\nhe suffered from right-sided hemiparesis and right-sided homonymous hemianopsia. Multiple\ncorrective-prism prescriptions have been attempted to eliminate his symptoms of constant\ndouble vision, but they were unsuccessful. He also had strabismus surgery in 1997\nto eliminate the diplopia without success, although details of the surgery were unknown.\nUpon\nexamination, MJ's BCVA was 20/25 OD, 20/20 OS, pupil testing revealed 1+ afferent\npupillary defect (APD), and extraocular muscles were full. Goldman visual field confirmed\nright-sided homonymous hemianopsia. Ocular health revealed 1+ diffuse pallor of optic\nnerve in the right eye consistent with the APD. These findings are consistent with\ntraumatic optic neuropathy.\nCover test in nine fields of gaze revealed non-comitant,\nconstant right exotropia and right hypotropia, which were largest in magnitude in\ndextroelevation. MJ had no measurable ptosis. MJ also had no stereopsis and reported\nconstant diplopia at all distances and lighting conditions with the Worth four light.\nUsing the major amblyoscope and corrective prism in free-space, MJ did not demonstrate\nsensory fusion. He reported the images were \"almost single\", but never fused. This\nis consistent with his symptomatic diplopia over the years that had never been eliminated.\nWe\ndiagnosed MJ with central fusion disruption secondary to traumatic brain injury. In\norder to eliminate his diplopia, we applied 20/400 Bangerter filter centrally over\nhis spectacles to partially occlude his right eye. MJ reported single vision for the\nfirst time, since his accident. In managing patients with central fusion disruption,\nthe least amount of occlusion possible must be prescribed to eliminate the double\nvision. Several options include a central (spot) occlusion, hemi occlusion, or full\nocclusion. The location of the occlusion may vary with the non-comitant deviation.\nPartial occlusion allows for light penetration and peripheral fusion, which improves\nmobility.\nConclusion: Central fusion disruption is a rare condition that results in acquired constant diplopia\ndue to the inability to fuse images, even with bifoveal alignment. Patients may be\nmismanaged with prism or strabismus surgery. Evaluating whether fusion is attainable\nis the key to the diagnosis. Patients are best managed with partial occlusion.","title":"Management of Central Fusion Disruption after Open Skull Trauma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185097\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Berkeley Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jennifer Fisher\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Berkeley Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This case examines a progressive esotropia in a patient with high axial\nmyopia.\n\nCase Report: A 53 year old African American male presented for a strabismus evaluation at the Illinois\nEye Institute. His left eye has been turning inward since childhood, but has been\nworsening over the past few months. He is HIV positive, but clinically healthy. He\nhas a history of retinal detachment OS. BCVAs in the distance are 20/60 OD and 20/300\nOS. He has an abduction defect and reduced elevation OD and OS, with a positive forced\nduction test. Pupils and fields are normal, and he has no stereoacuity. He has a >100pd\nconstant left esotropia, and 15-20 pd left hypotropia. His refraction is -20.00 DS\nOD and -21.00 DS OS. Anterior segment exam was normal OU. Posterior segment exam revealed\na myopic disc and fundus OU.\nThe patient was diagnosed with myopic strabismus\nfixus. Positive forced duction testing ruled out 6\nth\nnerve palsy, Duane's\nsyndrome, and acquired esotropia. Blood work was normal and thyroid eye disease was\nruled out. Myopic strabismus fixus is characterized by progressive esotropia, and\noften hypotropia, in the setting of high axial myopia. This occurs due to prolapse\nof the globe at the muscle cone superotemporally due to long axial length. MRI studies\nhave shown the superior rectus is displaced nasally and the lateral rectus is displaced\ninferiorly, which results in limited elevation and abduction. Management of this condition\nis surgical due to the progressive nature of the condition without treatment. Traditional\nmedial rectus recession/lateral rectus resection surgeries are ineffective due to\nthe unique pathophysiology of the condition. Loop myopexy is the surgery of choice\nbecause it corrects the abnormal muscle paths. In this procedure a silicone band is\nused to tether the superior and lateral rectus muscles together. This technique corrects\nup to 40 pd of the deviation. This surgery can be combined with a medial rectus recession\nfor larger deviations (up to 140 pd).\nFor this patient, the decision was\nmade to operate on the left eye only, due to the poor vision in that eye. A loop myopexy\nwas performed by passing a silicone band beneath the inferiorly displaced lateral\nrectus, and nasally displaced superior rectus. A 5.0 mm silicon sleeve was passed\nthrough the band to bring the muscle bellies into contact. The sleeve was then positioned\nposteriorly and anchored to the sclera with a 5.0 surgidac suture. A 7.0mm medial\nrectus recession was also performed. Following surgery, and at the 10 month follow\nup, the patient had a 4 pd esotropia.\nConclusion: Myopic strabismus fixus is a rare, motility disorder that results in progressive esotropia.\nIt should always be considered in patients with axial myopia and progressive esotropia.\nLoop myopexy is the preferred treatment.","title":"Restrictive Myopathy of High Myopia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185101\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        NOVA Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Protocols on daily patching\nduration have been established based on the patient's visual acuity. However, patching\ndoes not easily facilitate the development of a binocular system. New research has\nshown improvement in acuity and binocularity of strabismic amblyopes through the use\nof Monocular Fixation in a Binocular Field (MFBF).\nPURPOSE: This poster\npresents a case where visual acuity improved in a refractive amblyope through the\nuse of MFBF concurrently with vision therapy, and without daily patching.\n\nCase Report: CASE REPORT: An 8-year-old white male presented for an amblyopia evaluation,\nreferred by an outside provider. Entering acuity without correction was OD 20/20 OS\n20/125 PH 20/80. A comprehensive eye examination with cycloplegic refraction and dilation\nevaluation yielded best-corrected visual acuity 20/20 OD 20/70 OS with 5.00D hyperopic\nanisometropia, suppression OS on all binocular tests, and unremarkable ocular health.\nA diagnosis of refractive amblyopia OS was made, and a full-time spectacle Rx was\nprescribed with 6-week follow-ups until visual acuity stabilized. After three months\nwith compliance, best-corrected visual acuity achieved was 20/20 OD 20/60 OS. Vision\ntherapy with emphasis on MFBF techniques and no patching was prescribed after thorough\ndiscussion with the patient's parent. Visual acuity and stereopsis was re-checked\nafter ten sessions. Best corrected visual acuity of the amblyopic eye had improved\nfrom 20/60 to 20/30, global stereopsis improved to 250\" global stereopsis and 25\"\nlocal stereopsis. No suppression was noted on any binocular test.\nConclusion: CONCLUSIONS: This case presents an amblyopic patient whose visual acuity improved\nthrough the use of MFBF and vision therapy rather than the use of current patching\nprotocols. This further supports the possibility of MFBF as a viable method of improving\nvisual acuity in refractive amblyopes in lieu of patching.","title":"Improvement in Visual Acuity in a Monocular Refractive Amblyope with MonocularFixation  in a Binocular Field MFBF Techniques","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185102\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The aim of the study was to establish the prevalence\nof non-strabismic vergence anomalies and their relationship with age and gender among\nschool children In Abia State.\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with 550 (aged 10-16 years) children selected\nfrom 9 schools using stratified, cluster, random sampling. The participants completed\na Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) and vision assessment procedures\nincluding the measurement of visual acuity, refraction, cover test, measurement of\nnear point of convergence, fusional vergences, accommodative functions and ocular\nhealth evaluation.\nResults: Data were analysed for 533 participants that met the eligibility criteria. The prevalence\nof vergence anomalies include, convergence insufficiency (9.9%), convergence excess\n(2.9%), basic exophoria (1.7%), basic esophoria (2.8%), divergence insufficiency (0.8%)\nand divergence excess (0.6%). The prevalence of convergence insufficiency was significantly\nhigher in older children than younger children (p < 0.01) and as expected\ntherefore with secondary school children than primary school children (p <\n0.01). No other vergence anomaly showed any statistically significant associations\nwith age and school level. Similarly, there was no statically significant association\nbetween gender and various vergence anomalies.\nConclusion: A significant proportion (19.5%) of school children in Abia State are affected by\nclinically significant vergence anomalies. Between vergence anomalies and demographic\nvariables, only the distribution of convergence insufficiency was influenced by age.\nConsidering the implications for education and school performance, early detection\nand successful treatment is very important.","title":"Prevalence of Vergence Anomalies Among School Children in Abia State Nigeria","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185103\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of KwaZulu-Natal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Rekha Hansraj, Samuel Wajuihan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of KwaZulu-Natal, University of KwaZulu-Natal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

They can affect the visual pathway causing decreased vision and visual field\ndefects. Depending on their size and location, surrounding structures can be infiltrated\nmaking their removal fraught with complications. Stereotactic radiosurgery has emerged\nas a successful, minimally invasive alternative to surgery, especially for small and\nmedium-sized tumors.\nThis poster will review the epidemiology and possible\nrisk factors of meningiomas, treatment options, and long-term outcomes. Additionally,\na case of a patient with a cavernous sinus meningioma who had his vision restored\nafter Gamma Knife Stereostatic Radiosurgery will be presented.\n\nCase Report: A morbidly obese 64-year-old male presented March 2013 with a one month complaint\nof blurred vision and a central scotoma in his right eye. Best corrected visual acuity\nwas 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils, anterior and posterior segment findings were unremarkable.\nA right hemianopic defect and a superior left quadrantanopsic defect were noted on\nperimetric testing. Open MRI revealed a large meningioma along the right side of the\nplanum sphenoidale extending into the cavernous sinus with mass effect upon the pituitary\ngland, optic nerve and chiasm. Tumor displacement of the right middle cerebral artery\nand partial encasement of the right carotid artery limited the options for obtaining\nsuccessful treatment with standard surgery, therefore Gamma Knife Stereostatic Radiosurgery\nwas performed . Five years since initial tumor diagnosis, the size of the meningioma\nhas reduced slightly in size, and the vision has been restored to 20/20 OD with improved\nvisual field defects OU.\n\nConclusion: Gamma Knife Stereostatic Radiosurgery is a safe treatment option for patients with\nsmall and medium sized cavernous sinus meningiomas. It can also prevent further tumor\nprogression in larger sized tumors when alternate treatment options are prohibitive.\nAs such, it may help to preserve and restore vision.","title":"Restoring Vision with Gamma Knife Stereostatic Radiosurgery for Meningiomas","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185087\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA Hudson Valley Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

His vision was 20/20 unaided in the\nright eye and left eye at basic training, 12 months ago. The anterior segment was\nnormal in both eyes. A dilated fundus examination indicated bilateral swollen optic\nnerves. The fundus photos, OCT RNFL, and Humphrey visual field were documented. Laboratory\nworks such as bartonella, antibody panel, rapid plasma reagin, Lyme disease antibody,\nTreponema pallidum IgG, quantiferon, tuberculosis skin test, and complete blood count\n(CBC) were ordered and the results were normal.

Cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cutaneous,\npupillary and genito-urinary systems can be involved either globally or through focal\nseizure activity. While seizures have been well documented in moderate and severe\ntraumatic brain injury (TBI) there is less consensus on their relationship in mild\nTBI or concussion. Could the sequelae of a mild TBI aggravate seizure activity in\na patient with a pre-existing epilepsy diagnosis? Visual stimulation following concussion\nprovokes symptoms of photophobia, headache, eye strain, fatigue, light-headedness\nand visual motion sensitivity. Could the cortical hypersensitivity to visual stimulation\nfollowing concussion create autonomic imbalance triggering seizures? Can reduction\nof visual stimulation help to control focal seizure-like events?\n\nCase Report: A 54-year-old right-handed Caucasian female was involved in a motor vehicle collision\nand suffered a concussion. She has a medical history of epilepsy diagnosed 30 years\nprior with petit mal and complex partial seizures. Past medical history is also positive\nfor hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity which was treated with gastric sleeve\nsurgery. Since her accident she reports a new onset of uncontrolled burping episodes\nbrought on by bright lights, patterns and visual motion. During the examination she\nrequests that we minimize our hand and body movements and that we cover up our patterned\nclothing. She also asks that we limit the speed at which we present our equipment\nin front of her eyes. Despite these accommodations, she still exhibits episodes of\ncontinuous belching which leaves her exhausted and nauseated. Darkly tinted prosthetic\ncontact lenses were fitted in order to dim the oncoming light and dull the edges between\nbordering shapes and patterns, thereby reducing visual contrast. Prosthetic contact\nlenses along with a comprehensive concussion rehabilitation program effectively controls\nher burping episodes allowing her to return to her job as a high school English teacher.\nConclusion: Photosensitive epileptic seizures are caused by hyper-excitability of the visual cortex\nand related pathways. High contrast and high luminance targets with rapid motion and\nflicker can act as triggers. Migraine sufferers and those with post-concussion symptoms\nshare similar cortical hyper excitability. Reduction of contrast and luminance through\nthe use of darkly tinted prosthetic contact lenses may be a viable treatment option\nin certain forms of seizure activity and in migraine sufferers and post-concussion\npatients bothered by visually complex environments and visual motion sensitivity.","title":"Uncontrolled Burping Aggravated by Visual Stimuli in a PostConcussion Patient with  Remote Epilepsy History","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185090\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University, Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This often presents as part of the ocular\ntilt reaction triad comprised of vertical deviation, ocular torsion and head tilt.\nClinical presentations of skew deviation can mimic findings of other causes of vertical\nmisalignment, specifically cranial nerve (CN) IV palsy, making it difficult to differentiate.\n\nCase Report: This case report features a 38-year-old male complaining of constant binocular diplopia\nfollowing a moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) from a motor vehicle accident in\nwhich he sustained bilateral subdural hematoma and diffuse axonal injury. He presented\nto the eye clinic with a left head tilt and a large right hypertropia that isolated\nto the right superior oblique muscle. Extra-ocular motility pattern revealed a right\ninferior-oblique overaction with large vertical fusional reserves, indicative of a\npre-existing congenital CN IV palsy. Cyclotorsion testing revealed in-cyclotorsion\nof the hyper (right) deviated eye and ex-cyclotorsion of the hypo (left) deviated\neye; findings which are suggestive of a skew deviation. When comparing the hypertropia\nin upright to supine position, no changes were found, which is inconsistent with an\nisolated skew. Therefore, an MRI of the brain was ordered to rule out other neurological\ncauses. The MRI showed areas of encephalomalacia and gliosis along with ventriculomegaly\nconsistent with the patient's moderate TBI history. A final diagnosis of traumatic\ncentral skew deviation that occurred in conjunction with a congenital CN IV palsy\nwith traumatic decompensation was made based on the history and diagnostic clinical\ncriteria.

Central skews can be pre-nuclear or supranuclear depending on the areas\nof the midbrain involved. Differentiating a skew deviation from cranial nerve IV palsy\ncan be difficult due to the various combinations of disconjugate vertical ocular deviations.\nNovel clinical diagnostic tests to differentiate a skew deviation from other causes\nof vertical strabismus include the upright-supine test along with examining the ocular\ntilt reaction triad.\nThis case report exemplifies the complexity in the diagnosis\nof a traumatic central skew deviation.

This case describes how\ncentral and peripheral fusion are disrupted due to vitreomacular traction.\n\nCase Report: A 76-year-old Caucasian female presented with complaints of binocular vertical and\nhorizontal diplopia that only occurred in the dark or in a dimly lit room. She was\ndiagnosed with an epiretinal membrane in the right eye causing vitreomacular traction\nand displacement of the fovea. No treatment for the epiretinal membrane was deemed\nnecessary by her retinal ophthalmologist. Cover test revealed a 6-prism-diopter concomitant\nright hypertropia and a 4-prism-diopter intermittent right esotropia at distance and\nnear. Aniseikonia was also reported on alternating cover test. The lights-on-off test\nwas performed in office to confirm the diagnosis of dragged-fovea diplopia syndrome.\nInterestingly, the test results were negative based on the criteria described by De\nPool et al. Prismatic correction provided some relief, but fusion remained unstable\nand fragile. Other treatment options were trialed but were not well tolerated, including\nsize lenses, spot patching with Bangerter foil, and monovision spectacle correction.\nIn the end, the patient elected for prism correction as it helped make fusion easier\nand the diplopia in the dark more tolerable.\nConclusion: Epiretinal membranes are typically benign and do not elicit visual symptoms. However,\ncentral and peripheral fusion can be affected by vitreomacular traction, especially\nif the fovea of one or both eyes are involved. De Pool et al. described a diagnostic\ntest, the lights-on-off test, which they reported as being pathognomonic for dragged-fovea\ndiplopia syndrome. Despite clinical signs and symptoms that suggested dragged-fovea\ndiplopia syndrome, the test results were negative for the patient in this case, indicating\nthat there may be more to the conflict between central and peripheral fusion.\nOverall,\nintractable diplopia caused by vitreomacular traction can be frustrating for patients\nand difficult to treat by practitioners as prism correction and strabismus surgery\ncannot fully correct the diplopia. Aniseikonia can also contribute to the diplopia\nand should be ruled out and managed with size lenses when appropriate. Treating the\nvitreomacular traction directly through vitrectomy and membrane peel has the potential\nto improve visual outcomes and eliminate the diplopia. However, prognosis greatly\ndepends on the chronicity of the condition as well as pre-operative visual acuities.\nThere are reports of persistent diplopia as well as new onset diplopia post-operatively\nin instances where the fovea remained displaced while visual acuity improved enough\nto make the image disparity that much more obvious.","title":"Seeing Double in the Dark A Case of DraggedFovea Diplopia Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185092\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Visual Symptoms Treatment Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Valerie Kattouf","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/when-diplopia-is-not-a-binocular-vision-issue","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Diplopia is often diagnosed and treated as a binocular vision issue. This case allows\nthe practitioner to understand the role of maculopathies in the presentation of diplopia.\n\nCase Report: A 54 year old male presents with horizontal diplopia. The patient's history is positive\nfor bilateral myopia and a traumatic retinal detachment with subsequent surgical repair\nOS. The patient reports blur OS and diplopia that he notes was present prior to the\nsurgical treatment. VA OD is 20/20, OS 20/40. A diagnosis of convergence insufficiency\nwas treated with 7 sessions of vision therapy. Post therapy data reflects stable clinical\nfindings of ortho at distance and a 14D IAXT at near. A tremendous improvement in\nconvergence ranges, vergence facility and NPC was noted. Six months post op and at\nthe conclusion of the seven sessions of vision therapy the patient reports to our\nclinic noting that diplopia remains at distance (has never been present at near).\nVA revealed OD stable at 20/20 and OS decreased to 20/70. Anterior segment evaluation\nof the lens reveals trace nuclear sclerosis OU. Posterior pole evaluation reveals\na scar inferior to the macula OS secondary to the surgical procedure. A macular OCT\nreveals an epiretinal membrane (ERM) and macular edema. Binocular diplopia is typically\ncaused by misalignment attributed to ocular motor dysfunction. The clinical findings\nin this case prove that intermittent diplopia is not always related to binocular vision\nissues. Maculopathies are atypical causes of diplopia. Variations in the anatomy of\nthe macula can affect foveal correspondence and create diplopia. Changes in retinal\nanatomy cause misalignment of the retinal elements and thus affect central and peripheral\nfusion. The patients OCT revealed macular puckering that contributed to the perception\nof intermittent diplopia. This clinical presentation has been termed \"Dragged-Fovea\nDiplopia Syndrome\". The maculopathy altered the photoreceptor arrangement thus altering\ncentral sensory fusion ability.\nConclusion: Determining the underlying etiology of diplopia is crucial to determining the proper\ntreatment approach for the patient. The patient consistently complained of diplopia\nat distance yet no exotropia was noted at distance. Treatment of diplopia secondary\nto Dragged-Fovea Diplopia Syndrome is not successful when instituting typical binocular\nvision treatment modalities. As with our patient orthoptic training does not eliminate\nthe symptoms. Prism is also unpredictable and is rarely successful because of the\netiology of disrupted macular elements in the affected eye vs. binocular misalignment.\nAvailable non-surgical treatment options rarely provide a complete cure. The use of\nmonocular occlusion in its various forms and monovision have proven to aid in controlling\nthe diplopia. Lastly, ERM peeling surgery may also eliminate diplopia.

The concept of post-traumatic autonomic imbalance will\nbe discussed. Therapeutic intervention is presented utilizing the short-acting cycloplegic\nagent, tropicamide 1.0% ophthlamic solution, in conjunction with established ocular\nmotor therapies to restore comfortable binocular vision.\n\nCase Report: 3 female patients; a 45-year-old, 44-year-old and 39-year-old, presented with symptoms\nof eyestrain and diplopia following a TBI. Upon examination they each had blurred\nvision, abnormal accommodation, convergence and pupil reaction. They each reported\nasthenopia and ocular discomfort when using their eyes during sustained visual tasks.\nThey were diagnosed with spasms of the near reflex induced by their acquired brain\ninjury. After dilated fundus examination with 1 drop tropicamide 1.0% ophthalmic solution\nin each eye, significant reduction in symptoms of ocular motor discomfort was reported.\nThe ciliary spasm, the source of pain in uveitis, is typically treated with cycloplegic\nagents such as cyclopentolate or homatropine. In the current study ocular motor therapy\nand near reading glasses were accompanied by tropicamide 1.0% a short-acting cycloplegic\nagent, in order to quell the symptoms of eyestrain and remove boundaries to successful\ntherapy.\nConclusion: TBI has been linked to systemic autonomic imbalance involving excess sympathetic tone.\nOcular accommodation and convergence are parasympathetic activities and exhibit reduced\neffectiveness in the presence of excess sympathetic tone. Greater demand is then placed\non accommodation and convergence to overcome the excess tone. This results in painful\nciliary muscle spasm. Cycloplegia relieves the ocular discomfort of ciliary spasm\nwhile a pair of reading glasses provides the near clarity. Ocular motor therapies\ncan then proceed comfortably in order to restore visual homeostasis. This case series\ndescribes 3 patients who were prescribed tropicamide 1% ophthalmic solution along\nwith their vision rehabilitation activities. While cyclopentolate and homatropine\nare longer-acting cycloplegics they allow less time during each day in a drop-free\nstate. Tropicamide 1%, a shorter duration parasympatholytic cycloplegic agent, provides\nsmall windows of time each day where its effectiveness wanes allowing the patient\nto control their own oculomotor system. A key element for lasting success in vision\nrehabilitation is the gradual re-introduction of normalcy. A short acting cycloplegic\nagent such as tropicamide 1.0% is therefor considered advantageous over cyclopentolate.\nThis paper shows the effectiveness and rationale behind therapeutic intervention utilizing\ntropicamide 1% ophthalmic solution for the induced spasm of the near reflex following\ntraumatic brain injury.","title":"Spasm of the Near Reflex in Traumatic Brain Injury Utilizing Tropicamide 1 Ophthalmic  Solution as a Theraputic Intervention","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185094\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University, Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lynn Greenspan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University, Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The hallmark symptom\nof posterior scleritis is moderate to severe pain, classically waking the patient\nfrom sleep. Fundoscopic examination may reveal choroidal effusion/folds, swelling\nof the optic nerve, and/or exudative retinal detachment. However, it is uncommon for\nposterior scleritis to present with optic nerve hyperemia. The following is an atypical\ncase of posterior scleritis.\n\nCase Report: 60 y/o male was referred by his PCP for left eye ache for one week. His uncorrected\nvision was 20/20 OD/OS. EOMs were full with no pain on eye movement OU; pupils were\nnormal with no APD; and CVF were full OD/OS. Color vision testing was normal OD/OS,\nand there was no proptosis noted OS. IOP and anterior segment were unremarkable OU.\nPosterior segment exam revealed mild optic nerve hyperemia with faint chorioretinal\nfolds radiating from the disc to the fovea OS. MRI of brain and orbit with and without\ncontrast was ordered on day 1 for suspicion of intraconal retrobulbar mass. Imaging\nrevealed intense enhancement of the left retro-orbital soft tissues with thickening\nof the posterior sclera. B-scan ultrasound revealed a classic \"T-sign\" with scleral\nthickening indicative of posterior scleritis. Laboratory results were noncontributory.\nThe patient was prescribed indomethacin 25 mg TID PO with complete resolution of symptoms\nafter 1 week.\n\nConclusion: Patients with posterior scleritis generally present with deep, dull pain that may\nbe exacerbated by eye movement. Posterior segment findings may include choroidal effusion/folds,\noptic nerve head edema, and exudative retinal detachment. However, it is possible\nthat no fundoscopic signs may be present. In this rare case, the patient presented\nwith minimal pain, and the only fundoscopic findings were optic nerve hyperemia and\nchorioretinal folds. It is important to correctly identify patients with posterior\nscleritis and to order the appropriate laboratory testing for associated systemic\ndiseases; although, this patient's case was deemed idiopathic. Various imaging methods\ncan help in the diagnosis of suspected posterior scleritis, including B-scan ultrasound,\nOCT, and MRI of the brain.  This case highlights the importance of a careful\nfunduscopic exam in patients presenting with eye pain. The degree of vision loss from\nposterior scleritis is variable and treatment is key to recovery and preservation\nof vision. In addition, complete systemic workup should be initiated to investigate\nfor an underlying condition that could potentially be life-threatening. Posterior\nscleritis, although rare, is a differential diagnosis that should be considered and\npromptly recognized in those with eye pain and optic nerve hyperemia.","title":"Doctor My Eye Aches An Idiopathic Case of Posterior Scleritis Presenting with Optic  Nerve Hyperemiabr","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185082\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Suzzane Li, Carla Engelke\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System, Southern Arizona VA Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Neuro-imaging is crucial\nin correctly identifying the underlying pathologic process.","title":"Unilateral Painful Vision Loss Secondary to Compressive Anterior Clinoid Mucopyocele","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185085\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Iowa\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

A rare\nbut possible cause can be cervical intervention procedures in the c3-c6 area. This\ncase presents an oculosympathetic paresis secondary to cervical fusion surgery.\n\nCase Report: A 58-year-old female with C4/5 disc herniation and modest C5/6 and C3/4 herniation\nunderwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF). Two-level ACDF with Titan\nCage was performed via a right-sided exposure. Surgery was mostly uneventful and postoperatively\nthere were no surgical complications. The patient was referred 2 months post-surgery\nwith mild ptosis, anisocoria, and ipsilateral conjunctival injection. After exclusionary\ntests for Horner's syndrome were performed, the patient was diagnosed with Horner's\nsyndrome secondary to ACDF. The cervical sympathetic trunk (CST) runs 10-15 mm lateral\nto the medial edge of the longus colli muscle (LCM) and exists in the loose fascia\nand approaches most medially at C6. As cited (Allen & Meyer, 2009), during the decompressive\nprocedure, it is possible the right edge of the LCM on the level of C6 was compromised.\nConclusion: Knowledge of the anatomical relation between the CST and the LCM is very important\nto avoid Horner syndrome in ACDF. Surgery to the cervical region of the spine is a\npotential cause of Horner's syndrome (Allen & Meyer, 2009). As reported and rare,\nACDF surgery should be considered by the eye care practitioners in a differential\nof sudden onset Horner's syndrome.","title":"ACDF Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion case of Horners syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185076\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        VA N Texas Healthcare\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

This was\npreviously diagnosed in another clinic eight months earlier and followed for three\nmonths. The optic disc edema was noted to be nonresolving, with only minimal paracentral\nscotoma on visual field testing on review of records. His presenting complaints were\nlimited to mild increase in blurred vision bilaterally and dry eyes since his last\nexamination five months ago. Best corrected visual acuities revealed 20/25 right eye\nand 20/20 left eye. Physical examination was significant for right eye proptosis with\nrestricted abduction, which on further questioning, elicited a positive response for\nintermittent diplopia. Examination also showed marked right optic nerve edema with\nnormal retinal structures, and a normal left eye. Computed tomography with contrast\nof the head and orbit was ordered emergently, which demonstrated an orbital mass in\nthe right eye. The patient was referred to an oculoplastic surgeon for biopsy, confirming\nstage IV metastatic carcinoma with the prostate as the most likely primary source.\nProton emission tomography revealed no other sites of metastasis. External radiotherapy\nwas initiated. The outcome was a diminished orbital mass resulting in almost complete\nresolution of optic nerve edema, reduction of proptosis, and preservation of his presenting\nvisual acuity.\nConclusion: Typically, optic nerve head edema will resolve within eight weeks concerning NAION.\nAs this case report shows, when there is failure of the edema to resolve within this\ntimeframe, other etiologies including compressive optic neuropathy must be considered.","title":"Orbital Metastatic Carcinoma Initially Presenting as Isolated Optic Disc Edema","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185077\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Bay Pines VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Varun Khedekar\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Bay Pines VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Treatment consists of surveillance, with radiation being reserved\nfor evidence of progressive worsening of structure or function.\nCase Report: CASE REPORT: A 69 year-old woman is found to have features of a mild optic neuropathy\nin the setting of an ipsilateral supraduction limitation, localizing to the right\norbit. Imaging uncovers a right ONSM. Serial monitoring of visual function and imaging\nremain stable for a few years. Then, the patient reports worsening of vision to her\nneurosurgeon, who, along with radiation oncology, arrange for her to be fit with a\nmask in preparation for initiation of radiation treatment. In the interim, eye examination\ndemonstrates stability OD, but a new abduction deficit OS, which prompts halting of\nradiation consideration due to suspicion of an unrelated cause for her worsening diplopia.\nRepeat imaging finds a new left cavernous sinus arachnoid cyst and no change in the\nright ONSM. Treatment now consists of surveillance and prism glasses, with no indication\nfor radiation.\n\nConclusion: DISCUSSION: Radiation treatment is reserved for progressively worsening ONSM due to\nthe fact that the radiation itself can cause vision loss while attempting to treat\nthe ONSM. For that reason, it is imperative to fully examine ONSM patients with complaints\nof worsening vision to be sure the worsening is truly related to interval change of\nthe ONSM. Never assume that progressive vision loss has to be secondary to a known\npathology.

The patient reported that his last eye exam was\n4 years ago and was diagnosed with a swollen optic nerve in the left eye but did not\nfollow-up with neurology as instructed. Upon examination, best-corrected visual acuities\nwere 20/20 in the right eye, 20/150 in the left, and there was a relative afferent\npupillary defect in the left eye. The left eye was slightly proptotic. Fundus examination\nrevealed a swollen left optic nerve with tortuous retinal veins, choroidal folds and\npigment changes within the macula. The right eye was healthy and unremarkable. Optical\ncoherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macula were performed\nwhich showed increased RNFL thickness, and a convex appearance to the macula with\ndisruptions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium of the left eye. An MRI\nof the orbits showed a 2.5 cm high signal retrobulbar mass. The patient underwent\na left lateral orbitotomy with an ocular oncologist to remove the intraorbital mass\nwhich was a biopsy-confirmed cavernous hemangioma. At 6-month follow-up, best corrected\nvision in the left eye improved to 20/60, however, due to symptomatic, non-comitant\ndiplopia, the patient preferred to remain uncorrected in the left eye. The patient\nhas had follow-ups with the ocular oncologist, and has not had recurrence of the cavernous\nhemangioma.\nConclusion: Cavernous hemangiomas are the most common intraconal tumors found in adults. There\nare many differential diagnoses in evaluating a patient with a swollen optic nerve,\nand as such, it is important to note other ocular signs that may be present. In this\ncase, the patient's left eye was proptotic, and demonstrated retinal changes consistent\nwith a retrobulbar mass.

This study examined the frequency of abnormal SD-OCT flags on optic\nnerve cube scans and the factors associated with these abnormal flags.\nMethods: Subjects for this study were recruited in the exhibit hall of the 2017 American Academy\nof Optometry Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. After informed consent was obtained, subjects\ncompleted an intake questionnaire that included data for age, gender, ethnicity, height,\nweight, refractive error, medication use, eye health, and systemic health information.\nNo subjects reported glaucoma or other optic nerve disease. Each subject underwent\nOCT imaging of the right optic nerve, followed by intraocular pressure and blood pressure\nmeasurements in upright and inverted positions. Mean ocular perfusion pressure (MOPP)\nwas then calculated. All SD-OCT images with a scan quality > 7 were reviewed by\na panel of experts and were excluded if abnormal flags were related to poor centration,\nsegmentation error, or anomalous optic nerve appearances. Frequency of abnormal flags\nwas recorded for rim area (RA), vertical cup-to disc ratio (VCDR), total retinal nerve\nfiber layer (RNFL) thickness, superior RNFL thickness, inferior RNFL thickness and\nthe 6, 7, 8, and 11:00 RNFL clock-hour sectors. Multivariate regression analyses were\nused to explore relationships between RNFL, RA, VCDR, and the other variables obtained\nfor this study.\n\nResults: Of 206 SD-OCT optic cube scans, 177 had sufficient quality and were included in this\nstudy. Mean age was 36.5 +/- 13.9 years and 56.8% were female. Ethnic makeup was 71.4%\nCaucasian, 22.8% Asian, 1.9% African American, 1.9% Latino, and 2% other. Frequency\nof flags for RNFL, RA, and VCDR varied from 3.4% (RA) to 5.1% (VCDR) to RNFL (10.2%);\nflag frequency was significantly higher for RNFL vs. RA; borderline significantly\nhigher for RNFL vs. VCDR; and not different between RA and VCDR. In multivariate regression\nanalyses, RNFL flags were independently related to refractive error, RA, and disc\narea; RA flags were independently related to RNFL, VCDR, and VCDR flags; and VCDR\nflags were independently related to RA and RA flags. We found no associations between\nMOPP and any OCT flags.\nConclusion: Conclusions: In our young, healthy sample, RNFL flags were twice as common as VCDR\nflags and thrice as common as RA flags. Although increasing myopia was associated\nwith higher frequencies of total and sectoral RNFL flags, this factor was not associated\nwith increasing RA or VCDR flags. These results suggest that, when interpreting SD-OCT\noptic nerve cube scans, clinicians should consider that RA and VCDR flags can occur\ncoincidently in normal eyes, while frequency of abnormal RNFL flags rises as myopia\nincreases.","title":"Comparative frequencies of SDOCT optic nerve imaging abnormalities in normal eyes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185066\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Veterans Admin.

This is a case presentation of a patient with Wernicke's encephalopathy\nthat presented to our clinic with ophthalmic manifestations.\n\nCase Report: A 22 year old Guatemalan male presented to our clinic from his primary care physician\nand the ER for recent bilateral progressive painless vision loss and tinnitus for\nthe past two weeks. The patient entered the US six months prior to today's visit and\nwas held at a detention center for three months. After his release, he experienced\nweight loss, hearing loss, difficulty with chewing food, and vomited frequently. It\nwas noted that he appeared very placid and his affect was flat. His best corrected\nvisual acuities were 20/200 OD, CF OS. Pupils were unremarkable and confrontational\nvisual fields were grossly normal. His eyes were aligned and extraocular motility\nwas grossly full and unrestricted. The patient failed Ishihara color vision testing\nwith each eye. Anterior segment was unremarkable. Goldmann tonometry revealed IOPs\nof 19 mmHg in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal appearing optic\nnerves without apparent atrophy or edema in both eye. The retina and blood vessels\nappeared unremarkable. Zeiss OCT scans of his RNFL and macula were unremarkable for\nboth eyes. Initial MRI of the brain with and without contrast was interpreted as unremarkable.\nLaboratory studies revealed normal folate and B12 levels. Subsequent visits over the\ncourse of the next six months revealed worsening of visual acuities to CF in each\neye. While the eyes remained aligned at primary gaze, extraocular motility worsened\nto significant bilateral horizontal gaze restriction with up-beat jerk nystagmus on\nattempted lateral gaze. Subsequent dilated fundus exams revealed bilateral progressive\noptic atrophy and pallor, most prominently temporally, which were consistent with.\nZeiss OCT scans of his RNFL.

A small percentage of patients treated with these agents have exhibited\nan initial and transient increase in tumor size due to inflammatory cell infiltration\nand necrosis, known as pseudo-progression (PsP). PsP due to immuno-oncology agents\nhas been reported in multiple tumors, including breast cancer. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal\nantibody used to treat HER2 receptor positive breast cancer, has been cited as a causative\nagent for PsP. Interestingly, the target for trastuzumab, HER2, has been found to\nbe expressed in 43% of meningiomas. The expression of a common receptor among different\ntumors represents a possible avenue for incidental cross reactivity on non-targeted\nneoplasms. The purpose of this case report is to present a patient with diplopia as\nthe initial sign of suspected meningioma pseudo-progression while being treated with\nimmuno-oncology agents for breast cancer.\n\nCase Report: A 64 year old woman presents for evaluation of new-onset diplopia at distance. Systemic\nhistory is remarkable for hypertension and stage IV breast cancer currently being\ntreated with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel. She is also status post resection\nof a large cerebello-pontine angle meningioma 3 years prior to presentation. At that\ntime, another meningioma was noted in the left Meckel's cave/lateral wall of the cavernous\nsinus. Examination in office revealed a subtle left abduction deficit. Concern for\nprogression of the known left cavernous sinus meningioma prompted neuro-surgical consultation.\nMeningioma pseudo-progression due to chemotherapy was the favored diagnosis.\nConclusion: The expression of a common receptor among different tumors, such as HER2 in both breast\ncancer and meningiomas, represents a potential route for cross-tumor- reactivity when\nimmuno-oncology agents, such as trastuzumab, are used. Final diagnosis of pseudo-progression\nwould require resection and clinical follow up. However to the best of the authors'\nknowledge, there has been no other case report which details suspected meningioma\npseudo-progression in the setting of chemotherapeutic treatment, including trastuzumab,\nfor breast cancer. The suspected pseudo-progression of our patient's established meningioma\nsecondary to chemotherapeutic cross-tumor-reactivity resulted in a CN VI palsy and\ndiplopia. Certainly, a myriad of other visual and ocular consequences are possible.\nTherefore, this case suggests that clinicians, throughout multiple disciplines, must\nbe aware that treatment with therapeutic immuno-oncology agents may affect tumors\nother than the targeted cancer type with potential resulting ocular visual impairment.","title":"Diplopia as the Presenting Sign of Suspected Meningioma PseudoProgression in the  Setting of Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer A Case Report","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185068\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Pediatric\nmultiple sclerosis refers to diagnosis before age 18, while late-onset multiple sclerosis\nis diagnosed after age 50.

It is the\nonly cranial nerve to exit the brainstem dorsally. This leaves it highly vulnerable\nto trauma or compression from elevated intracranial pressure anywhere along its course.\nA unilateral CN IV injury may result in diplopia from hypertropia which worsens on\ncontralateral downgaze and ipsilateral head tilting. A bilateral CN IV, despite having\nsimilar possible origins, can present with horizontal diplopia greater than vertical\ndiplopia which poses a diagnostic challenge.\nThis poster focuses on differentiating\nunilateral from bilateral CN IV palsy as well as from other forms of acquired horizontal\ndiplopia. It will describe the procedure of double Maddox rod testing in identifying\nexcyclotorsion. It will also address the significance of the primary gaze horizontal\ndeviation as well as the lateral gazes with alternating hyper deviation.\n\nCase Report: A 33-year-old male was referred for vision evaluation following a motor vehicle collision\nwith a chief complaint of diplopia. Medical records describe sub-arachnoid hemorrhage\nand diffuse axonal injury. Ocular motility and cover test in nine positions of gaze\nreveals a large exo deviation with a small hyper deviation in primary gaze and relative\nrestriction of the ipsilateral eye in contralateral downgaze. Double Maddox rod testing\nexhibited 10-15 degrees of excyclotorsion in each eye consistent with bilateral CN\nIV palsy. Ocular fundus evaluation revealed excyclotorsion of the optic nerves as\njudged by the blood vessels off the discs. Differing amounts of relieving prim was\nnecessary throughout the recovery process for the gaze dependent diplopia. Vision\nrehabilitation therapies included range-of- motion and fusion activities.\nConclusion: Unilateral CN IV palsy presents as a hyper deviation worse on contralateral down gaze\nand ipsilateral head tilt. Excyclotorsion is present towards the ipsilateral shoulder.\nIn this case of bilateral CN IV involvement both eyes have a hyper deviation which\ndecreases the vertical disparity between them. Both eyes struggle to look downward\nresulting in a small asymmetry in their vertical deviation. Excylcotorsion of each\neye 10-15\no\ncan result in a large exo deviation in bilateral CN IV palsy.\nRelieving prism for bilateral CN IV trauma can be horizontal greater than vertical\ncomponent.

There is an interdisciplinary approach when addressing\nthe symptoms of these patients; however, optometrists are ideal in managing this condition\nas surgery is usually reserved for severely symptomatic patients and those who have\nfailed trialing prisms.\nAlso, radiological imaging may be utilized to rule\nout a more insidious diagnosis as well as to image rectus displacement related to\nSES. However, because SES is associated with unique changes to the adnexa, neurologic\nevaluation and extensive imaging may not be required to definitively diagnose SES\nin most cases.","title":"Management of Sagging Eye Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185072\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        South Texas Veterans Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Dipti Singh\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        South Texas Veterans Health Care System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

It presents at birth or shortly after affecting the muscles\nthat control eye movements and facial expression. It can also be associated with other\ncraniofacial dysmorphias and abnormalities of the hands and feet. The cause of the\nsyndrome is unknown. The signs and symptoms are due to a complete or partial CV VII\nand bilateral or unilateral CN VI palsy. Due to the paralysis of the lateral rectus\nmuscles, patients are unable to move their eyes from side to side and may present\nwith strabismus. This case highlights typical findings that are seen with this rare\ndiagnosis and highlights the importance of making the correct referral for the best\nvisual outcome.\n\nCase Report: A 66 year old Caucasian male presented to the office with complaints of blurred vision\nwith glare in both eyes that started about one year ago. He also complained of loose\nlids from a birth defect that also resulted in watery eyes. His medical history was\npositive for NIDDM for 3 years, Moebius syndrome, Hypertension, Gout, congenital foot\ndefects and high cholesterol. He was currently taking metformin, atorvastatin and\namlodipine. He had no known allergies to medications. His ocular history was positive\nfor ectropion, lagopthalmus, eversion of the bilateral punctum and cataracts. He had\na history of reconstructive lid surgery in 1985. His entering acuities OD and OS 20/50,\npinhole NI. His current prescription was OD: -7.75 -1.50 x 045 and OS: -7.00 -1.50\nx 123 with a +3.00 add. No improvement was found with manifest refraction and super\npinhole showed 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Glare testing was 20/125 OD and 20/100 OS. His\nEOMs showed a -4 abduction and adduction OD and OS, bilateral facial palsy, ptosis\nand ectropion of both lids. All other entrance testing was unremarkable. Anterior\nslit lamp examination showed 2+ diffuse superficial punctate epithelial keratitis,\nlagopthalmus and severe bilateral lower lid ectropion. Dilated fundus exam was unremarkable\nexcept for 3+ nuclear sclerotic cataracts in both eyes and a posterior vitreous detachment\nin the left eye. No signs of diabetic retinopathy were noted. Due to the severe ectropion\nhe was referred to oculoplastics surgery first and then once healed he would be sent\nfor cataract surgery. The patient presented to the office 6 months after receiving\nlid repair and his vision remained at 20/60 OD and OS. He was then sent for cataract\nsurgery in both eyes with a successful outcome of 20/30 OU.\nConclusion: Patients with this disorder present with poor eyelid construction due to the bilateral\nfacial palsy. This leads to decreased vision from lid laxity and poor eyelid closure.\nAs the patient ages and cataracts development it is important that one refer the patient\nfor eyelid surgery first to help maintain a better ocular surface for better vision\npost cataract extraction.","title":"A Case of Moebius Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185075\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        AZCOPT\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        joshua perkins\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        BDP Eye Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

If VR-QOL could be more precisely inferred by adding 10-2 VF information\nto 24-2 VF data, this would support a specific clinical role for routine 10-2 VF testing\nin glaucoma. This study was therefore designed to explore relationships between 24-2\nVF parameters, 10-2 VF parameters and VR-QOL within different stages of glaucoma.\nMethods: All subjects were participating in a longitudinal glaucoma research study at the Albuquerque\nVA Medical Center and were diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Diagnosis\nrequired the presence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy with corresponding repeatable\nVF loss in at least one eye. The NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire, a VR-QOL survey instrument\nconsisting of 25 questions that probe various aspects of everyday visual function,\nwas administered to each subject and cumulative VR-QOL scores were then calculated\nfor use in statistical analyses. Each subject completed 24-2 and 10-2 VF testing within\n6 months of taking the NEI-VFQ-25. Comprehensive Hodapp-Parrish-Anderson (HPA) criteria\nwere used to classify each eye's 24-2 visual field loss (none, mild, moderate, and\nadvanced) with subject-based stage defined by the better eye. Relationships between\nQOL scores and 24-2 and 10-2 VF parameters were then investigated within each VF stage\nusing pair-wise tests and linear regression analyses.\nResults: In 103 POAG subjects, 75% demonstrated 10-2 VF loss including 55 (53%) with 10-2 VF\nloss in one eye and 23 (22%) with 10-2 VF loss in both eyes. HPA staging of 24-2 VF\nloss revealed 56, 21, 14, and 12 subjects with no, mild, moderate, and advanced VF\nloss in their better eye respectively. When the better eye had no 24-2 VF loss, the\nonly VF parameter related to VR-QOL was 24-2 MD in that eye (r\n2\n= 0.13,\np=0.006). Similarly, when the better eye had mild 24-2 VF loss, 24-2 MD in that eye\nwas the only VF variable related to VR-QOL (r\n2\n= 0.24, p=0.03). Because\nof the small numbers of subjects in the moderate and advanced groups, these groups\nwere combined, and the parameter most closely associated with VR-QOL in the combined\ngroup was visual field index in the better eye (r\n2\n=0.14, P=0.06). No 10-2\nVF parameter in better or worse eyes was associated with VR-QOL within any stage of\nglaucoma.\nConclusion: Our results show that after VF staging based on 24-2 VF parameters, thereby limiting\nthe range of 24-2 parameters within each category, the better eye 24-2 VF parameters\nwere still more closely associated with VR-QOL than any of the 10-2 VF parameters.\nThese findings support the use of 24-2 parameters, but not 10-2 parameters, for predicting\nVR-QOL within different stages of glaucoma.","title":"Influence of 102 Visual Field Loss on VisionRelated Quality of Life within Different  Stages of Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185060\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Denise Pensyl, Suchitra Katiyar, Nimesh Patel, Michael Sullivan-Mee\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center, University of Houston, Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Tertiary syphilis is characterized by ocular, neurologic and cardiovascular\nmanifestations that can occur months to years following initial treponema infection.\nThe condition has a reputation for significant systemic and ocular morbidity.\n\nCase Report: A 71 year old female presented to the clinic for an intraocular pressure (IOP) check\nwith a diagnosis of chronic anterior uveitis and secondary open and closed angle uveitic\nglaucoma, OU. Review of the glaucoma flow chart revealed that as the glaucoma evolved\nbeyond topical medical control multiple surgical solutions were added to achieve appropriate\nIOP including laser trabeculoplasty and seton placement, OU. Further review of the\nchart uncovered a systemic history of type II diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,\natrial fibrillation, osteoporosis and a history of syphilitic infection diagnosed\nand treated in the patient's teens. Detailed scrutiny of the file exposed a 7 year\nhistory of aggressive secondary inflammatory open and closed angle glaucoma. Repeat\nlaboratory testing investigating the underlying cause of the ocular inflammation uncovered\na positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR 1:2) and positive fluorescent treponemal antibody\nabsorption test (FTA-ABS). Prompt referral to internist lead to the diagnosis of tertiary\nneurosyphilis with aggressive systemic treatment. Following the resolution of systemic\ndisease the glaucoma will be assessed for further surgical intervention.\nConclusion: Syphilis has the potential to become revitalized and produce recurrent ocular and\nsystemic complications at anytime during a previously infected person's lifetime.\nIn addition to the plethora of potential vision threatening complications associated\nwith chronic ocular inflammation, life threatening sequelae from neurologic progression\nremains the most pressing issue. We review IOHS, its causes, the management of uveitic\nsecondary open and closed angle glaucoma, acute intervention for emergently raised\nIOP from IOHS and summarize the surgical approaches for IOHS cases that fails to respond\nto topical therapy. The principle complications of chronic ocular inflammation including\nthe development of band keratopathy, granulomatous uveitis, early cataractogenesis,\nuveitic angle closure and phthisis bulbi are also reviewed along with their course,\npathophysiology and management. Syphilis is also examined with a discussion that includes\nthe appropriate systemic work up with appropriate repeat testing strategy for individuals\nwith a positive syphilitic history and the disease's classification, staging and systemic\nmanagement.

Linear\ntransformation, converting logarithmic (decibels) to linear (1/Lambert) data, was\ncarried out for 24-2 and 10-2 MD and PSD parameters. Pair-wise tests and linear regression\nanalyses were used to examine and compare relationships between VR-QOL scores, logarithmic\nVF data, and linear VF data.\n\nResults: In 171 subjects (103 POAG, 68 GS), logarithmic 24-2 MD (dB) and linear-transformed\n24-2 MD (1/L) demonstrated the strongest correlations with VR-QOL, with each parameter\nexhibiting equivalent associations (r\n2\n=0.20 for both, p<0.001). When\ncomparing all other logarithmic vs. linear parameters (MD and PSD, better and worse\neyes, 24-2 and 10-2 tests), the relationships between VR-QOL and logarithmic parameters\nconsistently exceeded those of linear parameters except for one comparison (worse-eye\n10-2 MD; r\n2\n= 0.17 linear vs 0.14 logarithmic). When evaluating rate of\n24-2 MD change over time, the logarithmic and linear 24-2 parameters demonstrated\nsimilar correlations to VR-QOL.\n\nConclusion: These results indicate that logarithmic VF data has equal or better associations with\nVR-QOL compared to linear VF data. Accordingly, linear transformation of VF parameters\ndoes not improve the prediction of VR-QOL measurements.","title":"Relationship between lineartransformed visual field parameters and quality of life  in glaucomabr","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185062\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Denise Pensyl, Suchitra Katiyar, Nimesh Patel, Michael Sullivan-Mee\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center, University of Houston, Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The sensitivity of spectral domain optical\ncoherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging to detect small but statistically significant\nchanges in retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, and inner plexiform layer\nthickness before the appearance of visual field change can have profound implications\non how persons with glaucoma are managed.\n\nCase Report:\nCase Report: An 81-year old black male with a 20-year history of primary\nopen-angle glaucoma presented for follow-up. Current treatment regimen is Travatan-Z\nq.h.s. OU, Simbrinza b.i.d OU and SLT OU. Visual field testing has been stable since\nhis first visual field in 1997 (Figure 1). However, SD-OCT shows extremely rapid progressive\nloss of circumpapillary RNFL thickness in the OD (Figure 1).\nConclusion: Discussion: This case brings forth a number of questions.

Thermal cameras\nare non-contact devices that require no illumination of the eye. It is known that\nthe Ocular Surface Temperature (OST) is lower in patients with Dry Eye Disease (DED).\nIt is also known that compliance to eye drops is reduced in many patients with glaucoma\nwho report ocular discomfort and dryness. The aim of this study was to use thermography\nto compare the effect of the low environmental humidity on OST in a group of subjects\nusing glaucoma eye drops compared to a control group.\nMethods: 21 subjects using glaucoma eye drops (68.4 ± 9.1 years old) and 20 controls subjects\n(65.7 ± 13.1 years old) were exposed to desiccating environmental stress (5% relative\nhumidity) for 1.5 hours in a Controlled Environmental Chamber (CEC) (PSR-B, WEISS\nGallenkamp). OST was measured using an infrared thermal camera (Therm-App Hz, Opgal\nOptronic Industries Ltd, Israel) before and after exposure to environmental stress.\nThermal images recorded over a central circular area of 9 mm diameter for 30 seconds\nwere analyzed using Mathematica to calculate the mean temperature as a function of\ntime. Cooling rate (°C/s) was calculated over a time of 4 seconds before and after\nexposure.\nResults: At baseline, in normal environmental conditions, the OST immediately after opening\nthe eye (T0) was significantly lower in the glaucoma group compared to the control\ngroup (p ? 0.05). After exposure to the low humidity, T0 did not change significantly\nin either groups (p > 0.05). Before exposure to the environmental stress, the cooling\nrate over 4 seconds was faster in the glaucoma group compared to the controls (p ?\n0.05). After being exposed to low humidity, the cooling rate increased significantly\nin the control group (p ? 0.05) but it did not change significantly in the glaucoma\ngroup (p > 0.05).\nConclusion: Clearly, the exposure to low humidity affected the dynamic of the temperature in the\nocular surface of the control group (p ? 0.05). However, this was not the case in\nthe glaucoma group (p > 0.05). This situation can be the result of a lower baseline\ntemperature in the glaucoma group with respect to controls (p ? 0.05) and an already\naltered temperature dynamics before the exposure to the low humidity in glaucoma (p\n? 0.05).","title":"The Effect of Environmental Stress on Ocular Surface Temperature in Patients with  Glaucoma","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185064\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Anglia Ruskin University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Juan Tabernero, Rupert Bourne, Shahina Pardhan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Anglia Ruskin University, Anglia Ruskin University, Anglia Ruskin University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Medical\nhistory was significant only for current fertility treatment to achieve pregnancy:\nGonal-F (follitropin-alfa for injection), a human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)\nrecombinant DNA preparation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured to be 26mmHg\nin the right eye and 69mmHg in the left. Gonioscopy revealed a bowed iris configuration\nin both eyes, and an angle open to posterior trabecular meshwork in two quadrants\nof the right eye, with no structures visible in the other quadrants. No structures\nwere visible in any quadrant of the left eye. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography\nconfirmed appositional angle closure, and the patient was referred for a laser peripheral\niridotomy (LPI), after medically lowering her IOP in-office. She was started on pilocarpine\n2% QID and Simbrinza® BID for use until the LPI could be performed, and IOP was stabilized\nat 13mmHg. The LPI was performed without complication. However, one week later she\nreturned to the clinic complaining of severe pain in the right eye, nausea, and photophobia.\nShe had discontinued all LPI post-operative medications two days prior due to an embryo\nimplantation procedure scheduled the following day, which was successful. IOP measured\nat this visit was 76mmHg in the right eye, 15mmHg in the left. Anterior segment OCT\nconfirmed appositional angle closure of the right eye. Though the patient's fertility\ndoctor was consulted and determined that the teratogenicity of pilocarpine required\nfor an LPI in the right eye would likely result in losing the developing embryo, the\npatient decided to have the LPI performed to avoid the continued pain and risk of\nblindness from angle closure glaucoma if left untreated.\nConclusion: There has been no established connection between fertility treatments and risk of\nangle closure, but sex hormone receptors are known to be found on many ocular tissues,\nincluding the lens, cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens, all of which are structures\nthat could directly or indirectly affect anterior chamber depth and susceptibility\nto angle closure. Because the prevalence of patients with narrow angles and the prevalence\nof patients undergoing fertility treatments is low, the prevalence of patients who\nhave both narrow angles and are also undergoing fertility treatments must be very\nlow. Therefore, angle closure events in patients undergoing fertility treatments must\nalso be a rarity. Yet, this case suggests a possible link between hormonal therapy\nin fertility treatments and increased risk of angle closure in patients with narrow\nangles.","title":"Bilateral Angle Closure in a Woman Undergoing Fertility Treatment","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185065\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        SUNY College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Eyes were randomized to receive low viscosity,\nemulsion, and gel formulated artificial tears. 3 Optic nerve head scans (ONH)(Optovue\niVue) were done before and again after drop installation. Change in signal strength\nwas used as the primary outcome measure.\nResults:\n52 consecutive patients with glaucoma and glaucoma suspects (104 eyes) were enrolled.\nAll 3 artificial tear formulations reduced signal strength after instillation. The\nreduction for the emulsion was not clinically significant (Mean(x) -1.22, Standard\nDeviation(Ïƒ)6.15, P=.28), however the low viscosity (x=-3.30 Ïƒ=6.83; p=0.002) and\ngel drops (x=-3.29 Ïƒ=6.06; p=0.003) was. There was no statistical difference between\nthe dry eye group and non-dry eye group with regards to change in signal strength\nwith artificial tear use(p=.55).\nConclusion:\nWhile previous studies have shown artificial tear use yields improvement in signal\nstrength with temporal domain OCT, the same can not be said for spectral domain OCT.\nSince the capture time was longer with temporal domain, we hypothesize that ocular\ncomfort, stability and ability to keep the eye open was a larger factor that was mitigated\nwith the use of an artificial tear. Our reduction in signal strength is likely due\nto increased reflections off of the tear film with artificial tear use and increased\naberrations with a thicker tear film. In clinical practice, we recommend doing OCT\ntesting before visual field testing if a drop is desired to improve visual field outcomes.\nIf an artificial tear must be used before OCT testing due to clinical constraints,\nwe recommend the use of an emulsion as it had the least negative impact on results.","title":"Impact of 3 Different Artificial Tears on Ocular Coherence Tomography Results","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185058\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dr. Schwartz Optometrist and Associates\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Melissa Snyder, Nathalee Bernabe, Milton Hom\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dr. Schwartz Optometrist and Associates, Private Practice, Private Practice\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Previously published reports show favorable outcomes and incremental\nbenefits of multiple iStent devices.\nMethods: Subjects with OAG on 1 to 3 ocular hypotensive medications were enrolled in this prospective\nrandomized study. Inclusion criteria included preoperative IOP of 18-30 mmHg on medication\nand 22-38 mmHg following medication washout.

Each participant completed a standardized step test to estimate\nVO2 max, which was used to prescribe individualized treadmill speeds representing\nthree exercise intensities (45%, 65%, and 95% VO2 max). In a random and repeated design,\nparticipants completed 2.0 km at each intensity. This experimental design isolated\npower (exercise intensity) as the variable of interest, while holding total work constant\nfor each condition (2.0 km). Baseline IOP, heart rate, and blood pressure were measured\nprior to each exercise intensity and again at time 0, 5, 10, and 20 minutes post-exercise.\nTime 0 IOP data was used for analysis. Repeated measures one-way ANOVA with post hoc\ntests compared IOP (time 0) for the four levels of exercise intensity (rest/baseline,\nlow, moderate, high).\nResults: Aerobic exercise using individualized treadmill speeds equivalent to 95%, 65%, and\n45% of estimated VO2 max significantly reduced IOP for all intensities relative to\nbaseline [Figure 1]. The 95% VO2 max intensity showed a more significant IOP reduction\nthan either the 65% VO2 max and 45%VO2 max intensities (p<0.001). IOP was reduced\nby a significantly greater degree between subjects with an estimated VO2 max ?44 versus\n<44, but only for the 95% VO2 max and 65% VO2 max intensities (p<0.05 for both\nintensity levels).\nConclusion: All exercise intensity levels were associated with an acute reduction of IOP with\nhigher intensities demonstrating a larger reduction in IOP. Subjects with a higher\nestimated VO2 max may benefit from larger IOP reductions, particularly at higher exercise\nintensities. Aerobic exercise, even at relatively low intensity, significantly lowers\nIOP and therefore should be considered as a complementary therapeutic option for patients\nwith glaucoma or those at risk for developing the condition.

Ocular hypertension\n(OHTN) is a known risk factor for GLC and is defined as an elevated intraocular pressure\n(IOP) above statistical norms with a lack of glaucomatous nerve damage. Lowering IOP\nvia topical pharmaceuticals is the primary treatment method for GLC and OHTN. Several\nstudies have demonstrated ophthalmic preparations of Forskolin (Coleus forskohlii\nroot) act as a potent adenylyl cyclase activator and increase the concentration\nof cAMP in the ciliary body epithelium of the eye, subsequently decreasing aqueous\nhumor production.\nWe propose that oral supplements of Forskolin, a derivative\nof the mint family, may serve as a natural therapy for lowering IOP.\nMethods: 38 subjects were enrolled in the study, all of which underwent a comprehensive dilated\neye exam within one year of participation and lacked significant systemic or ocular\nconditions. The subject groups were divided into those with normal IOP (n = 35)\nand OHTN (n = 3). Normal pressure was defined as 12-21 mmHg; OHTN was defined\nas >21 mmHg. In this double-blinded study, normal IOP participants were randomized\nto treatment or placebo accounting for age, race, and gender. OHTN patients took part\nin both study groups. Subjects took 500 mg oral Forskolin or oral placebo before dinner\nfor 28 days. Goldmann IOPs were evaluated at the beginning and end of the study.\nResults: Three patients were excluded from analysis secondary to noncompliance and one patient\nwithdrew following a single dose of Forskolin. Thirty-four individuals were analyzed,\n19 of which were on Forskolin and 19 on placebo. In the Forskolin group, the mean\nIOP for OD was initially 16.42 mmHg and 14.84 mmHg following treatment (p = .02),\nand the mean IOP for OS was 16.32 mmHg initially and 14.37 mmHG following treatment\n(p < .01). For those on the placebo pill, the mean IOP for OD was initially\n16.00 mmHg and 15.00 mmHg after treatment (p = .02), and the mean IOP for OS\nwas 16.05 mmHg initially and 15.00 mmHg after treatment (p = .04). Mean percent\ndecrease was found to be 8.51% for the Forskolin group and 6.14% for the placebo group\n(p = 0.61). A sub-analysis of the OHTN patients that participated in both study\ngroups showed a mean percent decrease of 17.94% for the Forskolin group and 4.12%\nfor the placebo group (p = 0.12).\nConclusion: Both groups observed a statistical decrease in IOP however when looking at the percent\ndecrease in IOP between the two groups there was no statistical difference observed.\nThe sub-analysis of OHTN patients similarly revealed a lack of statistical significance\nin mean decrease of IOP. Although the difference between the groups was statistically\ninsignificant a decrease of 17.94% in the Forskolin group shows clinical significance\nand warrants further investigation.","title":"A Further Investigation into Oral Forskolin Coleus forskohlii root Efficacy in Normal  and High Ocular Pressure","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185052\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Tina Porzukowiak, Amy Schweikert, Megan Rother, Parveen Bains, Dianne Settlage, Leah Collison, Eric Bushman, Amanda Brewer, Tyler Jevne, Balamurali Vasudevan, Michelle Mifflin, Shannon Scott\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Midwestern Univerisity- Arizona College of Optometry, Arizona College of Ostepathic Medicine, Arizona College of Ostepathic Medicine\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The Institutional Review Board at\nthe Illinois College of Optometry approved the study and all subjects completed informed\nconsent prior to participating in any study procedures. After subjects completed an\nintake questionnaire (that included data for age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight,\nrefractive error, medication use, eye health, and systemic health information), each\nsubject underwent SD-OCT imaging of the right optic nerve, followed by intraocular\npressure and blood pressure measurements in upright and inverted positions. Data analysis\nfor this report focused on regression analyses to explore relationships between degree\nof change in IOP upon inversion and several demographic, morphometric, and ocular\nparameters.\nResults: Two-hundred twenty-four eyes in 224 subjects were studied. Median age was 36.8 (25-75%:\n26.0,48.0) years and 57.0% were female. Ethnic makeup was 71% Caucasian, 23% Asian,\n2% African American, 3% Latino, and 1% other.

A better understanding of risk\nfactors, such as average central corneal thickness (CCT), that may differ uniquely\nin Haitians, would be extremely useful in screening for glaucoma more effectively\nin this population. For this purpose, corneal pachymetry measurements from a cross-section\nof individuals living in Haiti were evaluated.\nMethods: Eye examinations were performed on patients in May 2018 during a Volunteer Optometric\nService to Humanity (VOSH) mission trip in the town of Pont Sonde (population 10,000)\nlocated in the Artibonite region of Haiti. The examinations consisted of a brief history,\nvisual acuity at distance, intraocular pressures (iCare), retinoscopy (lens rack)\nor autorefraction (SVOne), and ophthalmoscopy (direct or indirect). On two days, pachymetry\nreadings were taken on approximately every third adult (over 18 years) as part of\nthe eye examination. The same examiner obtained all CCT measurements using a Reichert\niPac pachymeter.\nResults: The CCT measurements were performed on 186 patients: 57 males (31%) and 129 females\n(69%). Patient age ranged from 18-97 years, with 49.33 years as mean (SD 16.5, median\n48). The CCT measurements ranged from 379-624 um with a mean of 517.6 um in this Haitian\npopulation (SD 35.17, median 517). The intraocular pressures ranged from 7-47 mmHg,\nwith 17.02 mmHg as mean (SD 5.58, median 16).\nConclusion: The Haitian population tested was found to have a mean CCT of 517 um, differing significantly\nfrom the general population globally of 544 um. This markedly lower CCT may be an\nimportant contributing factor for the significantly higher incidence of glaucoma in\nHaitians. For this reason, intraocular pressure readings must be carefully evaluated\nsince they are artificially low in these individuals of Haitian descent.","title":"Central Corneal Thickness in a Native Haitian Population A CrossSectional Analysis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185054\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Mark Shust, Emilie Seitz, Victoria Shust\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Dept of Veterans Affairs, Philadelphia, Salus University, Salus University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

We will show images\nof several patients with various levels of glaucoma and how the new software can aid\nin management.\n\nCase Report: New glaucoma software for the SD-OCT allows the clinician to measure Minimum Rim Width\n(MRW) by calculating Bruch's Membrane Opening (BMO). This poster will present three\npatients where the new glaucoma software has shown to be an improvement over the existing\ncircle scan OCT. The first patient is a 62 yoWM with unusual vasculature. The images\n(see attached Fig 1) will show that the circle scan erroneously flags the superior\ntemporal RNFL quadrant and the MRW correctly identifies this area as WNL. The cause\nfor the circle scan error is due to the position of the superior retinal vein and\nartery being at 12:00 rather than shifted more temporally. The second patient is a\n29 yoWM with a temporal optic pit. This is causing edema of the retina and negatively\naffecting the data captured by the circle scan in the temporal quadrant. The MRW (see\nattached Fig 2) correctly identifies this area as WNL. This could also be the case\nwith epiretinal membranes etc. The third patient is a 76 yoWF with glaucoma, but the\nRNFL circle scan cannot obtain valuable data due to a large staphyloma; however the\nMRW provides useful data (no image at this time, but will be able to obtain for poster).\nI\nwill have several images available, not just the one I am able to upload here.\nConclusion: Circle scan RNFL OCTs are quite useful and a vital part of the modern management of\nour glaucoma patients. However there exist cases where the RNFL is unable to be properly\nmeasured at the retinal location. For these patients, and perhaps for all glaucoma\npatients, it's better to have a repeatable, quantifiable measure of glaucomatous progression\nat the location of the optic rim tissue. This poster will hope to show eye care providers\nthe need to 'think outside the circle.'","title":"BMO AND MRW The new glaucoma software Things you Need to Know to Encorparate it  in your Daily Practice","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185055\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Boston VA Healthcare System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The four\ncognitive tests included reasoning, reaction time, visual memory and prospective memory.\nSpectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging was used to measure\nthe retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), ganglion cell complex\n(GCC) and macular thicknesses. Poor cognitive function was categorized as failure\nof at least one or two cognitive tests. Failure of cognitive test was defined as the\nfollowing: 1) reasoning test with a score of < 3; 2) a reaction time of > 770msec;\n3) worse than 95% of participants in pairs matching >2 incorrect matches; 4) an\nincorrect answer on first attempt at the prospective memory test.

{"_type":"dict","author":"Erika Anderson","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/dacryoadenitis-with-a-unique-systemic-association","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Acute dacryoadenitis is uncommon and presents as edema and tenderness of the outer\nbrow and may have associated conjunctival injection. It typically occurs in children\nor young adults and can be infectious or inflammatory. The condition can be self-limiting\nbut may require treatment directed at the causative agent if one can be found. Bacterial\ndacryoadenitis is rare but can be associated with sexually transmitted infections\n(STI). Secondary syphilis is a highly infectious stage of syphilis that can present\nas acute dacryoadenitis that will resolve without treatment. Treatment of syphilis\nin the early stages can prevent the spread of the disease to others and stop progression\nwhich causes end organ damage over a lifetime. Early recognition and treatment of\nthis disease process is the key to avoiding life-changing outcomes.\n\nCase Report: This is a case report of a 23-year-old Navajo male who presented to the clinic with\na complaint of a swollen right brow that was red and watery. It began after the patient\nwas hit in his other eye 3 days prior. Upon examination, vision was found to be 20/30\nOD and 20/25 OS. He had mild restriction of all gazes OD with diplopia present in\nsuperior gaze; OS were full and smooth. He had pronounced edema and erythema of his\nright upper lid, with pain on palpation and mild ptosis. Temporal 3+ chemosis of the\nconjunctiva with injection was present. His intraocular pressure was 25mmHg OD and\n15mmHg OS. His posterior ocular health was unremarkable with 0.25 cup-to-disc ratios\nOD, OS without edema. Due to the acute onset with associated pain on eye movement,\na maxillo-facial CT was obtained with the following\nResults: right-sided dacryoadenitis\nwith inflammatory changes extending into the region of the myotendinous junction of\nthe lateral rectus and preseptal cellulitic changes. Labs were ordered to rule out\nsystemic causes. All labs were normal with the exception of the syphilis and Human\nImmunodeficiency (HIV) results. Syphilis testing included rapid plasmin reagin (RPR)\nthat was reactive with a 1:4 titer and confirmatory fluorescent treponemal antibody\nabsorption (FTA-ABS) was also reactive. The HIV screening test was positive as was\nthe confirmatory antibody test with HIV type 1 antibodies present. These results indicated\nthe patient had both syphilis and HIV. He was referred to the facility's infectious\ndisease specialist and obtained initial treatment for these conditions within one\nday of diagnosis which resulted in the resolution of his dacryoadenitis. He is now\nreceiving ongoing HIV treatment.\nConclusion: STIs are rising and can occur simultaneously with one another. Many have ocular findings\nthat may be recognized by an optometrist. Although rare, secondary syphilis may initially\npresent as acute dacryoadenitis. Proper testing and diagnosis dramatically limits\nthe potential morbidity and mortality of this condition and others that may occur\nwith it.","title":"Dacryoadenitis with a Unique Systemic Association","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185047\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Tsehootsooi Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Colby Barton\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Tsehootsooi Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Examination findings revealed bilateral pan uveitis with retinitis, exudative\nretinal detachments and mild optic nerve edema. Her history and systemic work up failed\nto reveal other systemic etiologies to her bilateral ocular finding, thus confirming\nthe diagnosis of VKH.

{"_type":"dict","author":"Jennifer Duan","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/bilateral-purtschers-retinopathy-secondary-to-pancreatitis","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Purtscher's retinopathy, first described in 1910, is a rare condition with an incidence\nof 0.24 cases per million per year. Clinical presentation includes retinal hemorrhages\nand ischemia due to complement-mediated leukoembolization. It's associated with compressive\nchest injuries, long bone fracture, retrobulbar anesthesia, acute pancreatitis, strenuous\nchildbirth and connective tissue diseases. In pancreatitis, proteases activate complement\nsystem and can cause coagulation and leukoembolization of retinal precapillary arterioles.\nWe review a case of bilateral purtscher's retinopathy secondary to pancreatitis.\n\nCase Report: A 50-year old African America male presented with a chief complaint of blur vision\nOU. He was recently diagnosed with acute pancreatitis secondary to alcoholism. Examination\nuncovered confluent cotton wool spots with areas of intraretinal hemorrhage and macula\ncystoid edema OU. The patient was urgently referred to the vitreoretinal specialist\nfor treatment. There is no proven therapy for retinopathy; however, ophthalmologist\ninitiated prednisolone acetate 1%, ketorolac and dorzolamide treatment to manage macula\nedema. We notified patient's internist for pancreatitis management and closely monitored\nthe patient for 3 months. During the 3\nrd\nmonth retinal follow up, his retinopathy\nand macular edema were both resolved.

Around 85% of\nUS population consume caffeinated beverages daily. Caffeine consumption varies worldwide\nwith 20-30% of the general population consuming 500-600mg (4-6 cups) of caffeine daily.\nThe purpose of the study was to observe the effect of caffeine on tear film quality\namong normal healthy adults.\nMethods: This two visit randomized placebo-controlled crossover study included 45 normal healthy\nadults aged 18 years and above who received 200mg of caffeine or placebo (magnesium\ncalcium) capsules. Initial screening following the eligibility criteria was assessed\nprior to participation. Informed consent form in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki\nwas attained from each subject. Subjects with no ocular pathologies, refractive surgeries,\nand systemic illness participated in this study. Non-invasive tear break-up time was\nmeasured with Medmont corneal topographer at baseline, one hour and two hour time\ninterval.\nResults: The mean age of subjects was 25.58±1.83 years. Mixed model analysis of covariance\n(ANCOVA) showed no significant difference between placebo and caffeine groups at one\nhour (F=1.135, p=0.288, d=0.26) and two hours (F=2.119, p=0.148, d=0.14). Though there\nwas no significance, with caffeine consumption, the tear break-up time increased to\n5.26 seconds at one hour from baseline measurement (5.13 seconds). Similarly, at two\nhours, tear break-up time increased to 5.33 seconds with caffeine intake. With placebo\ncapsule intake, the tear break-up time increased to 5.69 seconds at one hour from\nbaseline measurement (5.13 seconds); and at two hours it increased to 5.7 seconds\nfrom baseline measurement. There was no significant association observed between gender\nand tear film quality (p=0.680).\nConclusion: Caffeine consumption from this study showed a small, insignificant improvement on\ntear film quality without any degradation in tear break-up time. Since improved tear\nfilm quality can potentially enhance visual performance, especially for dry eye patients,\nfurther studies may elucidate if caffeine intake improves the quality of tear film.","title":"Effect of Caffeine on Tear Film Quality Among Normal Healthy Adults","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185037\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Amiee Ho, John Hayes, Scott Cooper\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry, Pacific University College of Optometry, Pacific University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The\nARMOR study evaluates in vitro antibiotic resistance among Staphylococcus aureus,\ncoagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus\ninfluenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from ocular infections.\nHerein, we report resistance/susceptibility profiles for ocular pathogens collected\nduring the full 2017 calendar year.\nMethods: Participating centers across the US submitted clinically relevant ocular isolates\nto an independent central laboratory for in vitro susceptibility testing. Minimum\ninhibitory concentrations were determined by broth microdilution per Clinical and\nLaboratory Standards Institute guidelines for up to 16 antibiotics (10 classes), and\nisolates were classified as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant based on available\nbreakpoints. Staphylococci were classified as methicillin-resistant (MR) or methicillin-susceptible\n(MS) based on oxacillin resistance/susceptibility.\nResults: A total of 617 isolates were collected from 26 participating US sites across 18 states.\nNo resistance to tested drugs was observed among the 96 H. influenzae isolates.\nNearly all 87 isolates of P. aeruginosa were susceptible, with only a few isolates\nexhibiting resistance to fluoroquinolones (5%) and polymyxin B (5%). Of the 53 S.\npneumoniae isolates, 36% were resistant to azithromycin and 32% were resistant\nto oral penicillin, with no resistance to fluoroquinolones observed. Among the staphylococci\n(231 S. aureus and 150 CoNS, respectively), resistance rates remained similar\nto 2016 rates, with considerable resistance against azithromycin (57% and 66%), oxacillin/methicillin\n(21% and 58%), and ciprofloxacin (21% and 27%).

In the cornea, this manifests as a reduction in corneal nerve fiber\ndensity. Up to 50% of patients with diabetes also experience dry eye disease. We hypothesize\nthat the reduced nerve fiber density contributes to the signs and symptoms of dry\neye disease. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between corneal\nnerve morphology and dry eye signs and symptoms in people with diabetes.\nMethods: Dry eye evaluation was performed on 13 participants (7 participants with diabetes\nand 6 control participants). Symptoms were assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease\nIndex questionnaire (OSDI). Signs were assessed with non-invasive keratograph tear\nbreakup time (NIKBUT, Oculus® Keratograph 5M, Wetzlar, Germany), tear film osmolarity\n(TearLab, San Diego, CA), phenol red thread test, lipid layer thickness (LipiView®,\nTearScience, Morrisville, N.C), corneal staining, conjunctival staining and the grade\nof lid wiper epitheliopathy. Corneal nerve morphology was assessed at the sub-basal\nnerve plexus using the Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph with the Rostock corneal module\n(Heidelberg, Germany) on one eye of each participant. Eight high-quality images were\ncaptured for each participant and underwent automatic segmentation and quantification\nusing ACCMetrics (University of Manchester, UK). The Mann-Whitney U test was used\nto compare the differences in parameters between groups. Spearman's rho correlation\nwas used to determine the relationship between variables. P values less than\n0.05 were considered significant. Data were calculated as mean ± standard deviation\nfor all variables.\nResults: Corneal nerve branch density and length were significantly reduced in the group with\ndiabetes, compared to the controls (19.2 ± 20.0 vs. 42.1 ± 19.2 branches/mm\n2\nrespectively, p = 0.04; and 10.3 ± 3.8 vs. 15.3 ± 3.5 mm/mm\n2\nrespectively,\np = 0.04). None of the signs or symptoms differed between groups. In the group\nwith diabetes, the only dry eye measure that correlated with corneal nerve morphology\nwas NIKBUT with corneal nerve branch density (r\ns\n= 0.79, p = 0.005).\nWithin the controls, the OSDI score was found to be inversely correlated with lipid\nlayer thickness (r\ns\n= -0.83, p = 0.04) and corneal staining (r\ns\n=\n-0.85, p = 0.03). The phenol red thread test showed a positive correlation\nwith osmolarity (r\ns\n= 0.98, p=0.005).\nConclusion: Corneal nerve morphology is positively correlated with NIKBUT in participants with\ndiabetes, while lipid layer thickness appears to correlate with the symptoms of dry\neye disease.","title":"Corneal Nerve Morphology and Dry Eye in People with Diabetes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185040\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The University of New South Wales\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kylie Sengmany, Kelly Xie, Debarun Dutta\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The University of New South Wales, The University of New South Wales, University of New South Wales\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Most notable here are\nsensory and visual ophthalmologic complaints. This purpose of the chart review is\ntwofold: first to catalogue the referral rate of symptomatic PD patients by neurology\nto ophthalmology, and second to discover the prevalence of ocular manifestations in\nthose patients with PD. The prevalence of dry eye and blepharitis symptoms, presence\nof cataracts, symptoms of double vision, depth perception and incidence of hallucinations.\nMethods: Retrospective chart review of 345 patients examined by Neurology at Northwell Health\n- a major hospital system in New York. Search criteria were those who had been diagnosed\nwith parkinson's disease within the network and presented with an Ophthalmological\ncomplaint within the last six years. We abstracted information including demographics,\nneurological history, clinical treatment of parkinsonism, ophthalmologic complains\nand subsequent ophthalmologic exam notes. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize\nthe population and the findings collated into graphs.\nResults: Of the 345 patients with PD and presenting with an ophthalmological complaint to their\nNeurologists, only 123 were sent for an ophthalmology referral. Of those examined\nin ophthalmology, nearly 62% had cataracts, either monocularly or binocularly, 38%\nwere pseudophakic, 90% had ocular discomfort, with 70% complaining of blurry vision.\nOver 80% had difficulty gauging depth, nearly 50% complaining of difficulty reading\nwith nearly a third complaining of frank diplopia and almost 7% with visual hallucinations.\nConclusion: The data show that only one third of ophthalmologically symptomatic patients were\nreferred by neurology to an ophthalmologist. The data does not show why this was the\ncase. As the percentage of patients symptomatic to anterior segment manifestations\nseems much higher than the established norms of patients in that same age group, it\nis possible that there is a greater prevalence of both dry eye and blepharitis in\nthese patients and so may skew towards the higher probabilities as reported in the\nliterature. However, many patients with various ophthalmologic symptoms received a\nproblem-focused instead of a full examination so true prevalence is not known. This\nunderscores two major points - one, to understand the referral strategies of neurologists\nin the presence of an ophthalmologic complaints - why do the ocular complaints of\nPD patients go unaddressed? Secondly, there is a need for a subsequent prospective\nlongitudinal study examining parkinsonian patients with ophthalmological complaints\nto catalogue true prevalence of ocular conditions with the longterm goal of merging\nthese two major points in creating a standard of care for approaching these patients.","title":"Retrospective Chart Review of Ophthalmologic Complaints of Patients with Parkinsons  Disease","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185041\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        MEETH Ophthalmology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Luke Schwartz\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        MEETH Ophthalmology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

It is\nwell known that the drug can cause optic nerve toxicity, visual impairment, and visual\nfield (VF) loss. VF defects are usually cecocentral and can be dense. Visual acuity\n(VA) is typically regained after stopping the drug; the amount and time frame is reliant\non the VA at the time of discontinuation. There is little data on long term follow\nup of these cases using multiple tests to direct clinicians on how to proceed once\nVA has stabilized. Here we present a case with years of follow up for a patient with\nMAC and ethambutol toxicity. A full battery of objective and subjective tests were\nperformed over time. These tests show how the condition progresses, even after VA\nbecomes normal.\n\nCase Report: 61 year old immunocompetent white male presented 2 weeks after discontinuing a 6 month\ncourse of ethambutol 400 mg daily for MAC. At the referring ophthalmologist's visit,\nthe optic nerves had a slight blurring of margins but there was no profuse leakage\nfrom the discs on fluorescein angiography. At our exam, he was 20/70 OD, 20/125 OS\nwith a cecocentral scotoma on 30-2 VF testing OD,OS. Multifocal electroretinogram\n(mfERG) and pattern ERG showed decreased amplitudes (amp). D-15 color testing showed\ntritan changes OS>OD. Contrast sensitivity was severely reduced to 0.8 CS. Optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) showed normal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses.\nThe visually evoked potential (VEP) was significantly reduced in amp and delayed,\nwith a P100 near 120 ms.\nOne year later the patient returned, with vision of 20/20\nOD, 20/30 OS. He also had cataract surgery between visits. The cecocentral scotomas\nhad resolved. The mfERG was normal. OCT RNFL demonstrated borderline thinning temporally\nOD,OS. The full field ERG had decreased scotopic and photopic amps. The VEP was improved\nin amp but was still delayed at 110-112 ms. Two years following the initial visit,\nthe patient was asymptomatic at 20/20 OD, 20/25 OS. The VF had mild non-specific points.\nD-15 showed moderate tritan defects OD,OS. The ERG showed improved scotopic responses.\nThe OCT showed worsening thinning of the temporal and central areas OD,OS with global\nRNFL thickness reduced 18 microns from baseline. The VEP was slightly improved but\nremained abnormal.\nConclusion: The OCT, VEP, and color vision results remain abnormal for this patient after more\nthan 2 years off the medication. The OCT becomes increasing thinned temporally and\ncentrally over time. It is not clear if this will begin to affect acuity again with\ntime. This indicates that the signs of toxicity remain for many years after discontinuing\nethambutol, even in the absence of patient symptoms with normal VA and VF. These patients\nshould be followed with objective tests in addition to subjective results.","title":"Long Term Complications Persist of Short Term Ethambutol Therapy in Immunocompetent  Individual with Mycobacterium Avium Complex Mulitmodal Image Analysis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185042\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Wendy Harrison\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Systemic\neffects of MPS are often still widespread and can involve respiratory and cardiac\ndysfunction along with skeletal abnormalities (broad, coarse facies and short stature),\nintellectual impairment, seizures and CNS decline. Shortened lifespan is common. Ocular\nsigns include corneal opacities in some MPS syndromes (though uncommon in MPS II)\nand optic nerve disorders including glaucoma and optic atrophy. Less common are retinal\npigmentary changes, which are thought to be a late manifestation. Here we demonstrate\nthe case of a patient with MPS II and a spectrum of structural and functional testing\nevaluating his pigmentary retinal degeneration.\n\nCase Report: A 21-year-old male was referred for electrodiagnostic consultation related to retinal\npigmentation. He was asymptomatic for blur, field loss or nyctalopia. Medical history\nwas positive for MPS II for which he received enzyme treatment, with secondary mitral\nvalve disease, cervical spine dysfunction, and mild hearing loss. Visual acuity was\n20/25 OD,OS. Fundus examination revealed mild pigmentary changes in the peripheral\nretinas. Visual fields (VF) showed dense constriction to the central 20 degrees. D15\ncolor was normal. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed loss of the inner segment/outer\nsegment junction (IS/OS) parafoveally. A ring-shaped fundus autofluorescence (AF)\npattern was seen, consisting of patchy paramacular hypo-AF with central hyper-AF within\nthe macula. ERG demonstrated nearly flat scotopic responses, and both a delay and\nreduction of a- and b-wave photopic amplitudes and oscillatory potentials.\nConclusion: This case highlights the pigmentary retinal changes and severely depressed ERG in\nan individual with MPS II. Results are remarkably similar to what would be expected\nin a retinitis pigmentosa or rod-cone dystrophy-like disorder. Although ocular and\nsystemic involvement often mirror each other, his ocular manifestations seemed to\noutpace systemic involvement, and the ERG response was considerably more striking\nthan the retinal appearance funduscopically. Besides short stature and facial appearance\ntypical of the condition, the systemic maladies were fairly mild. Though intellectual\nimpairment is possible in MPS, he had seemingly normal intelligence, and was completing\ncollege studies in engineering. A severely diminished ERG, constricted field, ring-shaped\nAF and loss of the IS/OS on OCT was evident even as he was completely asymptomatic,\nemphasizing the importance of close monitoring of those with this rare condition.","title":"Rodcone Dystrophylike Findings seen on Electroretinogram and Other Structural and  Functional Tests in Hunter Syndrome A Systemic Mucopolysaccharidosis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185043\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Upon initial examination, there was no reported pain, diplopia,\nor change in vision. The patient's ocular history included a stable choroidal nevus\nin the left eye and refractive error. The patient's medical history included hypertension,\nosteoarthritis, history of prostate cancer, and psoriasis, for which he was started\non Enbrel (etanercept) 4 months prior. Entrance testing revealed a mild restriction\nin upgaze of the right eye and anterior segment evaluation showed a soft, edematous\nsubcutaneous mass in the right medial canthus area. The palpable mass was approximately\n2cm in length en face and was not tender to touch. Dilated fundus examination was\nunremarkable with the exception of a stable choroidal nevus in the left eye. A CT\nscan with and without contrast was ordered and revealed avidly enhancing right superior\norbital homogenous soft tissue mass that is causing mild inferior displacement of\nthe globe. The oculoplastic specialist performed a biopsy which confirmed B-cell lymphoma\nof the orbit. Oncology performed a PET scan which showed no other systemic involvement\nand the cancer was staged as a stage 1E orbital lymphoma. Treatment with rituximab\n(anti CD20 antibody) infusions was initiated at this time. Concurrently, dermatology\nwas contacted regarding these findings and Enbrel treatment was held as it has been\nshown to be a causative agent for lymphoma. The patient was followed routinely with\noncology and oculoplastics throughout his treatment. CT scans of the orbits was repeated\nafter the fourth infusion and showed a 50% reduction in size of the soft tissue mass.\nAnother round of rituximab infusions were performed without complications, after which\nit was determined the orbital lymphoma was in remission. The patient was then monitored\nwith MRI of the orbits with and without contrast and is currently evaluated every\nsix months. During the course of treatment, evaluation with the oculoplastics specialist\nshowed gradual resolution of the palpable medial supraorbital mass and associated\nptosis. The patient returned to routine optometric care following treatment and was\nlast seen in early 2018 with stable exam findings.\nConclusion: Primary orbital lymphoma is a rare extra-nodal presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nEarly diagnosis and effective interdisciplinary care with oculoplastics specialist,\noncology, and dermatology are essential for a favorable outcome.","title":"Primary Orbital Lymphoma A Case Report","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185045\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Boston VA Healthcare System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Di Mattina\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Boston VA Healthcare System\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Excessive salt has been shown to cause tear hyperosmolarity and\ntrigger inflammation, leading to epithelial cell damage/death. Organic osmolytes,\nlike glycerin, L-carnitine, and erythritol, are considered beneficial replacements\nfor salt due to their ability to displace salt and protect cells against hyperosmotic\nstress (ie, osmoprotective effects). This study compared a series of marketed artificial\ntear products and their salt osmolality vs organic osmolytes to differentiate the\nosmotic agents included in the formulations.\nMethods: Total osmolality was measured directly by Freezing Point Depression (Advanced Instruments\nInc. Model 2020 Osmometer). Osmolality from the salts was estimated by measuring electrical\nconductivity (YSI 3200 Conductivity Meter). The portion of product osmolality due\nto organic osmolytes was calculated by subtracting the salt osmolality from the total\nosmolality. Ten marketed tear products were included in the study: the Allergan Optive\nfamily (Optive, Optive Gel Drops, and Optive Fusion), Allergan Refresh family (Refresh\nTears and Refresh Liquigel), Systane Ultra (Alcon), Clear Eyes PF Pure Relief (Prestige\nBrands), Advanced Vision Thera Tears (Akorn Consumer Health), Visine Tears (Johnson\n& Johnson), and Blink Tears (Abbott Medical Optics). All measurements were performed\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions for each instrument. All measurements\nwere repeated three times, and the average was used for data analysis.\nResults: Among the tested products, organic osmolytes ranged from 47 to 255 mOsm/kg, being\nhighest in the Optive family (247ˆ’255 mOsm/kg), due to the combination of beneficial\nglycerin, L-carnitine, and erythritol. Systane Ultra and Visine Tears were also in\nthe higher range of organic osmolytes at 187 and 159 mOsm/kg, respectively, due to\nthe presence of propylene glycol. In the remaining products, the osmotic balance was\ndue mostly to salt, with low organic osmolyte contents (ranging from 47 to 108 mOsm/kg).\nThe salt osmolality of the tested products varied from 64 to 175 mOsm/kg, with the\nlowest values in Blink tears (64 mOsm/kg) and the Optive family (ranging from 69 to\n84 mOsm/kg).\nConclusion: The two classes of osmotic agents evaluated herein play different roles in artificial\ntear formulations. Our findings verified that the osmotic balance of the Optive family\nis mainly composed of beneficial organic osmolytes, specifically osmoprotectants,\nand is low in salt.","title":"Osmotic Agents in Artificial Tears Organic Osmolytes vs Salts","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185026\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Allergan plc\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ashley Nguyen, Jaya Giyanani, Joseph Vehige\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Allergan plc, Allergan plc, Allergan plc\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Previous studies have evaluated the incidence of rebound inflammation\nwith Tri-Moxi-Vanc during cataract extraction (CE), however, there is limited published\nliterature regarding the rate of rebound inflammation with use of Tri-Moxi alone.\nMethods: A retrospective chart review was performed of 100 procedures at the Illinois Eye Institute\n(IEI) on patients between the ages of 52 - 90 years old undergoing cataract surgery\nwith an intravitreal injection of Tri-Moxi from January 5th, 2015 to August 31st,\n2017. A preoperative evaluation determined patient qualification for \"dropless\" CE. A single surgeon performed standard phacoemulsification CE and all patients received\na tranzonular injection of Tri-Moxi. Only patients not recieving pre-operative topical\nmedications of an NSAID or steroid were included. Post-operative examinations were\nheld appropriately 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month following CE.\nResults: Statistical analyses using the parametric method was performed to investigate the\ncorrelation between patient age during CE, race, gender, history of ocular inflammation,\nrate of rebound inflammation, days until onset of rebound inflammation, and pre-operative\nbest corrected visual acuity (BCVA). A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant. The rate of rebound inflammation was found to be 21%. In cases where\nrebound inflammation was diagnosed, onset was documented as early as 5 days and as\nlate as 114 days, with a median onset of 23 days post-CE. Past studies have suggested\na correlation of pigmentation and rebound inflammation, however, our study didn't\nfind a significant correlation between race and inflammation (chi-squared test, P\n= .886). There were significantly more cases of rebound inflammation in female patients\n(chi-squared test, P = .032), however, our sample size included 70 females. No statistical\ncorrelation was found between age and incidence of rebound iritis (chi-squared test,\nP = .863), nor between BCVA prior to CE (2-tailed test, P = .271).\nConclusion: The incidence of rebound iritis following CE combined with Tri-Moxi injection at IEI\nwas 21% which is a higher rate than previously reported in literature (10-13%). \"Dropless\"\nCE is cost-effective and more convenient than the current post-operative protocol\nof instilling drops for up to 30 days after CE. Tri-Moxi injections during CE should\nbe considered as an alternative to drops, however clinicians must be aware of the\npotential for rebound iritis.","title":"Incidence and Onset of Rebound Iritis Following Cataract Surgery in Patients Injected  with Triamcinolone Acetonide and Moxifloxacin HCL","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185027\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Agnieszka Krol, Julie Bhalla, Eleni Nouhakis, Eric Baas\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

A core mechanism of DED is an elevated\ntear film osmolarity (>308mOsm/L) and typically, management includes the use of\nartificial tears (AT). Consequently, it would be clinically useful to know the osmolality\nof AT, but companies are not always forthcoming with this information. The concentration\nof particles in AT are typically measured as osmolality (mmol/kg). Although conversion\ncharts exist to calculate osmolarity from osmolality and vice versa, for the purpose\nof tears, and small quantities of particles in AT, these values are interchangeable.\nBitton et al (2017) have previously reported the osmolality values of a majority of\nAT, however, since then, others have entered the market. This study analyzed the osmolality\nvalues of contemporary AT to supplement previous data in the literature.\nMethods: A vapor pressure osmometer (VAPRO 5520, Wescor) was used to measure the osmolality\nof ten contemporary AT available in Canada, namely hydraSense drops/advanced/gel (Bayer);\nHylo Fresh (Candorvision); Soothe (B+L), Optifree Pro (Alcon); Refresh Optive Gel\nDrops (Allergan); Dry Eye Relief (Similasan); Thealoz Duo (Thea); Systane Complete\n(Alcon). A 10 mL sample was measured (in mmol/kg) and repeated five times sequentially,\nwhile the order of the AT was randomized. The osmometer was calibrated prior to testing\neach AT.\nResults: The average osmolality of the AT (n=10) was 270.96 mmol/kg ± 3.07 SD. Seven AT were\nhypo-osmolar (<295) with an average of 253.11 ± 2.50 and three were hyper-osmolar\n(>308) with an average of 312.60 ± 4.39. The AT with the lowest mean osmolality\nwas Thealoz Duo (Thea) at 209.00 ± 1.58 and the AT with the highest mean osmolality\nwas hydraSense drops (Bayer) at 313.60 ± 2.07.\nConclusion: The majority of commercial AT reveal hypo-osmolality values. The osmolality of an\nAT may be an additional parameter to consider when ECPs choose management options\nfor their DED patients. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the therapeutic\neffectiveness in DED patients of hypo- versus hyper-osmolar AT.","title":"Osmolality Values of Contemporary Artificial Tears","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185028\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ecole d 'Optometrie, Universite de Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Alexandra Fortier, Etty Bitton\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ecole d 'Optometrie, Universite de Montreal, Ecole d 'Optometrie, Universite de Montreal\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Animal studies have suggested that cold\nreceptors show a decrease in activity in response to ocular allergy (Acosta et al.,\n2013), but there is little data in humans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate\nthe impact of seasonal ragweed allergies on cold thresholds and symptoms.\nMethods: Ten subjects (ages 21-26 years; 2 males and 8 females) with self-reported fall allergies\nto ragweed participated in the study. Following a screening visit, the first study\nvisit was in September of 2017 during the height of allergy season in our area. Subjects\nfilled out two questionnaires, the Eye Allergy Patient Impact Questionnaire (EAPIQ)\nand the Dry Eye Questionnaire (DEQ5) to assess habitual symptoms and then a custom\nmodified Belmonte Pneumatic Non-Contact Esthesiometer was used to measure corneal\nand conjunctival detection thresholds for cold stimuli, followed by magnitude estimates\nof intensity, coolness, irritation, and pain using a 1-100 scale. The procedures in\nthe second visit were identical and took place in November of 2017, outside of ragweed\nallergy season.\nResults: The median total symptom score measured by the EAPIQ during ragweed allergy season\nwas 20 versus 13 outside allergy season, which was a statistically significant difference\n(Wilcoxon rank sum, p=0.018). Individual symptoms of itchiness and dryness also were\nsignificantly higher during allergy season (p<0.04). The DEQ5 total score also\nshowed a significant difference in and outside allergy season (median score: 10 and\n6, respectively; p<0.01) with the individual symptoms of the intensity of dryness\nand watering significantly greater during allergy season. There was significant difference\nin cold thresholds between in and outside of allergy season (Repeated measures ANOVA,\ntime main effect, p=0.02), regardless of ocular surface location. Cold conjunctival\nthresholds were higher during allergy season (51.2±14.6 and 43.8±14.5, respectively).\nThere were significant interactions between ocular surface location (cornea versus\nconjunctiva) and in and out of allergy season for intensity and coolness ratings (both,\np=0.04) with conjunctival magnitude estimates rated lower during allergy season.\nConclusion: Not surprisingly, symptoms were higher during allergy season by an allergy-specific\nquestionnaire, the EAPIQ, but also by the DEQ5, which was designed for dry eye. In\naddition, the symptom of dryness was significantly higher in both questionnaires,\nsupporting the link between allergy and dry eye symptoms. The thresholds to cold stimuli\nwere increased during allergy season, suggesting desensitization to that stimulus\nduring that time.","title":"The Impact of Seasonal Allergies on Ocular Surface Cold Sensitivity and Symptoms","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185029\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carolyn Begley, Ping Situ, Flynt Davis, Deborah Antwi\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Some eye care practitioners (ECP) advocate refrigerating\nAT, however little evidence is available to support this recommendation and no difference\nin comfort has been demonstrated in mild to moderate DE patients (Bitton et al 2018).\nFurthermore, it has been reported (Belmonte et al 2017) that severe DE patients may\nreport pain and discomfort differently due to altered neural pathways. Hence the aim\nof this study was to determine if a change in temperature of an AT affects the sensation\nof comfort and pain upon its instillation in severe DE participants.\nMethods: A prospective, cross-over study with severe DE participants (OSDI >33, osmolarity\n>308mOsm/L) using an AT (Systane Ultra PF, Alcon) were asked to report, twice a\nday (AM and PM), their comfort and pain level prior to and following the instillation.\nThe AT was either refrigerated (rAT) or at ambient (aAT) temperature. Randomisation\nwas for the temperature of the AT, the laterality of instillation for the first week,\nand which eye was to receive the AT first. A cross-over occurred for the second week.\nResults: Eighteen (n=18, 11F:7M; age 29±6 yrs) severe DE participants (avg OSDI 51, range 38-71,\nosmolarity OD 315 ± 6.8, OS 315 ± 5.7mOsm/L) reported an improvement in comfort levels\npost instillation in both aAT (p<0.001) and rAT (p=0.008), but not for pain aAT\n(p=0.25) and rAT (p=0.12).

In addition, ratings of vision satisfaction increased from 49.0\n(30.9) at baseline to 64.8 (30.0) at 1 month, a 32% improvement from baseline (P <\n.001). No treatment-related AEs were reported.\nConclusion: Treatment of dry eye symptoms with a combination of an eye drop for day-time use and\na gel lubricant for evening use reduced overall dry eye symptoms, including comfort\nupon waking, and improved OSDI score.","title":"Patient Reported Outcomes of Dry Eye Disease using a Combined Treatment Regime of  Day and Nighttime Ocular Lubricants","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185032\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Allergan plc\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Shirlaw, Sameena Haque\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Allergan plc, Allergan plc\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

All participants\nprovided demographic information and completed the Visual Function Questionnaire-28\nrevised (VFQ-28-R) and the EuroQol-5-dimensions-5-levels (EQ-5D-5L). Scores for the\nVFQ-28-R questionnaire (Activity Limitations, Socio-emotional Functioning, Total Score)\nwere calculated for all participants. VFQ-28-R scores range from 0 to 100, with higher\nVFQ-28-R scores indicating better functioning. For EQ-5D-5L, percentage of participants\nendorsing each response option was reported. Those with DED also completed the eye\ndryness score (EDS), a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (no discomfort) to 100\n(maximal discomfort); and one half of the participants with DED also completed the\nImpact of Dry Eye on Everyday Life (IDEEL) questionnaire (higher scores on the IDEEL\nQOL module indicate better QOL).

Subjective and objective dry eye measurements were collected\non two separate days, the initial baseline measurement prior to the study and the\nfinal measurement at the conclusion of the study. At these visits, subjects completed\nthe SPEED questionnaire to analyze subjective symptoms. Osmolarity, tear film breakup\ntime, blood pressure, intraocular pressure, tear meniscus height, and tear lipid layer\nthickness were collected to analyze for objective signs of dry eye. Subjects were\nthen randomly assigned to two groups: a control group or a treatment group. Only the\ntreatment group was asked to increase water intake, the control group was asked to\nresume water intake patterns as per usual.\nResults: A total of 64 subjects presenting with severe subjective dry eye completed the study.\nAt the end of the study, 32% of treatment subjects were no longer classified as having\nsubjectively severe dry eye; whereas for the control group, only 6% dropped below\nthe severe category. Although ANCOVA found no significant effect of water intake on\nsubjective measurements, further analysis of the model differences divided by the\nroot mean square provided effect sizes shown to increase with increasing levels of\nbaseline SPEED (13-24) (Figure 1). As initial dry eye symptoms increased, final SPEED\nscore effect size between treatment and control became more significant. No trends\nbetween treatment groups were seen for other parameters.\nConclusion: In subjects with dry eyes, increased water intake resulted in no significant treatment\neffect for either subjective complaints or objective measures. However, further analysis\nof effect size implied that the impact of treatment subjectively was dependent on\ninitial severity and thus water intake may be clinically relevant for patients with\nmore severe dry-eye symptoms.

Flush tears were collected from both eyes and analyzed\nfor total protein content (TPC), substance P, matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9),\ntissue inhibitor of MMPs-1 (TIMP-1), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-6\n(IL-6). In vivo confocal microscopy was performed using the Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph\nIII with the Rostock Corneal Module on one eye on both occasions. Corneal dendritic\ncell density was treated as the main outcome variable measured. Corneal nerve morphology\nvariables measured were corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL), fiber density (CNFD), branch\ndensity (CNBD), fiber tortuosity (CNFT), fiber total branch density (CTBD), fiber\narea (CNFA), and fiber width (CNFW). For each corneal nerve variable, the average,\nstandard deviation and high and low values were analyzed.

As such, AM has significant clinical utility as a biological dressing\nfor a number of ophthalmic and soft tissue applications. Our lab has developed a sterile,\nshelf-stable AM tissue graft utilizing a novel supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO\n2\n)\nsterilization process in conjunction with lyophilization. To date, there are no commercially\navailable, drug-eluting ocular wound dressings; therefore, the purpose of the current\nstudy was to investigate the incorporation and release profile of ophthalmologically\nrelevant antibiotics in our AM graft product.\nMethods: Placentas were provided by the Cooperative Human Tissue Network. The AM was blunt\ndissected, rinsed in saline and placed on nitrocellulose paper, SCCO\n2\nsterilized\nand lyophilized (L-AM). L-AM and native AM were preloaded with commonly used ophthalmic\nbactericidals at predetermined concentrations and allowed to air dry followed by SCCO\n2\nsterilization and lyophilization. Antibiotic loading capacity and release was assessed\nfor each antibiotic by placing loaded AM in 1 mL PBS and taking aliquots at designated\ntime points. The UV-VIS absorbance specific for each antibiotic was measured and graphed\nover time. To determine bioactivity of eluted antibiotics post-SCCO\n2\nprocessing\nand lyophilization, the disk diffusion method was used and zone of inhibitions measured.\nResults: Amniotic membrane lyophilized prior to antibiotic loading (L-AM) demonstrated more\nthan a 2-fold uptake of antibiotics compared to native AM. Approximately 50% of loaded\nantibiotic was released from AM within the first five minutes and all concentrations\nof antibiotics tested displayed almost identical release profiles. Antibiotics continued\nto be released in decreasing concentrations over time out to four hours. The bioactivity\nof the loaded antibiotics was maintained after AM SCCO\n2\nprocessing and\nlyophilization.\n\nConclusion: Supercritical carbon dioxide sterilization processing of amniotic membrane followed\nby lyophilization maintains the bioactivity of loaded antibiotics to yield a sterile,\nshelf-stable ocular bandage. Our method of sterilization combined with lyophilization,\ncreates a tissue graft that can be used as a bandage or a scaffold for ocular therapeutic\napplications without the need for costly and limiting storage requirements. Here we\ndemonstrate the ability to preload sterile, lyophilized amniotic membrane with commonly\nused ophthalmic antibiotics. The incorporation of antibiotics into our shelf-stable\nAM ocular bandage adds additional therapeutic value to both military and civilian\npopulations.","title":"A Novel Amniotic Membrane Graft for the Treatment of Corneal Surface Injuries","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185017\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        United States Army Institute of Surgical Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        David Zamora, Anthony Johnson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        United States Army Institute of Surgical Research, United States Army Institute of Surgical Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The RAPID (Reducing Adenoviral Patient-Infected\nDays) study is a 2-year planning study to investigate key parameters for a definitive\nrandomized trial to assess the safety and efficacy of 5% povidone-iodine in treating\nAd-Cs. Timely and accurate diagnosis of Ad-Cs at presentation is crucial to the success\nof such a trial. Here, we report the predictive value of a commercial immunoassay\nfor Ad-Cs, using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay as the comparator. We also report\non the time-course for Ad-Cs resolution, as measured in terms of qPCR-derived viral\ntiter levels.\nMethods: A total of 168 participants, aged ? 18 years and presenting with \"pink eye\" of ? 4\ndays since symptom onset were screened for eligibility in 9 clinics through February,\n2018. The AdenoPlus„¢ (Quidel Corporation, San Diego CA) immunoassay was performed\nafter swabbing the participants' conjunctiva according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nAn additional conjunctival/tear sample was obtained with a flocked sterile swab, placed\nin Universal Viral Transport medium (BD, Franklin Lakes NJ) and then stored frozen\nat -80°C. The qPCR assays of these samples were later performed using adenovirus-specific\nprimer set and an Integrated Cycler (DiaSorin Molecular, Cypress CA). Participants\nwith a positive AdenoPlus were enrolled in the study and seen at five (1-2, 4-5, 7,\n14, 21 day) follow-up visits in which additional conjunctival swabs were obtained.\nResults: At screening, 52 of the 168 participants had a positive AdenoPlus result and were\nenrolled in the study. Subsequent qPCR analysis confirmed the presence of adenovirus\nin 26 of the 52 baseline samples collected from these participants, resulting in a\npositive predictive value of 50%. For the 116 samples collected from AdenoPlus-negative\nparticipants, 114 were qPCR-negative (negative predictive value = 98%). Assessments\nof conjunctival/tear samples during follow-up visits to 21 days from the 26 RPS+ and\nqPCR+ participants confirmed that qPCR was a responsive indicator of outcome. The\nnormalized viral titers (peak titers set at 100%) in all study participants decreased\nto 8.0% (±9.5 SD) at day 4-5 to 0.006% (±0.002) on day 14 visits and were undetectable\non day 21.\nConclusion: In a sample of 168 patients presenting with \"pink eye\", the AdenoPlus immunoassay\nexhibited a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 81%. Although the negative predictive\nvalue (98%) for this assay was higher than previously reported (71% to 95%), its positive\npredictive value (50%) was lower than that reported previously (63% to 94%), presenting\na challenge in its use as an eligibility criterion for clinical Ad-Cs trials. The\nqPCR assay can serve as an objective outcome measure of decreasing viral load over\ntime, which decreased by >99.99%, on average, by the 14-day follow-up visit.","title":"Predictive Value of FDAApproved Immunoassay for Adenoviral Conjunctivitis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185018\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Northeastern State University Oklahoma College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Hartwick, Tammy Than, Tim Bossie, Jennifer Harthan, Mathew Margolis, Mary Migneco, Christina Morettin, Christian Olson, Bojana Rodic-Polic, Crystal Rosemann, Ellen Shorter, Tave Van Zyl, Meredith Whiteside, Gregory Storch, Mae Gordon\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry, Carl Vinson VAMC, New England College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry, Washington University St. Louis, Washington University St. Louis, Illinois College of Optometry, Brooke Army Medical Center, DiaSorin Molecular, Brooke Army Medical Center, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, University of California, Washington University St. Louis, Washington University St. Louis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

As part of this study, we evaluated the tolerability of a\none-time treatment of preservative-free artificial tears (ATS) versus PVP-I 5% in\npatients with Ad-Cs.\nMethods: Eligibility included informed consent, age ?18, red eye with symptoms ?4 days, and\na positive AdenoPlus rapid immunoassay test for Ad-Cs. Participants were randomized\nto treatment with either 4-5 drops of ATS or PVP-I 5% after 1 drop of proparacaine\n0.5%. After 2 minutes, the ocular surface was lavaged with sterile saline irrigation\nsolution. Patients reported overall discomfort in the study eye from 0 (not at all\nbothersome) to 10 (very bothersome) before and immediately after treatment. Unmasked\nclinicians rated patient discomfort in the treated eye from 0 (no discomfort) to 10\n(very high discomfort) after treatment and clinicians rated corneal staining before,\nimmediately after and 1-2 days after treatment using the NEI fluorescein staining\nscale of 0 to 4 in five corneal zones.\nResults: There was a decrease in participant-rated discomfort before and after treatment in\nthe group receiving ATS (6.7 ± 2.6 to 3.3 ± 2.8; n=26; p<0.01). There was no difference\nin participant-rated discomfort before and after treatment in the group receiving\nPVP-I 5% (6.0 ± 3.0 to 6.2 ± 2.8; n=30; p= 0.7). Clinician-estimated post-treatment\ndiscomfort was 2.5 ± 2.7 in the ATS group compared to 5.6 ± 2.9 in the PVP-I 5% group.\nThere\nwas no change in corneal staining between pre-treatment, post-treatment day 0 or follow\nup day 1-2 in the group that received ATS, while those randomized to PVP-I 5% exhibited\na significant increase in corneal staining following treatment on day 0 that returned\nto pre-treatment levels by the first follow-up visit (Day 1-2, see accompanying Table).\nConclusion: Ophthalmic PVP-I 5% has been shown to be safe and tolerable through its use as a surgical\nscrub and prophylactic use before intra-ocular injections and procedures. However,\nanecdotal reports suggest that its perceived irritancy is a barrier to its use by\nclinicians in treating Ad-Cs. In this study, we did not find a change in participant-rated\nocular discomfort after treatment with ophthalmic PVP-I 5%. There was a reduction\nin participant-rated discomfort immediately after treatment with ATS. Although there\nwas a transient increase in corneal staining after treatment with PVP-I 5%, overall\ncorneal staining returned to pre-treatment levels by the day 1-2 visit. These findings\nsuggest that ophthalmic PVP-I 5% is well tolerated in patients with presumed adenoviral\nconjunctivitis.","title":"Reducing Adenoviral Patient Infected Days RAPID Tolerability of a Single InOffice  Use of Betadine for Acute Adenoviral Conjunctivitis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185019\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Meredith Whiteside, Jennifer Harthan, Andrew Hartwick, Julie Huecker, Mathew Margolis, Tim Bossie, Spencer Johnson, Mary Migneco, Christina Morettin, Tave Van Zyl, Mae Gordon, Tammy Than\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California, Illinois College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Washington University in Saint Louis, Washington University in Saint Louis, New England College of Optometry, Northeastern State University Oklahoma College of Optometry, Washington University in Saint Louis, Illinois College of Optometry, Harvard Medical School, Washington University in Saint Louis, University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

To date, there is limited information on the overall\ncosts of infectious conjunctivitis and on the direct costs associated with conjunctivitis\ntransmission from one family member (FM) to another. In this study, we aimed to quantify\nthe incremental direct all-cause medical costs due to conjunctivitis transmission\nwithin families.\nMethods: Optum Healthcare Solutions data (1/1/1998-6/30/2016) were used. The first FM to be\ndiagnosed with conjunctivitis was considered the seed patient (SP). Any FM who had\na conjunctivitis diagnosis within 28 days of the SP was considered \"infected\" by the SP. A conjunctivitis episode was defined as the 60-day period following a\nconjunctivitis diagnosis in an SP or an infected FM. The total cost of the conjunctivitis\nepisode was the sum of the all-cause costs for the primary episode (SP) and the secondary\nepisode (infected FMs). The impact of the number and rate of transmissions (time between\nSP and FM diagnoses) on episode cost was assessed using a generalized estimating equation\n(GEE) model adjusted for SP characteristics.\nResults: Distinct SPs (n=860,930) contributed 1,075,942 primary episodes. The unadjusted episode\ncost without transmissions due to the SP was $788.71 (95% CI: $785.22, $792.15). After\nadjusting for SP age, sex, region, insurance type, season and year of diagnosis, history\nof antibiotic resistance or previous conjunctivitis, and SP's use of conjunctivitis\nmedications at diagnosis, the cost increased with each infected FM ($466.99 [$358.46,\n$587.06]) and with greater transmission time (?1-7 days, $138.03 [$2.23, $259.14];\n>7 days, $193.96 [$67.83, $313.32]). A decrease in cost was associated with the\nSP receiving conjunctivitis medications on their diagnosis date (adjusted, -$42.26\n[-$48.86, -$35.18]).\nConclusion: Healthcare costs due to conjunctivitis increased with each FM infected or with increased\ntransmission time. Our results suggest that treatments that reduce the conjunctivitis\ntransmission likelihood and rate and that are administered promptly may decrease direct\nhealthcare costs for families.","title":"Direct Healthcare Costs of the Transmission of Infectious Conjunctivitis within Families  A US Claims Analysis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185021\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Shire Plc\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jay Pepose, Sujata Sarda, Wendy Cheng, Nora McCormick, Hoi Ching Cheung, Priyanka Bobbili, Mei Sheng Duh\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pepose Vision Institute, Shire Plc, Analysis Group, Inc., Analysis Group, Inc., Analysis Group, Inc., Analysis Group, Inc., Analysis Group, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Viscosity is a function of polymer size and concentration, which\nis relevant in dry eye disease. The overall osmolality of HA-based formulations is\nusually based on its sodium concentration, except in formulations that contain alternative\nnon-electrolytes (organic osmolytes) instead of sodium. This study was to compare\na NaCl free formulation with NaCl-containing formulations to investigate whether the\nviscosity of the artificial tear formulations is directly affected by sodium concentration,\nwhich in turn may influence comfort and residence time and thus clinical performance.\nMethods: A marketed NaCl free artificial tear formulation containing HA, carboxymethylcellulose,\nand the non-electrolyte organic osmolytes glycerin, L-carnitine, and erythritol in\na lactate buffer (Optive Fusion UD, Allergan plc) was modified by (1) substituting\nthe organic osmolytes with NaCl 0.55% (w/w) or (2) keeping the organic osmolytes and\nadding NaCl 0.7% (w/w) to the formulation. Total osmolality of the original and modified\nformulations was determined using a standard freezing point depression osmometer (Model\n2020, Advanced Instruments). Rheological performance was measured on a research rheometer\n(Model DHR-3, TA Instruments) at 35°C, using a flow procedure while varying the shear\nrate range from 1/s to 10,000/s.\nResults: All 3 formulations exhibited characteristic shear-thinning of HA-based artificial\ntears in general. Substituting the organic osmolytes with NaCl 0.55% (w/w) maintained\ntotal osmolality at 286 mOsm/kg but reduced the measured viscosity at all shear rates\n(Figure), ranging from a 20% reduction at low shear rate (1/sec) to a 10% reduction\nat high shear rate (10,000/sec). Addition of NaCl 0.7% (w/w) increased total osmolality\nto >500 mOsm/kg and decreased the measured viscosity at all shear rates, ranging\nfrom a 30% reduction at low shear rate (1/s) to a 14% reduction at high shear rate\n(10,000/s). These findings show an overall viscosity loss and decreased shear thinning\nproperties in the presence of added NaCl.\nConclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the presence of NaCl, either by adding additional NaCl,\nor substituting organic osmolytes with NaCl, significantly impacted the viscosity\nand rheology of this NaCl free, HA-containing artificial tear. By avoiding NaCl, viscosity\nand shear thinning properties are both optimized, giving the potential benefits of\nreduced blurred vision, while improving retention time, hydration, lubrication, and\nduration of comfort for patients with dry eye. Furthermore, because excess salt in\nthe tear film can lead to upregulation of inflammation and ocular surface damage,\nas well as symptoms of discomfort, a lower sodium concentration may be additionally\nadvantageous in artificial tear formulations.","title":"Hyaluronic Acidbased Artificial Tears Effects of Sodium on Their Viscosity and Other  Rheological Properties","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185022\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Allergan plc\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Richard Meller, Joseph Vehige, Hongpeng Wang, Peter Simmons\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Allergan plc, Allergan plc, Allergan plc, PCS Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The use of Î±1-AR agonists\n(eg phenylephrine and tetrahydrozoline) or mixed Î±1/Î±2-AR agonists (eg naphazoline)\nhas been associated with tachyphylaxis (tolerance or loss of effectiveness due Î±1-AR\ndownregulation with continued use). In contrast, brimonidine has been shown to affect\nvasoconstriction primarily via the Î±2-AR subtypes and may therefore have decreased\npotential for tachyphylaxis. Low-dose brimonidine ophthalmic solution 0.025% was recently\napproved for relief of ocular redness due to minor irritations. We evaluated redness\nrelief over time and the potential for tachyphylaxis to low-dose brimonidine across\ntwo pivotal clinical studies evaluating its safety and efficacy for the relief of\nocular redness.\nMethods: Data were pooled from two randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical studies.

A lower\ndose (0.38%) LE gel with smaller (nanometer range) drug particles (submicron LE gel)\nhas been shown to have improved penetration into anterior ocular tissues. Thus, it\nmay be possible to reduce dosing frequency of submicron LE gel vs. LE gel 0.5%. Lower\ndosing frequency is expected to enhance patient convenience and potentially improve\ndosing compliance. This pooled analysis of two Phase 3 trials evaluated submicron\nLE gel 0.38% dosed TID in resolving inflammation and pain post-cataract surgery.\nMethods: This was an integrated analysis of the vehicle and TID-dosing arms of two multicenter,\nrandomized, double-masked studies in subjects undergoing phacoemulsification cataract\nsurgery. Subjects in each study were treated with LE gel 0.38% TID or vehicle (BID\nor TID, pooled for analysis) for 14 days. Efficacy assessments included anterior chamber\n(AC) cells, AC flare (both on a 0-4 scale), and pain (on a 0-5 scale) on postoperative\ndays 3, 8, 15, and 18. The hierarchical primary outcomes were the proportion of subjects\nwith complete resolution of AC cells and pain on postoperative day 8. Secondary outcomes\nincluded proportion of subjects with complete resolution of AC cells, AC flare, and\npain at each visit and proportion of subjects requiring rescue medication during the\npostoperative period. Safety/tolerability outcomes included adverse events, intraocular\npressure (IOP), ocular signs and symptoms, and drop sensation.\nResults: There were 371 subjects each treated with LE gel 0.38% TID and with vehicle in the\nintegrated ITT population. A greater proportion of subjects in the LE gel 0.38% group\nvs. vehicle group had complete resolution of AC cells (29.6% [110/371] vs. 15.1% [56/371]),\nand pain (74.4% [276/371] vs. 48.8% [181/371]) at postoperative day 8 (P<0.0001\nfor both). In addition, significant treatment differences were found in favor of LE\ngel TID at days 15 and 18 for AC cells, days 3, 15, and 18 for pain and at all visits\nfor AC flare (P<0.003 for all). The proportion of subjects requiring rescue\nmedication was lower in the LE gel 0.38% group vs. vehicle group through day 18 (18.4%\nvs. 39.2%; P<0.0001). Study eye AEs were infrequent and mostly mild/moderate\nin severity. One patient in the LE gel 0.38% TID group experienced an IOP elevation\n?10 mm Hg.

Comparisons between eyes were made with an unpaired t-test.\nResults: 422 individuals with keratoconus completed the survey. 272 individuals reported no\nhistory of ocular surgery for keratoconus in either eye (age: 46 ± 14 years [mean\n± SD], range 15-82; n=263). 147 individuals (age: 49 ± 16, range 15-87; n=144) reported\nsurgery for keratoconus in one (n=77; Age: 49 ± 15; range 15-87, n =75) or both eyes\n(n=70; Age 48 ± 17; range 17-74, n=69).

Slit lamp evaluation revealed\nsuperficial punctate keratitis, blepharitis, chelazia, and corneal neovascularization.\nVision was reduced to 20/30 secondary to an irregular corneal surface. Meibography\nby Lipiscan showed diffuse atrophy of meibomian glands. Treatment with antibiotics\nand steroids improved signs and symptoms, but only temporarily. Instead, two treatments\nwith Lipiflow demonstrated positive meibomian gland stimulation by a 0.3 PSI meibomian\ngland evaluator, and improvement in comfort.\nConclusion: The improved quality of life that dupilumab offers is diminished by the medication's\nocular side effects.

Visual acuities were count fingers at 6 feet and\n20/400 respectively. Biomicroscopy revealed significant corneal stromal edema and\nbullae. Anterior Segment OCT (AS-OCT) revealed corneal thickness of 1056 microns and\n906 microns, respectively. Both patients were instructed to discontinue contact lens\nwear temporarily and treated with a topical hypertonic sodium chloride agent and concurrent\ntopical corticosteroid therapy.

Both patients resolved in less than 2 months without\nvisually significant scarring or corneal neovascularization.\nConclusion: Corneal hydrops is a rare complication of keratoconus and other corneal ectasias,\nwhich occurs when Descemet's membrane and the endothelium splits, allowing fluid to\nenter the stroma. The prevalence of corneal hydrops is estimated to be between 2.6%\nand 2.8% of keratoconic patients. In the majority of cases, acute corneal hydrops\nresolves over 2-4 months. However many patients are left with visually debilitating\ncorneal scarring and neovascularization. While corneal hydrops is not considered a\ntrue inflammatory condition, topical corticosteroids may be prescribed in addition\nto other topical therapies to reduce healing time, improve overall visual outcome\nand avoid surgical intervention.","title":"Topical Corticosteroids Used to Hasten Healing Time and Prevent Corneal Neovascularization  in Acute Hydrops","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185007\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Anisha Patel\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Nova Southeastern University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Although hydrops are\na self-limiting condition, patients typically present in a significant amount of pain\nand with vision loss, furthermore, the risk of perforation in severe keratocones is\nconcerning. Additionally, corneal neovascularization and scarring can be substantial\nwhen treatment is withheld or delayed. Due to these morbidities, the presentation\nrequires that clinicians are able to correctly diagnose the severity and provide adjunctive\ntherapy in a timely manner. This case outlines how the anterior segment OCT was an\nexcellent tool to rule out corneal perforation in a severe case of corneal hydrops\nand monitor the condition for resolution and corneal scarring. The various treatment\noptions will also be reviewed in the report.\n\nCase Report: A 30 year old African American male presented to the emergency service with the chief\ncomplaint of sudden ocular pain and tearing in the left eye for the past 3 days. Upon\nclinical evaluation he was diagnosed with acute corneal hydrops in the left eye. On\nslit lamp evaluation there was one area of elevation with a clear zone around it that\nwas suspicious for a perforation. Anterior Segment OCT (AS-OCT) was done to better\nassess the area. The imaging revealed a mucous plug, which was removed with a cotton\ntip applicator and an intact cornea was noted. The patient was started on Moxeza 0.5%\nQID OD, Muro 128 5% ung QID OD and Atropine 1% BID and referred for consult to a corneal\nspecialist, James Lewis M.D. the next day. Dr. Lewis agreed with the diagnosis and\ntreatment and referred the patient back for medical management. The patient was treated\nand followed for resolution with serial AS-OCT over the course of 3 months. The AS-OCT\nhelped determine when to increase/taper some of the topical therapy. The AS-OCT also\ncaptured the development of mild anterior corneal scarring which actually helped improve\nhis vision by effectively flattening the corneal surface. Before the incident his\nvision was Finger Counting with no improvement with pinhole; it improved to 20/100\nafter the hydrops resolved.\nConclusion: Hydrops are not a medical emergency but do require prompt diagnosis and proper management\ndue to relatively high morbidity of the condition. AS-OCT can be very helpful in assessing\nperforation risk. Additionally AS-OCT can help monitor the condition for anterior\nscarring and resolution effectively helping us determine when to increase or taper\ntopical therapy. This is a condition that we as optometrist are well equipped to treat\nbut in severe cases co-management with a corneal specialist is advantageous","title":"Anterior Segment OCT For The Management Of Acute Corneal Hydrops In A 33 Year Old  African American Male","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185008\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Salus University - Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Kriti Bhagat\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects were asked about the presence of current ocular discomfort, and MG\nassessments were performed. Assessments on the upper and lower eyelids included gland\nexpressibility score (0=minimal pressure to express meibum to 3=heavy pressure), number\nof non-expressible glands, and meibum quality score. Meibography images were obtained\nusing the Keratograph 5M (Oculus, Inc.). A MG score was determined by grading the\narea of dropout from 0 to 4 (0=no dropout, 1=<25% dropout, 2=25-50% dropout, 3=51-75%\ndropout, and 4=>75% dropout). Subjects were categorized into Group 1 if ocular\ndiscomfort was present and Group 2 if asymptomatic. Non-parametric statistical tests\nand Spearman correlation were used; median (M, range) values are reported.\nResults: Meibography images on the upper and lower right eyelids were obtained on 205 subjects;\n15.6% (n=32) reported having ocular discomfort at the visit with \"˜itching' as the\nmost common symptom (34.4%). There were no significant differences in age between\nGroup 1 (n=32, µ=12, SD=3.1 years) and Group 2 (n=173, µ=12, SD=2.7 years) (p=0.90).\nWhen analyzing MG scores, 38% in Group 1 and 39% in Group 2 had a MG score of zero\nin either the upper or lower eyelid but not both. Upper eyelid MG score (M=0.5, 0-2)\nwas not significantly correlated with lower eyelid MG score (M=0.5, 0-3) in Group\n1 (r=0.3, p=0.13), but upper (M=0, 0-3) and lower (M=0, 0-4) MG scores were significantly\ncorrelated in Group 2 (r=0.2, p<0.01) which indicates symptomatic subjects were\nmore likely to have differences between eyelids.

The significance of glandular\ntortuosity is poorly understood and remains to be fully characterized. Baseline data\nfrom a longitudinal, non-interventional study were analyzed to assess clinical relationships\nto meibomian gland tortuosity.\nMethods: Students enrolled in the professional program at the UAB School of Optometry were\nrecruited and surveyed regarding dry eye symptoms (SANDE, SPEED), digital device use,\nand contact lens wear. All subjects underwent a comprehensive dry eye examination\nincluding meibography with the LipiView II (TearScience, Morrisville, NC). Gland tortuosity\nfor all lids was evaluated by one clinician. Tortuosity absence was defined as glands\npresenting with parallel and linear structure; tortuosity presence was defined as\nglands with non-parallel and/or overlapping orientation. Spearman's correlation coefficient\nwas used to correlate tortuosity to symptom score, device use, and contact lens wear\n(SAS v9.4, Cary, NC).\nResults: There were 147 subjects (age 24.3 ± 2.2, 73.5% female) recruited. Subjects reported\n7.8 ± 2.9 hours of daily electronic device use, and 46.4% (n=68) reported ocular discomfort\nwhile using these devices. SANDE frequency scores varied from 0 to 91 (mean 27.7 ±\n22.2) and severity scores from 0 to 68 (mean 26.0 ± 18.4). SPEED scores varied from\n0 to 18 (mean 6.2 ± 4.3). Meibomian gland tortuosity demonstrated poor vertical symmetry\nbetween the upper and lower lids but good lateral symmetry between the right and left\nsides. Upper lid tortuosity (78.2% for RUL, 80.3% for LUL) was more common than lower\nlid tortuosity (43.6% for RLL, 44.9% LLL). There was no correlation between SANDE\nfrequency, SANDE severity, or SPEED scores with upper or lower gland tortuosity (rho<0.07\nfor all, p > 0.11 for all). In this narrow age range, there was also no correlation\nbetween age (rho<0.14, p > 0.10) or number of daily hours of device use (rho<0.11,\np > 0.20) with upper or lower tortuosity. However, there was a significant negative\ncorrelation between total duration of soft contact lens wear with tortuosity of the\nRLL (rho=-0.24, p=0.02) and LLL (rho=-0.24, p=0.02). There was no correlation with\nupper lid tortuosity.\nConclusion: Young adults in a demanding academic environment spend approximately half of normal\nwaking hours using electronic devices, and nearly half report ocular discomfort while\ndoing so. This behavior and its corresponding dry eye symptoms, however, did not correlate\nwith meibomian gland tortuosity in this study. Gland tortuosity may be related to\nan ocular surface condition other than dry eye, could be a variant of normal anatomy,\nor may be a sign of emerging ocular surface disease.

While the impact of CL wear on the meibum composition is unclear,\nthe main polar lipid in the meibum, OAHFA, has been indicated as a potential biomarker\nfor these changes. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the profile\nof OAHFA molecular lipid species in the meibum of contact lens wearers with different\ndurations of exposure to CL wear as well as previous CL wearers.\nMethods: This was a cross sectional study of 100 individuals with different exposures to CL\nwear. These were divided equally into 5 groups: short, moderate and long experience\nof CL wear, previous CL wearers (PWs), and healthy non- wearers (NWs) as controls.\nThe meibum samples were collected by using a metal spatula after expressing the lower\neyelid with the meibomian gland evaluator. The meibum sample was dissolved in 525\nÎ¼l methanol:chloroform (1:2) in a glass vial directly after collection, and stored\nin a -80° C freezer until analyzed. A 50 Î¼L volume of extract was analysed with a\nQ-Exactive Plus Mass Spectrometer coupled to a U3000 UPLC system using a shotgun approach.\nPeak area normalization was conducted to quantify species (% area). The individual\nOAHFAs were further investigated and reported as average area percentage (%) of total\nOAHFAs. The relative % area of each species was then statistically compared between\nthe five groups using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni testing\npost-hoc, where appropriate.\nResults: OAHFAs represented the major component of the polar lipids detected in all samples.\nThe relative total %area for OAHFA reduced slightly and progressively with increasing\nCL wear duration, but this was not statistically significant (ANOVA p= 0.78 ). At\na species level, 19 different molecular lipid OAHFAs were detected, predominantly\nthose containing 18:1/30:1, and 18:1/32:1.

The reduction of glutathione decreases antioxidant capacities for cells\nto remove radical oxygen species (ROS). As ROS builds up, cellular organelles and\nmachinery are damaged and viability is decreased. The purpose of this study is to\ndetermine the effect of BSO on the viability of human meibomian gland epithelial cells\n(HMGEC, Schepens Eye Research Institute of Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, MA)\nover a course of 24 hours.\nMethods: HMGEC were grown to confluence in T75 flasks in keratinocyte-free serum media (KSFM)\nsupplemented with 5ng of epithelial growth factor (EGF) and 2mL of 50 µg/mL bovine\npituitary extract (BPE). The cells were seeded into two 12-well plates (Plates A and\nB) at a density of 54800 cells per well, and were grown to confluence in the same\nmedia (KSFM+EGF+BPE). Each 12-well plate is a matrix of 3 rows Ã— 4 wells, which allowed\nfor three technical replicates of four experimental oxidative stress concentrations.\nThe experimental BSO concentrations tested in triplicate were 0 µM, 50 µM, 5 µM, and\n0.5 µM. The BSO media was formulated by dissolving 10 mg BSO into 50 mL of Dulbecco's\nModified Eagle Medium (DMEM/F12 1:1) supplemented with 10 µg/mL EGF and 10% fetal\nbovine serum, and then diluting as required to produce three BSO media solutions with\nconcentrations of 0.5 µM, 5 µM, and 50 µM. After loading 1mL of BSO media to each\nwell, both plates were incubated at 37°C and cell viability was measured using a methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium\nassay at t=0 hrs (Plate A, no exposure to BSO media) and t=24 hrs (Plate B). A one-way\nANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used to test the difference in viability\nbetween the different concentrations for each plate.\nResults: At t=0 hrs, mean±SD viability relative to the control (0 µM) were 133% ± 21%, 117%\n± 20%, and 120% ± 35% for 0.5 µM, 5 µM, and 50 µM BSO, respectively, all of which\nwere not significantly different from the control (all p?0.26), and not significantly\ndifferent from each other (all p?0.36).

Seventy-two eyes of 36 patients (n=27\nfemales and 9 males) were used for structural analysis. LLT and blinking data were\navailable for 38 eyes of 19 patients (n=11 females and 3 males).\nResults: Eighty-six percent of our population exhibited partial blinking with the average percentage\nof PB per patient being 39% (std dev = 34.4 and range of 0 to 100%). The average LLT\nwas 60.6 nm (std dev = 19.5 and range of 30 to 100 nm) and 60.5% of the children had\nLLT between 31 nm and 60 nm. The average percentage of dilated glands per eye was\n30.2% (std dev = 24.3 and range of 0 to 100%), and 93.1% of the population exhibited\ngland dilation.

Computer-based neurocognitive tests are often utilized\nby sports medicine physicians in their evaluation of potential concussions in adolescents.\nAs these tests are administered at a near working distance and likely induce significant\nvisual demand, the presence of symptomatic BV disorders may complicate neurocognitive\nassessments of these individuals. The objective of this study was to determine the\neffect of binocular vision symptoms (BVS) on adolescents' scores on the CogState Brief\nBattery, a computerized neurocognitive test commonly used in the assessment of sports-related\nconcussion (SRC).\nMethods: 53 subjects (34 concussion, 19 control) aged 9 ? 17 years were administered the CogState\nBrief Battery, which consists of four modules assessing the areas of Processing, Attention,\nLearning and Working Memory. All subjects received a sensorimotor evaluation and were\nadministered the Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey (CISS) to quantify severity\nof vision-related symptoms. Comparisons of the CogState scores were made between the\ngroups with and without concussion and between the groups with CISS score ? 16 (BVS)\nand < 16. The influence of concussion and BVS on the CogState test scores was analyzed\nusing ANCOVA statistical testing.\nResults: Mean days since injury in subjects with SRC was 9.5 (± 6.5). 59% of the SRC group\nand 37% of controls had a CISS symptom score ? 16, and all subjects with scores above\nthis cutoff were confirmed to have a BV disorder based on the results of the sensorimotor\nexam. The scores for the Processing and Attention components of the CogState were\nsignificantly (P=0.027 and P=0.039, respectively) lower in the SRC group\ncompared to controls. Within the SRC group, the scores for the Attention (P=.039)\nand Working Memory (P=.043) components were significantly lower in those with\nBVS compared to without. In contrast, the presence of BVS did not significantly affect\nthe scores on any component of the CogState in the control group. Individuals with\nSRC and BVS scored lower on Processing (P=.046) and Attention (P=.017)\nas compared to controls with BVS.\nConclusion: BVS, as assessed with the CISS, are prevalent in adolescents with SRC. The presence\nof BVS alone does not significantly influence scores on the CogState Brief Battery.\nHowever, the presence of BVS in individuals with SRC is associated with significantly\nreduced scores in Attention and Working Memory, indicating that the combination of\nSRC and BVS has an interaction effect on neurocognitive test scores. Processing and\nAttention appear to be impacted most by a SRC among those with BVS.

Oculomotor assessments such as the DEM and King Devick tests are sideline\ntools used to screen for concussion and determine return-to-play immediately following\ninjury. The etiology of deficits on these tests is unknown. We hypothesize that accommodative\nand vergence dysfunction contribute to abnormal performance on this testing following\nconcussion.\nMethods: A retrospective, non-randomized, single-center consecutive case series study was conducted\nof a multidisciplinary concussion clinic at Boston Children's Hospital over a period\nof four years. Inclusion criteria were all patients who had accommodation (amplitude,\nfacility and accuracy), vergence (near point, ranges and facility) and visual tracking\n(DEM vertical time, horizontal time and error scores) evaluated during their clinical\nexaminations. Exclusion included incomplete testing, amblyopia, strabismus, or other\neye abnormality noted on examination. Multiple linear regression models were developed\nto understand the effects of accommodation and vergence findings on DEM scores.\nResults: Chart review yielded 100 patients who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 15 years\nold (61% female). The majority of patients (52%) had their first lifetime concussion\nand most were sports-related (44%). The clinical data showed quantifiable accommodation\nand vergence deficits in over 90% of patients. A receded near point of convergence\n(NPC) and reduced accommodative amplitudes (AA) were the most common vergence (65%)\nand accommodative deficits (59%), respectively. Both NPC and AA predicted performance\n(measured in time) on vertical DEM (P <0.001, P< 0.001), and AA predicted performance\non horizontal DEM (P =0.005). A multiple linear regression model including accommodative\nand vergence measures revealed vergence facility as the only individual significant\npredictor for horizontal DEM time (P = 0.005), and vergence facility and AA as significant\npredictors of vertical DEM time (P = 0.01, P = 0.001).\nConclusion: Post-concussion patients show a multitude of visual deficits. DEM and King Devick\ntesting is used as sideline screening for concussion. Our results are the first to\nshow that vergence facility and accommodative amplitude drive deficits in DEM testing\npost-concussion. Knowledge of these quantifiable accommodative, vergence, and visual\ntracking deficits may guide further study into the underlying pathophysiology of visual\ndeficits post-concussion and may improve management strategies for post-concussion\npatients.","title":"Accommodation and Vergence Deficits Predict Performance on the Developmental  Eye Movement Test in Adolescent Postconcussion Patients","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180130\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Boston Children's Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ankoor Shah, Aparna Raghuram\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Minimum\npupil size, time to maximum constriction and the 6 s post illumination pupil response\n(PIPR) were calculated; (2) Flicker protocol: 0.1 Hz flicker with LW (33 cd/m\n2\n)\nand 0.1 Hz flicker with SW stimuli (16 cd/m\n2\n), were presented for 2 minutes\neach. Minimum pupil size and peak velocity of constriction and re-dilation were calculated.\n\nResults: Baseline dark adapted pupil diameter was smaller in TBI subjects compared to control\nsubjects (normal: 5.83 ± 1.1 mm; TBI: 5.26 ± 2.4 mm, P = 0.01). For the increasing\nintensity protocol, time to maximum constriction was significantly shorter in TBI\nsubjects for the LW (normal 1.39 ± 0.15 s vs. TBI 1.30 ± 0.19 s, P = 0.02) and 4 of\n10 SW intensities (p < 0.01). The relative minimum pupil size (with respect to\nbaseline) and the 6 s PIPR were not significantly different for LW or SW stimuli (P\n> 0.05). However, raw pupil diameters (in mm) were significantly smaller for TBI\nsubjects for LW and all except the 2 highest intensity SW stimuli (p < 0.05).

The time to reach the peak velocity\nwas significantly longer in TBI subjects during both the constriction and re-dilation\nphases for LW and SW stimuli (p < 0.05). In addition, the raw maximum pupil diameter\n(mm) during the re-dilation phase was larger in TBI subjects (p < 0.05) in LW and\nSW stimuli.\n\nConclusion: The significant differences observed in TBI subjects (relative to control subjects)\nin response to LW and SW stimuli suggest that pupil responses are altered via rod/cone\nand ipRGC pathways, respectively.

Diagnostic tools\nfor this debilitating condition are lacking and rarely employed. This study sought\nto determine whether observers can identify photophobic signs in masked videos of\neyes during light stimulation that were recorded from subjects with TBI-associated\nphotophobia.\nMethods: Cohorts of healthy students (n = 20), TBI subjects with self-reported photophobia\n(n = 28) and their age- and gender-matched control subjects (n = 12) were recruited.\nA custom pupillometer delivered bright (10\n13\n-10\n14\nphot/s/cm\n2\n),\nflashing (0.1 Hz for 2 min) red (625 nm) and blue (470 nm) lights to all subjects.\nConsensual pupil light responses were recorded, and their temporal dynamics were quantified\nwith fast Fourier transforms. Using a five-point scale, five clinical observers graded\nlight aversion behavior in the pupil recordings obtained from the student group based\non observed blinking, tearing and squinting. A standardized, five-point grading scale\nwas developed and used to grade the perceived light aversion in masked pupil recordings\nobtained from subjects with post-TBI photophobia and their control subjects. Case\nand control subjects also scored their perceived discomfort during each light pulse\nwith a five-point scale.\nResults: In the students, the amplitude of pupil fluctuation was greater (p < 0.001, t-test)\nin response to the red light (mean ± SD: 22.7 ± 4.04%) than the blue light (15.4 ±\n3.82%), consistent with the activation of ganglion cell photoreceptors by the blue\nlight. Observers judged this group to be more (P = 0.007, Wilcoxon signed rank test)\nlight-aversive to the blue light (grade: 2.8 ± 1.1) than the red light (2.5 ± 1.3)\nwith good inter-observer consistency (r = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.63-0.84]). Case subjects\nreported both the blue (4.0 ± 0.72) and red (3.7 ± 0.93) flashing lights to be more\nuncomfortable (blue p < 0.001, red P = 0.017; Mann-Whitney rank sum test) than\ntheir control subjects (blue 2.6 ± 0.80, red 2.9 ± 0.78). This difference was not\nreflected in the grades of light aversion behavior by the masked observers using the\nstandardized grading scale, as the mean grades for the videos obtained from the blue\n(cases 2.8 ± 1.2, controls 2.6 ± 1.4; P = 0.37, Mann-Whitney) and red (cases 2.3 ±\n1.1, controls 2.5 ± 1.1; P = 0.36) recordings did not differ between the case and\ncontrol subjects. Inter-observer consistency remained high (r = 0.78 [0.67-0.84])\nwith the new scale, and an inter-observer concordance value of 29% suggested that\nthe scale had acceptable sensitivity to detect behavioral differences between the\ntwo groups.\nConclusion: We did not find evidence to support the premise that clinicians can reliably diagnose\nTBI-related photophobia based solely on video recordings of ocular stimulation in\ndark-adapted individuals. The need remains for an objective test to detect and follow\nthis common yet unelucidated post-TBI symptom.","title":"ObserverPerceived Light Aversion Behavior in Photophobic Subjects with TBI","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180132\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Patrick Shorter, Catherine McDaniel, Michael Earley, Andrew Hartwick\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Air Force Research Laboratory, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry, Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

The cortical processing of visual information involves two parallel streams;\nthe ventral stream (form perception) and the dorsal stream (motion perception). Our\npurpose was to assess whether processing in the dorsal and/or ventral stream is affected\nby mild TBI. A range of basic visual functions were also assessed and we investigated\nthe association between each vision measure and Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory\nPCSI scores.\nMethods: Eleven adults with mild TBI (mean age 25.5, range 19-42 years; 17 ± 5.2 months post-injury),\nand 25 controls (mean age 27.9, range: 19-38 years) participated. Global processing\nof form and motion was assessed psychophysically using Glass patterns and random dot\nkinematograms (RDK) respectively. Contrast thresholds for fully coherent RDK motion\ndirection discrimination were also measured. Contrast sensitivity (Freiburg test),\nstereo acuity, near point of convergence, accommodative facility and amplitude, negative\nand positive fusional vergence and vergence facility were also measured. Mild TBI\nsymptoms were assessed using the PCSI scores.\nResults: Patients with mild TBI demonstrated higher (worse) global form (mean ±SD: 25.1 ± 5.9%)\nand motion coherence (14.4 ± 6.7%) thresholds than controls (global form 21.2 ± 5.4%;\nglobal motion (10.8 ± 3.4) (p=0.01). The magnitude of the processing deficit did not\ndiffer significantly between the global form and motion tasks (p > 0.05). Contrast\nthresholds for motion discrimination did not differ significantly between groups,\nbut there was greater between-subject variability in the mild TBI group (1.13 ± 0.5)\nversus controls (1.20 ± 0.3). There was a significant correlation between contrast\nthresholds for motion discrimination and PCSI score (R\n2\n= 0.51. p=0.01)\nin the mild TBI group. PCSI scores were not significantly correlated with global form\nor motion coherence thresholds. As expected, the mild TBI group were worse than controls\nfor almost all clinical measurements of vision.\nConclusion: Mild TBI affects processing in both the dorsal and ventral cortical processing streams.\nIn addition, our results suggest that PCSI symptom scores are associated with spatiotemporal\ncontrast sensitivity, a lower-level visual function, rather than performance on higher-level\nglobal integration tasks.","title":"Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Disrupts Global Processing of Form and Motion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180133\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Optometry and Vision Science School, University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Arijit Chakraborty, Kristine Dalton, Patrick Quaid, Ben Dunkley, Benjamin Thompson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Optometry and Vision Science School, University of Waterloo, Optometry and Vision Science School, University of Waterloo, Optometry and Vision Science School, University of Waterloo, Hospital for Sick Children, School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of Waterl\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

In addition to correcting refractive error to maximize visual acuity and reduce\nanisometropia, bandage contact lenses are often required to prevent corneal insult\nand improve patient comfort. The contact lens management of two KPro patients with\nchronic hypotony will be discussed.\n\nCase Report: Case 1: A 68-year-old African-American female presented for a post-KPro contact\nlens fitting in the right eye. She had a history of chronic uveitis of unknown etiology,\nchronic hypotony, two failed penetrating keratoplasties, KPro implantation and silicone\noil placement. The patient was successfully fit with a 16.0mm Kontur soft lens lens\nwith a power of +15.50D which improved vision from 20/400 to 20/60. Over the course\nof several years, BCVA declined to 20/400 and the contact lens correction steadily\nincreased to +23.00D, indicating a shortening of axial length.\nCase 2:\nA 68-year-old Caucasian female with a stable KPro in the left eye developed chronic\nhypotony due to an exposed and leaking glaucoma drainage device. After the device\nwas removed, the patient was referred for a bandage contact lens refitting. Because\na large superior temporal elevation remained after the glaucoma drainage device explant,\nthe patient was initially fit with a flat, large diameter Kontur soft lens with with\nfollowing parameters: 9.80/-0.25D/22.0. A BCVA of 20/200 was achieved. Over the course\nof 3 years, her contact lens prescription increased by 20 diopters while visual acuity,\ntactile intraocular pressure, and retinal status remained stable.\nBoth patients\nfollowed a similar course including requiring changes in lens fit. They also were\nmonitored on a frequent basis by retina, glaucoma, and cornea subspecialists and considered\nstable. Upon discovery of the progressive hyperopic shift, the team was consulted\nfor possible intervention. Management options for progressive hypotony include removal\nof glaucoma drainage devices, intravitreal steroid injections, and silicone oil placement.\nThe treatment goal is to maintain the eye's shape and prevent loss of all remaining\nvision.\nConclusion: Hyperopic shift in the the KPro population can indicate progressive hypotony. While\nvisual acuity, tactile pressure, and retinal status can remain stable on clinical\nexam, a progressive hyperopic shift warrants communication with the the glaucoma and\nvitreoretinal subspecialists, especially if the patient is not already under their\ncare.","title":"Progressive Hyperopic Shift as an Indication to Control Chronic Hypotony in Two Patients  with Boston Type 1 Keratoprosthesis","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185001\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Illinois\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Charlotte Joslin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UIC Dept of Ophthalmology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

She wore a bandage contact lens for comfort and prevention of corneal\ndesiccation and melt. For four years she wore the same size (base curve and diameter)\nof contact lens with no issues. On this follow up she reported discomfort and the\ncontact lens was noted to have lifted inferiorly and was resting on her lower lid.\nHer cornea was ectatic but the keratoprosthesis was healthy and intact, and she was\nre-fit into a steeper contact lens.

One week later she was scheduled for removal of the keratoprosthesis and\ncorneal transplantation.\nConclusion: In keratoprosthesis patients, practitioners are unable to reliably perform topography\nfor detection of ectasia in the donor cornea. Through the changes in fit of the bandage\ncontact lens, a practitioner is able to monitor changes to detect early extrusion.\nEarly intervention may be possible before full extrusion occurs, preventing risk of\ninfection, choroidal hemorrhage, and loss of vision.","title":"Changes in Bandage Contact Lens Fit as a Predictor of Early Keratoprosthesis KPRO  Extrusion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185002\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        John Seedor, David Ritterband\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

In some instances, scleral contact\nlenses can be used as a treatment for LSCD. This report looks at two cases: the first\ncase is a patient with LSCD who is fit with a scleral lens for improved vision, comfort,\nand ocular protection; the second is a patient with induced LSCD secondary to a poorly-fit\nscleral lens.\n\nCase Report: A 68-year-old Caucasian male was referred to the clinic for a scleral contact lens\nfit. He reported a history of ammonia splashing into his eyes in the 1970s and has\nhad severe photosensitivity, tearing, stinging and discomfort that was rated as 6/10\nsince. He has been using Restasis BID OU x 1 year, Restore Tears 7-8x/day OU and has\nhad multiple amniotic membranes OU with no improvement in his ocular comfort. His\nvision through glasses was 20/40- OD and 20/60- OS. Both eyes demonstrated 2+ bulbar\nconjunctival injection and inferior opacification of the cornea with neovascularization\nOS>>OD due to chronic LSCD. Lipid deposition from the neovascularization and\nsteel-wool keratopathy from long-term corneal inflammation were present OS. After\n18 months of scleral lens wear, his vision improved to 20/20 OD and 20/30 OS with\nsignificant improvement in ocular comfort and redness. He has since discontinued use\nof artificial tears and Restasis.\nA 52-year-old Caucasian female presented\nto the clinic for a corneal consult due to decreasing vision with scleral lens wear\nOU. She reported a history of epithelial basement membrane dystrophy for which she\nwas treated with a keratectomy OU. After surgery, she developed a MRSA infection OS.\nAfter resolution, she was fit with scleral lenses OU to improve her vision. She reported\nthat she had worn three different types of scleral lenses. Her vision through scleral\nlenses was 20/100 OD and 20/400 OS. Both eyes demonstrated whorl keratopathy, greatest\nsuperiorly OU. While her current scleral lenses revealed an ideal fit, her previous\npair of scleral lenses had moderate bearing along the superior limbus OU. The patient\nreported that the second pair of lenses were the most comfortable and thus were the\npair she liked to wear most. The patient was asked to discontinue scleral contact\nlens wear, use dexamethasone 0.1% BID OU and Maxitrol ung qd OU. She had difficulty\ndiscontinuing scleral contact lens wear and her vision remains reduced years later.\nConclusion: A scleral lens fit can dictate whether an already delicate cornea may progress to\nLSCD or stabilize a LSCD cornea. Patients who have decreasing vision with scleral\nlens wear should be monitored for worsening or new-onset LSCD and the fit should be\nimproved to ensure that there is no further damage to the limbal stem cells.","title":"Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency and Scleral Lens Wear","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        185004\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Robert Fintelmann\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Exhibit Hall 3\n                    \n            |#|"}

The goal of this study was to create and evaluate a new\nsilent, naturalistic reading test that contains longer passages to more closely mimic\ncommon daily reading tasks. Comprehension questions were also included as a measure\nof reading performance. This reading test could be used as an overall measure of reading\nability in fully-sighted people and in the evaluation of rehabilitation models in\nwhich reading performance is a primary outcome, such as low vision rehabilitation.\nMethods: Twelve nonfiction passages based on scientific articles geared towards children were\nproduced. Each passage contains 300 words and only includes the 5,000 most commonly\nused words in the English language. Flesch-Kincaid reading ease for the passages ranged\nfrom 69.4 to 78.9 and grade level for the passages ranged from 5.3 to 6.8. Four comprehension\nquestions were created to accompany each passage. Each subject was asked to answer\nthe comprehension questions associated with six of the 12 passages without reading\nthe passages beforehand. Then, each subject read the other six passages and answered\nthe questions associated with those passages. Reading was timed and the percentage\nof correct responses to questions assessed. Criteria for selecting passages and questions\nincluded a correct guess rate for the passage's associated questions of no more than\n30% for subjects who had not read the passage beforehand and an incorrect answer rate\nof no more than 10% for subjects who had read the passage beforehand.\nResults: Twenty fully-sighted subjects were recruited for a first evaluation of the passages\nand questions. Mean ± SD age was 32 ± 13 with a range of 21 to 59 years, 65% were\nfemale, and all subjects had BCVA of 20/20 or better. The average passage reading\nspeed was 288 ± 67 words per minute. Passage reading speed showed a significant correlation\nwith MNRead reading accessibility index (r = 0.38, p = 0.049). Six passages, with\none question discarded each, were selected out of the twelve to comprise the final\nreading test.\nConclusion: This new naturalistic reading test showed an association with an established reading\nspeed test, MNRead, and the comprehension questions for the six passages performed\nwell. This test has the potential to evaluate reading comprehension and provide a\nreading experience that more closely mimics daily tasks.

{"_type":"dict","author":"Quinn Gallen","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/the-influence-of-skimming-behaviors-on-dyslexic-readers","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Many dyslexic readers resort to skimming behaviors (SB) in efforts to reduce confusion\nand increase efficiency. SB's are prevalent with dyslexics and introduce significant\nvariability to reading metrics. It was anticipated that removal of their influence\non our dyslexic population sample would confirm previous results and reveal other,\nweaker relationships obscured by noise created by SB. We endeavored to discriminate\nbetween skimming and non-skimming behaviors in dyslexic readers seen through the Pupil\nProject at UMSL. Our initial analysis of these two groups established whether they\nrepresent unique populations. Then, we hoped to establish more precise relationships\nbetween single word (SW) decoding ability and duration of fixation (DOF), fixation\nnumber (Fix), regression errors (RE) and rapid automatized naming (RAN) in our non-skimming\n(NSB) dyslexic patients.\nMethods: SB's were defined by two parameters: (1) fewer fixations/100 words than the grade\nreferenced mean and (2) an improved fixation metric with grade appropriate reading\npassages. After outlier elimination, 187 patients (104 NSB; 83 SB), age range 8-16,\nIQ 85-129 participated in this study. T-test, correlation and regression statistics\nwere used to explore differences between SB's and NSB's then to explore relative contribution\nof various tests to unique variance in SW decoding for each group.\nResults: T-test revealed significant differences between most all measured attributes of ocular\nmotility (where the effects of skimming are most evident). SB dyslexics could be discriminated\nfrom NSB dyslexics (p< 0.00-0-.014), except for reading rate (p=.166) and DOF (p=.558)\nfor below grade level passages. For virtually all measured attributes, equal variances\ncould not be assumed, with exception of DOF and reading rate. For NSB dyslexics, there\nwas a strong negative correlation between DOF (p=-.24), Fix (p=-.22), RE (p=-.23)\nand SW decoding. For SB dyslexics, there was no consistent relationship between ocular\nmotor skills and decoding ability. Multiple regression for NSB dyslexics revealed\nsignificant contribution to variance in SW decoding for DOF (sig=.049), Fix (sig=.025)\nand spelling (sig=.03) in the most appropriate model (sig=.000). No statistically\nsignificant model could be established for SB dyslexics.\nConclusion: SB and NSB patients demonstrate independence, save DOF and Rate at below grade levels,\nwhere benefits of skimming are minimized. Results indicate DOF and Fix measures correlate\nand contribute significantly to variance with SW decoding skills (along with spelling\nskills). Results crystallize previously reported relationships between ocular motor\nskills and SW decoding skills and reveal other ocular motor metrics that contribute\nsignificantly to SW decoding variance. The value of recording ocular motor metrics\nof dyslexic children when decoding below grade level material was validated. Sight\nwords are more prevalent, minimizing the usefulness of SB.","title":"The Influence of Skimming Behaviors on Dyslexic Readers","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180121\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UM St Louis College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Aaron Franzel, Erin Brooks\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UM St Louis College of Optometry, UM St Louis College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

The specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the BIVSS\nfor predicting visual symptoms associated with TBI has been previously established.\nMethods: Subjects (n=130, mean age 37 +/- 17.6, range 19 to 55) with mild-to-moderate TBI were\nrecruited via optometrists who attended COVD and NORA annual meetings. Subjects who\nconsented to participate, completed the 28-item BIVSS questionnaire at two times (1-hr\nmin separation to 4-months max interval). The questionnaire included check boxes designating\n\"I've had a medical diagnosis of brain injury; I sustained brain injury without medical\ndiagnosis; I have NOT sustained a brain injury\". In addition, fill-in blanks asked\n\"how long ago was the brain injury\" and \"what was the cause\". 25-subjects reported\nmedically diagnosed TBI, 5 reported undiagnosed TBI, 14-reported no history of injury,\nand 87-subjects did not check any of the 3-aforementioned boxes (despite many listing\na cause and date of injury). These were analyzed as the \"not specified\" group. A scoring\nalgorithm was developed for the BIVSS, and both Rasch and Likert were used for analyses.\nBland-Altman charts illustrating both methods analyses were created, and limits of\nagreement calculated.\nResults: Results indicate no significant difference in score on re-test for any group or method\nof analysis with the exception of Rasch analysis for the \"˜not specified' group (p=0.01).\nA one sample t-test performed on Rasch and Likert analyses for each patient category\nrevealed no significant bias in scoring higher or lower on retest with the exception\nof the not specified group and Rasch analysis (n=87, t=3.41, p=0.01). If we restrict\nthe time between survey administrations to two weeks or less however, we see no significant\ndifference in any patient category with either method of analysis.

There is no significant bias in total BIVSS score between test administrations\nfor either patients who have experienced TBI or non-injured patients. More detailed\nfuture analysis of change in BIVSS subset scores concurrent with intervention could\npotentially reveal relationships between improvement in objective measurements and\nspecific subjective subset scores.","title":"Determining the TestRetest Reliability of the Brain Injury Vision Symptom Survey","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180128\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Cory Jensen, Hannu Laukkanen, John Hayes\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Pacific University College of Optometry, Pacific University College of Optometry, Pacific University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Thomas Freddo","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/validation-of-an-improved-method-for-patient-selfadministration-of-eye-drops","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: One goal of these studies was to determine whether self-administration of a single\ntimolol drop, using a novel method, produces a measurable reduction of introcular\npressure (IOP). A second goal was to determine whether the magnitude of the effect\nwas comparable to previous reports and comparable to the effect achieved when the\nsame drop was instilled by a trained clinician.\nMethods: With lids gently closed, instillation of an eyedrop near the medial canthus results\nin it being rapidly pulled across the seam between the upper and lower lid margins\nby capillary attraction. As it does so, the patient feels a \"cold and wet\" sensation. When the lids open, the drop is evenly distributed across the cornea.\nOne drop of timolol maleate 0.5% has been shown to reduce IOP in normals by 26%, at\n2 hrs. Thirty subjects were recruited from patients seen at the University of Waterloo\nPrimary Eye Care Clinic. The study was IRB-approved and Informed consent was obtained.\nExclusions included any eye disease beyond acute, but resolved, conjunctivitis and\nany condition precluding use of topical beta-blockers. Baseline IOP was obtained from\nrandomized enrollees in a masked fashion. One drop of timolol maleate 0.5% was instilled,\neither by a clinician or by the subject, after being trained to use the new method.\nTwo hours later, IOP was re-measured. After a week for drug washout, the procedure\nwas repeated, but with subjects assigned to the opposite group. Statistica software\nwas used to compare both absolute and percentage reductions in IOP by each method.\nResults: An average reduction of 3.75+/-2.36 mmHg was found after clinician administration\nof a single drop of 0.5% timolol maleate, and 3.32+/-2.31 mmHg using the alternative\nmethod of self-administration. No significant difference was found in magnitude of\nthe IOP reduction between the two groups (p=0.446). An average reduction of 25.17+/-16.21%\nwas found in the clinician administered group, while a reduction of 24.38+/-16.31%\nwas found in the new method group. These were not significantly different (p=0.833).\nThere were no reported cases of eye infection or persistent irritation within 3 months\nof study completion.\nConclusion: Both methods produced a percent reduction in IOP consistent with previous reports\nand no difference was found between clinican administration and self-administration\nusing this alternate method. Beyond the efficacy of the new method, it also has the\nadvantage that precise positioning of the dropper over the eye is not required. Furthermore,\nthe patient is more relaxed because they do not watch the drop fall onto their open\neye. Additionally, with lids closed, the risk of flicking lashes contaminating the\ndropper tip is eliminated. Unlike the current, widely-used method for eyedrop self-instillation,\nthe alternative method evaluated in this limited trial proved to be as reliable as\nadministration by a trained clinician.","title":"Validation of an Improved Method for Patient SelfAdministration of Eye Drops","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180109\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        MCP Health Sciences University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Yuan-Hao (Derek) Ho, Michelle Steenbakkers, Nadine Furtado\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo School of Optometry & Vision Science, Stittsville Optometry, University of Waterloo School of Optometry & Vision Science\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Mean IOP for scheduled\nvisits through 5 years ranged between 13.5 to 16.5 mmHg in both groups with 12/35\neyes in the iStent group required post-treatment medication compared to 18/32 eyes\nin the travoprost group. IOP ? 18 mmHg without additional medical therapy was reported\nin 77% of iStent eyes versus 53% of travoprost eyes at 5 years. An excellent safety\nprofile was observed in both groups. The most common event occurring over the 5-year\nperiod was progression of pre-existing cataract (both groups, ~30%).\nConclusion: In this study, both groups showed long-term substantial IOP reduction with favorable\nsafety over a 5-year period. More subjects in the 2 iStent treatment group achieved\nIOP ?18 mmHg without additional medical therapy and remained medication-free through\n5 years as compared to initial topical prostaglandin therapy. The data from this prospective\nstudy, comparing 2 iStent devices to topical prostaglandin therapy, supports the efficacy\nof multiple iStent implantations","title":"Longterm Outcomes of a Prospective Study of Two Trabecular MicroBypass Stents versus  Prostaglandin in Newly Diagnosed OpenAngle Glaucoma 5year Followup","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180114\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Vance Thompson Vision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        n/a\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

More\nimportantly, we hypothesize that text motion could improve reading, similar to a patient\nscanning. The rationale is that moving text may be detected with a more sensitive\nspatio-temporal mechanism, and that parts of letters that were obscured are revealed\nor are more noticeable by the motion. To select among the numerous parameters that\ncould allow an improvement in reading, we found noise contrast that significantly\ndegraded reading as compared to when there was no noise, and then compared these results\nto when the text was moving.\nMethods: We tested a broad range of subjects without macular scotomata: 9 subjects aged between\n27 and 70 yr (48.1 + 17.1 yr, 56% female and 44% male, and a broad range of\nspherical error: 3.5 to -7.5 D). Using a digital light ophthalmoscope (DLO), we presented\nsentences via Maxwellian view in a 28 x 18 deg field and simultaneously captured retinal\nimages at 860 nm in a 28 deg field that was superimposed at the same focal plane.\nSubjects read each IU Read sentence separately, which were displayed with a 1920 x\n1080 pixel resolution, at 20/60 Helvetica font. The contrast (delta I/I) of text was\nreduced to 50%. The added noise had a center spatial frequency of 5.8 c/deg, and contrast\nfrom 0 to 80%. Each 10 - 14 word sentence was moved horizontally in a sinusoid, with\nthe experimenter setting the amplitude from 0 to 2 deg and velocity from 0 to 2 Hz.\nResults: Reading of text in noise was improved by text motion, depending on noise contrast\nand with individual differences. With the noise at 60% contrast, subjects spent more\ntime trying to guess the words without text motion than with 1 deg, 0.5 Hz text motion\n(19.3 vs. 13.3 sec, p = .043). There were more errors without text motion than with\n(4.48 vs. .222 words/sentence, p = .015). Reading speed was slower without vs. with\ntext motion (51.8 vs. 76.3 words/min, p = .0084). Text motion without noise led to\nmissing only 0.05 words/sentence. With the noise at 80% contrast, 7 of 9 subjects\nmissed at least ½ of the words in each sentence without text motion (7.68 without\nvs. 1.51 words/sentence with text motion, p = .00012). Reading speed with text motion\nwas 47.6 words/min. Reading speed without text motion was significantly slower, but\nwas inaccurate due to the large proportion of missed words (p = .046).\nConclusion: The improvement found with text motion for reading sentences that are degraded with\nvisual noise may translate to helping patients with low vision who have remaining\nmacular function. Moving the text may be beneficial to some patients who cannot optimize\nscanning techniques.","title":"Improving the Reading of Sentences in Noise by Text Motion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180115\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Robert Gilbert, Shirin Hassan, Raymond Warner, Bryan Haggerty, Elli Kollbaum, Matthew Muller\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry, Aeon Imaging, LLC\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Investigating how presentation mode impacts comprehension\nfor blind individuals will inform the distribution of information to enhance reading\ncomprehension. The aim of this study was to explore how currently-used assistive technology\nimpacts reading comprehension among braille readers.\nMethods: In a within-subjects design, 32 blind participants (age range 19 years to 71 years;\nmedian age 46.5 years) read and listened to high-school biology passages and verbally\nanswered free-response questions about the passages. The presentation modes included\nbraille (hard-copy braille and a refreshable braille display) and audio (voice actor\nrecordings and a screen reader). The average comprehension score (given as a proportion\nvalue out of 1.0) was compared between presentation modes.\nResults: Comprehension scores were analyzed using mixed-effects regression and pairwise comparisons\non the estimated marginal means. Comprehension was better on average with hard-copy\nbraille (mean=0.706; 95% CI [confidence interval]: 0.634 to 0.777) compared to with\na screen reader (mean=0.607; 95% CI: 0.535 to 0.679; P=.023) and with a refreshable\nbraille display (mean=0.697; 95% CI: 0.625 to 0.769) compared to with a screen reader\n(P=.040).\nConclusion: Reading scientific passages using hard-copy braille or a refreshable braille display\nresulted in better comprehension of scientific passages compared to using a screen\nreader, but not compared to listening to voice actor recordings.

We reported a slight improvement\nin contrast sensitivity (CS) and visual acuity (VA) after acute consumption of dark\nchocolate (DC) vs. milk chocolate (MC; doi:10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2018.0978). Our\npurpose was to extend this effort to include an additional measure of CS and low contrast\nVA and model the overall improvement in CS after DC.\nMethods: A randomized, masked crossover design was used to assess VA and CS after acute consumption\nof a DC bar (47 g; cacao, 34 g; total flavanols, 316.3 mg) vs. a MC bar (40 g; milk\nchocolate cocoa, 12.4 g; total flavanols, 40 mg, 8X less flavanols than DC bar). 30\nhealthy adults (mean age 26±5) participated in DC and MC study arms in two separate\nsessions separated by at least 72 hours. Subjects were unaware of the chocolate type\nconsumed 2 hrs. before testing with order (MC vs DC) randomized. Subjects were tested\nbinocularly with best correction on large letter CS (Pelli-Robson chart, 1m, 20/670\nletters), small letter (CS, 20/25) and high contrast VA at 4m (Super Vision Test,\nPrecision Vision, Inc.) and near CS (20/260 letters) and low contrast (6%) VA (response\ndriven staircase, MS Surface , 91 cm; Innova Systems, Inc.). ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests\nwere used to assess VA and CS. Data from all five measures were converted to Michelson\ncontrast and spatial frequency (assuming 2.5 cycles per letter) to determine best-fit\nCS functions.\nResults: Two-way repeated measures ANOVA across chocolate (DC vs. MC) and test type showed\na significant increase in VA and CS with DC vs. MC (F=5.9, p<0.02). Most significant\neffects were obtained for small letter CS (DC mean 1.45 logCS, MC 1.30, p < 0.001)\nand 20/260 CS (DC 1.95 logCS, MC 1.88, p<0.003) with smaller improvements for high\ncontrast VA (DC mean -0.22 logMAR, MC -0.18, p < 0.03) and large letter CS (DC\nmean 2.06 logCS, MC 2.0, p <0.04) with a trend toward better low contrast VA after\nDC (DC 0.17 logMAR, MC 0.19, p=0.08). Expressing all data as CS and spatial frequency,\nboth DC and MC data were best-fit by by exponential functions (r\n2\n=0.98)\nwith identical shapes and negative exponents allowing for compaison and prediction\nof values across DC and MC domains. We reached a ceilng effect for VA limited by cone\nspacing but observed greater improvement in CS likely limited by cortical processing.\nConclusion: These findings provide further evidence for an improvement in CS following acute consumption\nof DC vs. MC. It is possible that increased blood flow to the retina, visual pathway\nor cortex may underlie this enhancement.

The aim of this study was to compare CamBlobs2\nwith PR scores in patients with optic neuropathy.\nMethods: Thirteen patients (mean age 42 ± 12 years) with optic neuropathy in at least one eye\nperformed the CamBlobs2 and PR tests monocularly with their habitual reading condition,\nunder normal room lighting. CamBlobs2 comprises 25 lines of 9-mm diameter round blobs\n(four randomly positioned blobs on each line) whose contrast decreases by 0.05 log\nunits per line (logCS ranges from 0.80 to 2.05). Subjects were asked to mark the positions\nof blobs on each line starting from the top of the chart; the logCS of the highest\nline with two or fewer blobs marked correctly was recorded. PR test was scored with\neach correct letter counted as 0.05 logCS (range 0.00 to 2.40). Mean logCS from PR\nand CamBlobs2 scores were compared using paired t-test. Agreement between the two\ntests were evaluated with Bland- Altman plots. Mean logCS score of each test from\neyes with optic neuropathy was compared to that from normal controls (n = 31, mean\nage 37 ± 14 years) using two sample t-test.\nResults: The group with optic neuropathy included 20 eyes: 8 optic neuritis, 2 non-arteriticanterior\nischemic optic neuropathy, 10 papilledema; 18 of them had 20/25 or better high contrast\nSnellen acuity. The mean difference between PR and CamBlobs2 logCS scores (PR -\nCamBlobs2)\nfor the group with optic neuropathy was 0.08, significantly different from zero (p\n= 0.01); 0.01 (p = 0.62) for normal control. The 95% limit of agreement between the\nlogCS scores of the two tests was - 0.17 to 0.33 for optic neuropathy and - 0.17 to\n0.18 for normal control. The group mean (± SD) CamBlobs logCS for eyes with optic\nneuropathy was 1.72 ± 0.11, significantly worse than that of normal control (1.84\n± 0.10, p = 0.00018); the mean PR logCS (1.81 ± 0.17) did not differ significantly\nfrom that of normal (p = 0.33).\nConclusion: The logCS scores measured by CamBlobs2 were significantly lower than those obtained\nby PR in eyes with optic neuropathy. CamBlobs2 might be more sensitive than PR in\ndetecting CS loss in optic neuropathy. More study subjects with optic neuropathy are\nneeded\nto validate our finding.","title":"Using CamBlobs2 disposable paper chart to test contrast sensitivity in patients with  optic neuropathy","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180100\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Han Cheng, Andrea Griffin, Rosa Tang, J.G.

The disparity range over which BS occurs varies\ninversely with spatial frequency. However, while the upper disparity limit of stereopsis\nand the range of sensory fusion have shown dependence on interocular phase disparities\nof narrow band targets, such phase disparity dependence has not been elucidated with\nsub-threshold binocular contrast summation. This study investigated the dependence\nof the magnitude of BS on target spatial frequency and induced vertical and horizontal\nphase disparity.\nMethods: Monocular and binocular contrast detection thresholds were measured for 5 interocular\nphase disparities (0, +/- 90, +/- 180 degrees) at each of 3 carrier spatial frequencies\n(1, 3, 9 cpd) using horizontal and vertical Gabor targets. Nine subjects with normal\nbinocularity participated in the study. Stimuli were presented on a linearized CRT\nmonitor using a 2 IFC method-of-constant stimulus. Dichoptic viewing was achieved\nwith the use of cross polarizes affixed to the monitor and to the eye pieces of a\nphoropter. Prisms which neutralized the vertical and horizontal phoria were worn throughout\neach experimental session.\nResults: While the magnitude of BS varied with vertical interocular phase disparity for all\n3 carrier spatial frequencies, however, BS varied with horizontal phase disparity\nonly for the 1 and 3cpd vertical gratings. BS with the vertical 9cpd grating remained\napproximately invariant with induced horizontal phase disparities.\nConclusion: The scaling of BS magnitude with phase disparities supports a role for spatial frequency-tuned\nphase sensitive mechanisms operating in BS. The lack of horizontal phase dependence\nof BS specifically for the high carrier spatial frequency (>3cpd) parallels the\ntrends reported for both sensory fusion and stereopsis, and as such, may allude to\ncommon limiting mechanisms.","title":"SubThreshold Binocular Contrast Summation Scales with Interocular Phase Disparity","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180101\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Michigan College of Optomery Ferris State Univ.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Tabytha Boykins\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Michigan College of Optomery Ferris State Univ.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Computerised DVA\ncharts allow for a wide variety of different optotypes designs, such as Latin letters,\nnumbers, Tumbling Es and Landolt Cs to be used in the measurement of DVA. The most\ncommon optotype used to measure DVA has been the Landolt C, however Sloan letters\nand Tumbling Es have also been used. It is unknown whether optotype design affects\ndynamic visual acuity measurements. Therefore, study was designed to determine if\nperformance on a DVA task changed with different optotype designs.\nMethods: 19 healthy, adult participants (28.0 ± 12.0 years; 8 male, 11 female) were recruited\nfor this study. Participants' best corrected monocular static visual acuities had\nto be at least 0.2 logMAR in each eye and participants' stereopsis had to be ? 60\nsec of arc. Binocular static visual acuity (EDTRS chart; per-letter scoring) and binocular\nDVA (moV&, V&mp Vision Suite; per-letter scoring) were measured; DVA was measured\nusing three different optotype designs (Sloan letters, Tumbling Es, Landolt Cs) for\nboth horizontal and random motion at 1m/s. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare binocular\nstatic and dynamic visual acuities, and a two-way ANOVA was used to compare between\nDVA between motion types and optotype designs. This study was conducted in accordance\nwith the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and received ethics clearance through\na University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee.\nResults: 15 participants were able to complete all of the DVA tests and were included in the\ndata analysis; 4 participants (2 male, 2 female) were excluded from the analysis because\nthey could not complete all of the DVA tests. Participants' binocular static visual\nacuity (n = 15) was -0.14 ± 0.09 logMAR (range -0.22 to 0.04 logMAR). DVA Overall\n(across all optotypes and motion types) was 0.19 ± 0.17 logMAR, and was significantly\nworse than static visual acuity (p < 0.001). There was no significant interaction\nbetween motion type (horizontal or random) and optotype design for DVA (F(2,5) = 0.054,\np = 0.947). DVA was found to be similar for both horizontal and random motion (p =\n0.167), and between the Sloan, Landolt C, and Tumbling E optotype designs (p = 0.720).\nConclusion: Consistent with previous literature, DVA was significantly worse than static visual\nacuity.

Recognition (form) acuity can be more accurately measured in young children\nwith face acuity targets compared to existing tests.\nPurpose: To develop a visual\nacuity test (VA) that measures recognition (form) acuity at a younger age than is\ncurrently clinically possible. We used schematic Face or Patti Pics optotypes in a\nspatial two alternative forced choice (2AFC). Adults were tested to determine which\nform VA test is most comparable to ETDRS VA. Infants (15-48 months) were tested to\ndetermine the feasibility of the test to measure VA in this age group.\nMethods: A series of cards for each optotype was designed. The Face Cards had a smiley face\nand a dotted target as optotypes. Patti Pics cards used the house and the circle.\nThere was a logarithmic progression in spacing and size (30M to 0.5M, range of VA\nof 1.3 to -0.1 logMAR for a 60 cm testing distance) throughout the series.\nIn\nadults, form VA was measured by Face Cards, Patti Pics Cards, and near ETDRS chart\nmonocularly, in a counter-balanced order under 3 conditions of optical blur; +4.00D,\n+2.50D and no blur. Testability and VA were measured in infants on 2 visits using\nthe Face Cards and Patti Pics Cards in a counter-balanced order. First, the child\nwas trained to point at the target stimulus (face or house). A correct response level\nof 3/4 was required for the infant to be considered testable. If the child passed\nthe testability, VA measurement followed. The examiner was blind to the position of\nthe target stimulus except during the training phase. For reference, testability for\nmatching with the Patti Pics and VA with the Cardiff cards were measured.\nResults: Mean age for adults was 27± 3.5 years (N=17). Repeated measure ANOVA showed a significant\ndifference (p<0.05) between Patti Pics and ETDRS (mean difference 0.29 logMAR for\n4D blur) and between Patti Pics and Face Cards (0.33 logMAR). No significant difference\nwas found between Face Cards and ETDRS (0.04 logMAR). The same pattern of differences\nwas found for all levels of blur. Testability of 17 typically developing infants (mean\nage 27.5 ± 8.1 months) was equal (64.7%) for Face and Patti Pics 2AFC and matching\nwith Patti Pics. All participants aged ?26 months could perform all three tests. A\nsignificant difference was found between Face Cards and Cardiff Cards (mean difference\n0.35 logMAR, p<0.01), while no significant difference was found between Face Cards\nand Patti Pics (0.15 logMAR), or between Patti Pics and Cardiff Cards (0.2 logMAR).\nCorrelation between age and VA was; Face Cards r=0.76, Patti Pics Cards r=0.79, Cardiff\nCards r=0.71 (p?0.005 in all cases).\nConclusion: Face Cards give VA more similar to ETDRS acuity than Patti Pics in adults and may\nprovide a valuable alternative method for measuring recognition VA in young children.\nForm acuity values increased with age over the infant range at a higher rate than\nresolution.","title":"Recognition Visual Acuity in Infants Using Face Optotypes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180103\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Elizabeth Irving, Susan Leat\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo School of Optometry & Vision Science\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Subjects were diagnosed as CI (based on criteria established\nin the CITT studies) or BNC by one of the co-authors (MS). The clinical exam included:\nnear the point of convergence (NPC), near dissociated phoria (NDP), positive fusional\nvergence at near (PFV) and Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS). Disparity\nvergence was stimulated during the fMRI experiment by having subjects fuse on eccentric\nsquares which alternated 5 times between the following three blocks: 1) 15 sec of\nsustained fixation, 2) 19 sec of 4 vergence stimuli (4.75 sec allotted per movement),\nand 3) 18 sec of 8 vergence stimuli (2.5 sec allotted per movement).

The\nshapes (called Stereosticks) require accurate convergence and sensory fusion to be\ndiscerned. Stereosticks are proposed as an alternative to conventional near fixation\ntargets, specifically for the pediatric and post traumatic brain injury populations\nwho may show improved convergence ability with stereopsis.\nMethods: The targets were constructed using lenslet arrays consisting of vertical half cylinders.\nA random dot stereo pair behind the lenslet array produces the 3D shape. Five shapes\nwere generated, the disparity of each being 0.5 degrees.\nExperiment 1: Convergence\naccuracy required for Stereostick images.\nA computer display showed two half images\nof each stereo shape in a mirror haploscope configuration. Subjects first held fixation\non a dot with the aid of dichoptic nonius lines. The binocular targets were then presented\nfor 200 milliseconds and subjects reported the perceived shape. On each trial, the\ntarget was presented with eleven disparity levels in a shuffled order, and 20 trials\nwere completed to generate a complete data set for one subject.\nExperiment\n2: Patient acceptance of Stereosticks vs. pencil push-ups.\nPatients aged 3 to\n10 years old who were diagnosed with Convergence Insufficiency were asked to compare\nStereosticks to conventional pencil push-up exercises. 20 subjects were enrolled and\nwere randomized to start with either pencil push-ups or training with the Stereosticks.\nThey trained for 2 weeks with the given assignment and then switched to the alternate\nexercise. They completed a survey on compliance and ease of use. Parents completed\nthe survey for children less than 7 years old. For children aged 7 through 10, separate\nparent and child surveys were given.\nResults: Experiment 1. All subjects show a similar falloff in performance at a disparity of\n+/- 1 prism diopters.\nExperiment 2. 14 subjects completed all required questionnaires.\n7 subjects were over the age of 7 and rated the Stereosticks exercise as more engaging\nthan pencil push-ups. 7 subjects were under the age of 7, and all 7 parents reported\nit was easier to obtain compliance and assess their child's performance with Stereosticks\nas compared to using pencils.\nConclusion: The results from these measurements show that the stereo shape can only be discerned\nif the subject fixates accurately to within +/- 1 prism diopter. Thus, a correct report\nof the shape indicates both functioning stereopsis and accurate convergence.\nPediatric\nsubjects uniformly preferred the Stereosticks to the standard push-up pencil task.\nParents of younger children unanimously agreed that it was easier to administer the\nexercise and know whether their child was performing it correctly with the Stereosticks.\nFurther\nresearch is required to establish whether Stereosticks are more effective training\ntools than pencils push-ups for treatment of Convergence Insufficiency.","title":"Random Dot Shapes for Near Convergence Testing and Training","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180105\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Marshall B.

It has been used in studies of concussion to quantify visual\nsymptoms, as it addresses many of the same symptom areas that are prevalent following\nthis type of injury. The CISS has been validated in children ages 9<18 years, which\nsolidifies its utility in the pediatric population. The aim of this study was to optimize\nthe cut-point of the CISS to identify symptomatic binocular vision disorders in adolescents\ndiagnosed with concussion.\nMethods: A sensorimotor evaluation was completed to identify those children with a binocular\nvision disorder (BVD). The CISS was utilized to quantify subjective visual symptoms\nof each subject. The area under the Receiver-Operator Characteristic (aROC) curve\nwas used to quantify the ability of the CISS to identify BVDs (based on a sensorimotor\nevaluation) associated with high symptom burden. Test performance was assessed at\nvarious cut-points of the CISS with a goal of maximizing sensitivity and negative\npredictive value.\nResults: 34 children (ages 9 - 17 years) with sports-related concussion (SRC) completed both\nthe sensorimotor evaluation and CISS at 9.5 (± 6.5) days following injury. 79% of\nsubjects were found to have a BVD while 58.8% of subjects scored ? 16 on the CISS.\nThe overall mean CISS was 19.97 (± 10.2); 22.59 (± 9.9) in those with a BVD and 9.86\n(± 2.5) in those without a BVD. The screening ability of the CISS was excellent with\nan aROC of 0.87 (95% CI = 0.75, 0.99). Using the conventional CISS cut-point of 16\nto identify those with and without BVD, the sensitivity is 74.1% (95% CI = 57.6, 90.6)\nand specificity 100%. Using 11 or higher on the CISS to define high symptom level,\nthe sensitivity increases to 85.2% (95% CI = 71.8, 98.6) and reduction in specificity\nto 71.4% (95% CI = 37.9, 100). To maintain the specificity at 100%, a cut-point of\n12 would be used (sensitivity = 85.2%; 95% CI = 71.8, 98.6).\nConclusion: BVDs are common in adolescents with concussion. The CISS is useful in quantifying\nvision symptoms associated with SRC. These results suggest using a cut-point of greater\nthan or equal to 12 will improve the ability of the survey to identify those children\nwith symptomatic BVD after SRC. This is important so that they may be directed to\na more comprehensive vision evaluation and subsequent treatment plan.","title":"Optimizing the Cutpoint of the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey to Identify  Symptomatic Binocular Vision Disorders in Adolescents with Concussion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180106\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Adam Peiffer, James MacDonald, Andrew Hartwick, G.

We assessed the validity\nand reliability of Positive Fusional Vergence (PFV) and Negative Fusional Vergence\n(NFV) measurements obtained with a prototype instrument (Binocular Vision Analysis\nSystem, BiVAS, Apple Medical Incubator, Winter Park, FL), compared to measurements\nobtained by a trained clinician.\nMethods: The BiVAS, which consists of a viewer box, stimulus display, computer, eye tracking\nsystem, and custom software, controls stimulus presentation and records interpupillary\ndistance over time as the eyes converge and diverge to track stimuli. Four non-strabismic\nadults with near acuity of 20/25 or better completed PFV and NFV testing 3 times with\nthe BiVAS and 3 times with an optometrist.

Since pedestrian's\ncrashes are frequent at night, cataracts may severely affect the safety of pedestrians\nand the driver. However, the impact of cataracts presented in one or both eyes in\ncombination with oncoming HLG is not known. By measuring pedestrian detection performance\nin our driving simulator before, between, and after cataract surgeries, we can effectively\nfactor out other individual variabilities that affect nighttime driving.\nMethods: So far, seven patients with bilateral cataracts (46 to 74 years old) were enrolled.\nFour patients completed all three performance measures (before and after a cataract\nsurgery for the first eye, and after the following surgery for the second eye) and\nthree patients completed first two driving performance measures. After each surgery,\nat least two weeks of a period was given before the next performance measure. All\nsubjects drove three nighttime scenarios with the HLG simulator turned on and off\n(HLGY/HLGN). Each scenario lasted about 12 minutes and contained 24 pedestrian encounters\nof four different types (pedestrians appear at the left/right sidewalk, and then walk\nalong/cross the road). A three-way mixed model ANOVA (HLG condition Ã— cataract status\nÃ— pedestrian type) was applied to the patients' pedestrian response time. Similar\nmixed model ANOVAs were applied to the visual acuity and contrast sensitivity values\nmeasured before each driving simulator performance measure.\nResults: Significant main effects of HLG (F(1, 39.48) = 86.92, p < 0.01) and cataract status\n(F(2, 30.45) = 17.40, p < 0.01) were found. Patients responded slower with HLGY\nthan HLGN, and the response time improved as cataracts were removed. A significant\ninteraction between HLG and cataract status was also found (F(2, 30.45) = 6.30, p\n< 0.01), where the response time following surgeries improved for the HLGY condition\nand barely for the HLGN condition (Fig. 1). The post-hoc analysis confirmed that the\nsecond eye cataract surgery significantly improved the response time with HLGY (t(11)=5.40,\np<0.01), while it did not significantly improve the response time with HLGN. Contrast\nsensitivity was significantly improved as cataracts were removed from each eye (F(1,\nF(1, 16.77)=966.70, p<0.01), but visual acuity was not significantly improved.\nThe response times of individual patient who completed both eye surgeries are shown\nin Fig. 2.\nConclusion: These early results show that the impact of even mild cataracts may be severe on detecting\npedestrians in the presence of HLG. It seems that one eye cataract surgery reduces\nthe negative impact of HLG, but surgery for the other eye further improves performance\nwith HLG.","title":"Impact of Cataract Surgeries on Oncoming Headlight Glare","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180089\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens ERI, MEE, Harvard Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Rachel Castle, Sailaja Manda, Eli Peli\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens ERI, MEE, Harvard Medical School, Schepens ERI, MEE, Harvard Medical School, Schepens ERI, MEE, Harvard Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, most evidence in this\narea is based on survey data as no clinical test is available. In this study, a practical\nLED traffic light test was developed and evaluated.\nMethods: Subjects (n = 39, mean/SD age = 28.0/7.2 yrs.) with and without color vision deficiency\nparticipated. Anomaloscope and Farnsworth D15 testing was conducted on all patients\nusing a Richmond Illuminator (standard illuminant C equivalent) at 500 lux of illuminance.\nThe traffic signal test consisted of 9 LED lights (i.e. 3 green, 3 red, and 3 yellow)\nwith CIE (x,y) coordinates within the US traffic signal specifications verified by\nan X-rite i1pro. A center LED was surrounded by 8 other LEDs in a circular pattern.\nEach traffic color was presented in random order, one at a time, for 2 seconds at\na distance of 8 feet in a room with ambient illuminance of 200 lux. Misidentifying\nany light was considered a failure.\nResults: All subjects were testable and had good compliance with administration. Color normal\nsubjects (n = 30) were confirmed by anomaloscope testing and all color vision tests\nperfectly, including scoring 9 out of 9 on the traffic test (i.e. specificity = 100%).\nIn the color defective subject group, five had dichromacy (i.e. protanopia = 3, deuteranopia\n= 2) and four had anomalous trichromacy (anomaloscope range: 5-35). Six color defective\nsubjects failed the Farnsworth D15 test. The color defective group had an average/SD\nof 8.2/1.1 correct out of 9 on the traffic test (range: 6-9) with 4 subjects having\nmisses (sensitivity = 44%). Yellow vs. red was the only confusion that occurred. The\nnumber of misses did not clearly correlate with the severity or type of the color\nvision defect.\nConclusion: A practical test for traffic signals can be developed. Color defective subjects can\nmisidentify traffic signal colors, confusing yellow and red. In practical situations,\nlocation cues and contextual clues likely assist in safe driving.

{"_type":"dict","author":"Maureen Plaumann","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/using-the-synoptophore-to-quantify-interocular-suppression-in-amblyopia","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Unilateral amblyopia is associated with decreased visual functions caused by abnormal\nbinocular interaction during visual development. Therefore, treating amblyopia with\nanti-suppression techniques is a mainstay of therapy. However, many treatment outcome\nmeasures rely solely on visual acuity (VA) and there is no formal measurement of suppression\nmade at either the beginning or end of treatment. Those who do measure suppression\noften rely on tests such as Bagolini and Worth 4-Dot, which may not be sensitive enough\nto detect a change in suppression dynamics following treatment. This study investigated\nhow the synoptophore can be used to quantitatively measure interocular suppression.\nMethods: Interocular suppression was assessed using the Haag-Streit Synoptophore, 2001 Model.\nNine conditions were measured using standard 1\nst\nand 2\nnd\ndegree\nsynoptophore fusion slides that ranged in angular size from 2\no\nto 12\no\n.\nSubjects were presented with pairs of slides and asked about features from both the\nfellow eye (FE) and amblyopic eye (AE). Illuminance adjustments were then made with\na goal of establishing simultaneous vision. This was determined in one of several\nways. Subjects reported when the AE's image was easier to \"focus on\" or \"attend to\"\nor see both its image and the FE's image \"with equal ease.\" To achieve simultaneous\nvision, the illuminance for the AE was increased and/or the FE's was decreased. Both\neyes started with a setting of 5, the instrument's midpoint, and the AE's rheostat\nwas increased by integer steps until a higher setting was rejected. Then the FE's\nrheostat was decreased by integer steps until a lower setting was rejected. The resultant\nsettings were used to calculate the Illuminance Balance, a quantitative measure for\nsuppression.\nResults: The Illuminance Balance was determined for a total of nine conditions in eight adults\n(age range: 19-39 years old) with unilateral amblyopia. VA of the AE ranged from +0.24\nto +0.78 logMAR. The mechanism for amblyopia was anisometropic, strabismic, or a combination\nof the two. Subjects were tested with lenses in place that best corrected for the\nfull amount of anisometropia, as determined by a cycloplegic retinoscopy completed\nat a prior visit, to reduce the impact of uncorrected refractive error. We found the\naverage Illuminance Balance increased as interocular VA difference increased (Pearson\ncorrelation; p = 0.027; r\n2\n= 0.585).\nConclusion: The synoptophore is an accessible instrument that provides for extensive manipulation\nof stimuli for measuring binocular anomalies. It provides a clinical assessment that\ncan quantify various aspects of binocular vision, including suppression, a basis for\nsensory eye dominance. In the present study, we were able to quantify suppression\nand based on the quantification, noted a trend where subjects with greater interocular\nVA difference also demonstrated greater suppression.","title":"Using the Synoptophore to Quantify Interocular Suppression in Amblyopia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180091\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Krista Roberts, Teng-Leng Ooi\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University, The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

One\ntype of imbalance results in strong suppression of the fellow eye (FE) on the amblyopic\neye (AE), causing poor binocular vision. This can be revealed by presenting a typical\nbinocular rivalry (BR) stimulus (Fig 1a) to the amblyopic patient. He/she would report\nseeing the image in the FE almost exclusively with some fleeting perception of the\nimage from the AE. In contrast, an observer with normal vision would experience roughly\nequal chance of seeing the image from each eye. This observation gives credence to\nthe time-honored practice of implementing anti-suppression training, which emphasizes\nthe rebalancing of interocular inhibition. But to monitor progress during treatment\nrequires a sensitive test to quantitatively measure the extent of AE's suppression.\nSuch a test needs to overcome the challenge of the AE's fleeting ability to suppress\nthe FE. We designed one such test using a BR stimulus that favored one eye.\nMethods: Unlike the typical BR stimulus comprising vertical and horizontal grating discs (Fig\n1a), we used a design where only one eye's half-image carried the vertical grating\ndisc target (Fig 1b). The other eye's half-image had horizontal grating and no disc.\nBR readily occurs between the dissimilar gratings, with the stimulus strength of the\neye receiving the contoured disc being substantially increased (Ooi & He, 2006). Here,\nwe capitalized on this advantage by presenting the half-image with the disc to the\nAE to augment its inhibition on the FE. We tested adult amblyopes (n=4) of anisometropic\nand/or strabismic origins. They viewed the new BR stimulus for 60 sec and reported\nif they saw more vertical or horizontal gratings (3 cpd & 35 cd/m\n2\n). The\norientation of the disc grating was orthogonal to the surrounding grating (0\no\nor 90\no\n). As control, we tested observers with normal vision (n=5).\nResults: We calculated the predominance of seeing the image with the grating disc. The mean\npredominance for the normal observers, who had little interocular imbalance, was 86.6%±3.8%\nno matter which eye was tested. This indicates the BR half-image with the disc, having\nhigher stimulus strength, led to the eye viewing it being dominant more often (>50%).\nFor the amblyopic observers, the FE's predominance ranged from 81.2% to 100% (mean=95.9%±3.0%),\nwhile the AE's predominance ranged from 25.6% to 44.7% (mean=33.9%±3.0%) (t-test,\np<.001).\nConclusion: The lower predominance of the AE compared to the control reflects the increased suppression\nof the AE, which nevertheless we were able to quantify by using a stimulus that augmented\nits ability to dominate over the FE. We attach a special significance to our BR stimulus\nas a similar stimulus has been shown to preferentially activate the ocular dominance\ncolumns of the eye viewing the disc in cortical area V1 of macaque monkeys (Xu, Han\net al, 2016).","title":"A Novel Binocular Rivalry Stimulus for Measuring Interocular Suppression in Amblyopia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180092\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Chao Han, Maureen Plaumann, Zijiang He\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry, University of Louisville\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, amblyopia is associated with oculomotor control deficits that\naffect the two eyes differently and that are independent from the sensory loss. These\ndeficits may interfere with OKN measures. Previous studies of OKN in amblyopia have\nused monocular eye movement recordings and therefore conjugacy of the OKN response\nis unknown. We addressed this issue by recording binocular eye movements during monocular\ninduction of OKN and measuring the conjugacy of quick-phase (QP) amplitudes.\nMethods: Data are reported as mean ± SE. Participants with amblyopia (n = 8; 37.8 ± 6.5 years;\namblyopic eye (AE) acuity = 0.43 ± 0.09 logMAR; fellow eye (FE) = - 0.07 ± 0.14 logMAR)\nand normal vision (n = 14; 26.6 ± 1.6 years; right eye (RE) = - 0.09 ± 0.02 logMAR;\nleft eye (LE) = - 0.12 ± 0.03 logMAR) completed the study. Eye movements were recorded\nat 500 Hz via head-mounted infrared (IR) oculography (Eyelink II), while participants\nviewed a drifting square-wave grating (100% contrast, 10\no\nx 10\no\n,\nfundamental frequency 0.5 cpd, 10\no\n/s, 50 cm viewing distance). The stimulus\nwas viewed monocularly with each eye while eye movements were recorded binocularly\nwith an IR-passing filter placed over the non-viewing eye. Stimulus direction was\nrandomized (nasal or temporal) over six, 15-second trials. A conjugacy index was defined\nby subtracting QP amplitudes in the AE from the FE in the amblyopia group, and the\nRE from the LE in controls. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA.\nResults: There was a high degree of conjugacy in adults with amblyopia irrespective of which\neye was viewing. There was no significant difference in conjugacy between the amblyopia\nand control groups (p = 0.34) and no interaction between viewing eye and grating direction\nin the amblyopia group (p = 0.78). The conjugacy index did not differ from zero in\nany condition (p > 0.20).\nConclusion: OKN conjugacy is normal in amblyopia, supporting the use of OKN to measure visual\nfunction.

The purpose of this study was to determine if\nfixation stability improved in patients with amblyopia who had standard amblyopia\ntherapy which resulted in an improvement in acuity.\nMethods: Eight adult patients (age range 18 - 60; average 34.5 ± 16.66) with amblyopia (BCVA\n20/40 or worse) due to anisometropia (N = 3) or anisometropia and strabismus (N =\n5) were enrolled in the study. The patients received a comprehensive eye examination\nand wore their best correction for at least four weeks prior to baseline testing to\nensure adaptation. They were instructed to patch their non-amblyopic eye for 2 hours\nper day. While patching, they were to perform near training exercises on the Amblyopia\niNET program for 30 minutes and do any near work for the remaining 1.5 hours. The\npatients had a baseline amblyopia evaluation and came in for 12 weekly study visits,\nat which time their visual acuity was measured with the E-ETDRS protocol. At 12 weeks,\nthe treatment was tapered off over one month and the patients came in for a final\namblyopia evaluation at 24 weeks. Fixation stability was determined for the amblyopic\neye with the Tobii TX300 eye tracker at baseline and week 24. The patients monocularly\nfixated the center of an \"X\" (2\no\nvertical height) for 60 seconds. The bivariate\ncontour ellipse area (BCEA in deg\n2\n= Ï€Ï‡\n2\nÏƒ\nx\nÏƒ\ny\n(1-Ï\n2\n)\n1/2\n)\nwas determined for 10 seconds of the fixation data beginning at 1 second after the\ntrial start. The Chi-squared value (Ï‡\n2\n) corresponded to a probability of\n0.95.\nResults: The amblyopia therapy resulted in a significant improvement in visual acuity (paired\nt-test, p = 0.016). The average acuity improvement for the 8 patients over the 24\nweeks was about 8 letters or 1.8 logMAR lines. The averaged (SD) BCEAs at baseline\nand week 24 for all of the patients were not significantly different (p = 0.072, t\n= 2.12; 6.02 ± 3.96 and 3.00 ± 1.90, respectively). The averaged (SD) BCEAs at baseline\nand week 24 for the patients (N = 5) that exhibited an increase in acuity of 5 letters\nor more were also not significantly different (p = 0.196, t = 1.55; 6.09 ± 5.23 and\n2.79 ± 0.63, respectively).\nConclusion: The amblyopia therapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in visual\nacuity but not fixation stability. The large variability in the data and the small\nsample size may be responsible for the lack of a statistically significant change\nin fixation stability.","title":"Effect of Amblyopia Therapy on Fixation Stability","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180095\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        So.

Here we attempt to deduce how cone signals combine within\nthe receptive fields of LGN neurons in the presence of ongoing visual stimulation.\nUnderstanding the elementary operations performed by visual circuits has fundamental\nimplications for knowing how pathology of the visual system disrupts normal physiologic\nretinal processing.\nMethods: An adaptive optics based retinal microstimulator was used to present binarized white-noise\nmovies onto the retina where the receptive fields of LGN neurons had been located\nwithin 1\no\nfrom the fovea. Extracellular recordings of neuron action potentials\nwere made in an adult macaque undergoing anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade. Movies\nwere presented at 30 Hz using real-time stabilization to ensure that stimuli were\nfixed at one locus on the retina. Movies were ~10 arcmin wide, with a spatial pixel\nresolution of ~19 arcsec, and used 543 nm light (chosen for its ability to drive M\nand L cones equally). Spike probability was analyzed to determine how summation of\ncone signals modulated the LGN responses. Receptive fields were revealed by spike-triggered\naveraging of the stimulus movies. In these parafoveal receptive fields, single stimulus\npixels covered an area of one or two cones. For spike analysis, single pixels and\ncombination of pixels at least one cone's width apart were selected to assess summation.\nResults: Responses of 3 parvocellular ON cells in the LGN of an adult macaque were analyzed\nfor changes in spike probability when selected cones were stimulated in the midst\nof continuously presented white-noise movies. In these cells, brighter than average\npixels landing within the receptive field increased spike probability by an average\nof 15%, while bright pixels landing on spatially separated pairs raised firing probability\nby 33%, yielding an average predicted:measured ratio of 0.92 ± 0.02 SD, suggesting\nnear linear summation. At the same sites, when darker than average pixels were presented,\nspike probability changed by -15% in all three cells with pairs summing to -27%, giving\na ratio of 1.1 ± .04 SD. When testing the condition in which two pixels had opposite\nvalences (one bright, one dark), spike probability remained effectively unchanged,\nsuggesting that the cone signals canceled one another and therefore confirmed that\nthe signals summed arithmetically.\nConclusion: Cone signal summation within an LGN receptive field center can be approximately linear\nduring ongoing stimulation. Linear summation occurs independently of valence and is\nevident through combinatoric increases and decreases in spike probability.","title":"Cone Signal Arithmetic in Macaque LGN Neurons","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180097\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Philipp Tellers, Lawrence Sincich\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

This study aimed to explore the effects\nof an awareness tool for safe and responsible driving (OSCAR) on (1) interest, openness\nand knowledge of safe driving; (2) awareness of changes in driving abilities; and\n(3) use of compensatory strategies in seniors with and without age-related macular\ndegeneration (AMD).\nMethods: A preexperimental study, with pretest (T\n0\n) and posttest (T\n1\n),\nwas conducted with 50 experimented drivers older than 60 years (30 without AMD and\n20 with AMD). At T\n0\n, participants were asked to answer three questionnaires:\n1) Interest, Openness and Knowledge (IOK), 2) Changes Occurred in driving Abilities\n(COA) and 3) Utilization of Compensatory Strategies (UCS). Afterwards, the participants\nreceived an intervention about safe and responsible driving: OSCAR. The tool was read\nand commented by a research assistant. A copy of OSCAR was given to all participants\nto consult at home. Eight weeks after the intervention (T\n1\n), the participants\nanswered the same questionnaires (IOK, COA and UCS). The scores before (T\n0\n)\nand after (T\n1\n) the intervention were compared as well as between the two\ngroups (repeated measures ANOVA).\nResults: Binocular visual acuity of the group without AMD was - 0.14 (± .07) logMAR with habitual\ncorrections and stereoacuity was 24.8 (± 8.8) sec. of arc. Binocular visual acuity\nwas - 0.04 (± .10) logMAR with habitual corrections for the group with AMD and stereoacuity\nwas 78.0 (± 72.5) sec. of arc. Concerning the intervention, the results showed a positive\nimpact of OSCAR. There was a main effect of time for the three questionnaires (IOK,\nCOA, USC) (p ? .001). However, improvements in mean scores were statistically\nsignificantly greater for the group without AMD for two questionnaires: IOK and UCS\n(p ? .01). These differences between the two groups could be explained by higher\nstarting scores (T\n0\n) in the group with AMD.\nConclusion: OSCAR can improve interest, openness and knowledge about safe driving and awareness\nof the limits of driving for seniors as well as enhance use of compensatory strategies.\nThe presence of an eye disease could increase awareness of changes in one's abilities\nand generate a form of self-regulation of one's driving. This may explain a greater\ninterest in driving, better knowledge of road safety and more use of compensatory\nstrategies pre-intervention for the group with AMD compared to the group without AMD.","title":"Effects of an Awareness Tool for Safe and Responsible Driving Differences Between  Elders with and Without AMD","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180088\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Elise Luthun, Marie-Julie Rivest, Sebastien Olivier, Jocelyn Faubert, Melanie Levasseur\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, Institut Nazareth et Louis-Braille, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

SES was\nrepresented as a categorical variable based on highest level of reported educational\nachievement. ANOVA and Fisher's Exact Tests were used to examine the relationships\namong visual acuity, SES, and uncorrected refractive error.\nResults: Fifty-nine people with AMD (42% female, mean±SD age of 82 ± 9 years) were recruited\nfrom The Ohio State University Department of Ophthalmology retina service. Better\neye visual acuity ranged from 3 to 85 letters (mean±SD=58 ± 23). Thirty-one percent\nof subjects reported a high school diploma or less, and 32% reported an advanced degree.\nPeople with a high school diploma or less had mean visual acuity of 48 ± 28 letters;\nthose with an advanced degree had mean visual acuity of 65 ± 16 letters. Thirty-two\npercent of people had an improvement in VA with auto-refraction compared to habitual\ncorrection, and 23% of people did not habitually wear spectacles. People without habitual\nspectacles were more likely to improve with autorefraction as compared to those wearing\ncorrection (p=0.046). However, level of education was not associated with dioptric\ndifference between habitual correction and autorefraction in this sample (p=0.764),\nand the percentage of subjects without habitual spectacles was similar among different\nlevels of education.\nConclusion: The increased likelihood of visual acuity improvement in patients with AMD who do\nnot wear spectacles is consistent with the hypothesis that some of the previously-determined\nrelationship between SES and vision may be due to uncorrected refractive error. However,\nother potential mediating factors including differences in health behaviors, diet,\nand access to transportation, may also play a role and should be investigated in the\nfuture.","title":"Socioeconomic Status and Uncorrected Refractive Error in Agerelated Macular Degeneration","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180083\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        San-San Cooley, Frederick Davidorf, Bradley Dougherty\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University, The Ohio State University, The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

But there\nappears to be a subjective and visual component of time, based on environmental stimulation\nand neural processing. Our internal perception of time or temporal processing takes\nplace across a network of neural regions derived from spatial vectors in the visual\ncortex, cerebellum, superior temporal gyrus and motor cortex (Stentson, 2006, Ivry\n& Spencer, 2004). Eagleman et. al demonstrated the illusory distortion of time by\npresenting repetitive visual stimulus with the inclusion of a single different or\n\"oddball\" stimulus. Subjects felt the nonstandard stimulus was displayed for a greater duration\ndespite all images being viewed for an equal amount of time. Visual input, even at\nlow levels, allows for this predictive coding (R Schindel, 2011) which shapes how\nwe experience time. But what happens when visual input is degraded, and we must rely\non our other senses? This study was designed to measure accuracy of auditory and internal\ntemporal processing among a low vision population.\nMethods: Subjects performed two tasks related to temporal processing. Evaluating auditory temporal\nprocessing, subjects were presented a series of nine standard beeps for a duration\nof 1 second (500Hz), and a randomly inserted \"oddball\" beep for a duration of 1 second\n(1000Hz). Subjects were asked if they heard an oddball beep and if so, was it shorter,\nthe same length or longer than the nine standard beeps. Secondarily we measured internal\ntemporal processing by having subjects close their eyes and state when they perceived\n10 seconds had passed while the investigator used a stop watch to measure the elapsed\ntime.\nResults: For our cohort (n=30), subjects were separated based on visual acuities into a control\ngroup (n=15, 0.01logMAR) and visually impaired (n=15, 0.9logMAR). For the purposes\nof this study visually impaired was determined to be logMAR acuity of 0.2 or worse.\nOver half of the visually impaired subejcts (60%) perceived the \"odd ball\" beep (1000Hz) to be shorter in duration as compared to 20% of the control group.\nWhen the beep was presented in the series (6th, 7th or 9th) was not significant. The\ninternalized temporal processing of 10 seconds for the visually impaired group was\n1.87 seconds shorter (8.41s vs 10.28s), when compared to the normally sighted population\n(t=2.24, p =0.016). This was found to be statistically significant.\nConclusion: The visually impaired group were more likely to experience a compressed perception\nof time for the auditory task and internal temporal processing task, as compared to\nthe control group. These findings may highlight the effect reduced sensory information\nhas on temporal processing.","title":"Evaluating the Effects of Vision Loss on Temporal Processing Among a Low Vision Cohort","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180084\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jacqueline Balderas\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}
{"_type":"dict","author":"Eli Peli","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/high-power-multiperiscopic-device-for-field-expansion","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: We have developed a series of field expansion devices using prisms and evaluated their\nimpact on patients with visual field loss including: peripheral field loss (PFL) and\nhomonymous hemianopia (HH). We recently reported that the risk of a collision with\nother pedestrians (a common complaint) peaks when the other pedestrian is at 45° eccentricity\n(Peli et al., JoV 2016). However, field expansion with current peripheral Fresnel\nprism glasses is limited to about 30° (57Î”). The shifted view through these high power\nprisms is distorted (minified), of low contrast, and dim. Due to total internal reflection,\nconventional prisms limit the effective range of eye scanning to only 5° into the\nblind field. We invented a novel field expansion device, multi-periscopic prism (MPP),\nto overcome these limitations.\nMethods: MPP is a cascade of half-penta prisms (commonly used in binoculars), which use double\nreflection rather than refraction to shift a wide scene from the blind side by 45°\ntowards the seeing side with minimal loss of image quality. While MPP configuration\nfor HH is similar to the conventional peripheral prism configuration, we developed\ntwo new configurations (peripheral and lateral) for PFL to support detection of potential\ncollisions with other pedestrians. The peripheral configuration has one MPP above\nthe residual field on one lens and one below on the other lens, both in base-out.\nThe lateral configuration places both base-out MPPs temporal to the pupil on both\nlenses, elongated vertically allowing unimpeded downward eye scanning, to detect floor-level\ntripping hazards while maintaining lateral field expansion. We constructed MPP prototypes\nusing 3D-printed holders to cascade half-penta prisms and mount them in front of the\nspectacle lenses, to benefit from the refractive correction.\nResults: The MPP prototypes demonstrate a 45° shift (100Î”, 50% over conventional 57Î” prisms)\nand permit up to 15° effective eye scanning range into the blind field (3 times wider\nthan conventional 57Î” prisms), enlarging the coverage of collision detection particularly\nfor PFL. The large angle shift was demonstrated in perimetry with patients and the\ndramatically improved image quality (high contrast, less distortion and color dispersion)\nis illustrated using a special camera with accurate field presentation.\nConclusion: Using MPP, patients with visual field loss should be able to detect other pedestrians\nat eccentricities corresponding to the peak of the collision risk, while drivers with\nHH may be able to detect hazards at intersections where wider field and larger eye\nscanning range are required. The provision of carrier optical correction further improves\nimage quality.","title":"High Power MultiPeriscopic Device for Field Expansion","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180085\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jae-Hyun Jung, Nish Mohith Kurukuti, Fernando Vargas Martin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School, Universidad de Murcia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Surprisingly, however, contrast sensitivity (CS) is not considered for licensure,\ndespite evidence that it may be a better predictor of crash risk than VA. Two experiments\nwere conducted to investigate how simulated reductions in VA and CS selectively affect\nthe detection of pedestrians in a driving simulator.\nMethods: Young normally-sighted current drivers (n = 30) wore goggles simulating different\nlevels of VA and CS loss (within a range that would meet criteria either for a unrestricted\nor a restricted license VA 20/30 to 20/100). They drove along predetermined routes\nin a highway setting. Pedestrian hazards (n = 12 per condition) on a collision course\nappeared on the right or left and ran toward the road as if to cross in front of the\ncar. Participants responded by pressing the horn as soon as a pedestrian was detected.\nEvents were categorised as a potential collision if the participant did not respond\nwith sufficient time to have been able to execute a safe braking maneuver in the real\nworld.\nResults: Pedestrian detection rates were very high (> 95%) and did not differ across the\nvarious VA and CS conditions. Reducing VA alone had no significant effects on either\nreaction time or the proportion of potential collisions. By comparison, however, reducing\nCS significantly increased both reaction time (p < 0.001) and the proportion of\npotential collisions (p = 0.01). There were no significant interactions between VA\nand CS on response time and potential collisions.To determine whether CS, VA, or a\ncombination of CS and VA best predicted detection performance, model comparison was\nused to compare four regression models. The CS-alone model performed better than a\nVA-alone model and did not differ from a model that included both VA and CS; this\nwas true for both response times and the proportion of potential collisions.\nConclusion: These results suggest that an individual's CS should be considered when determining\nvisual fitness to drive, especially in the early stages of ocular disease, such as\ncataract, where CS may be impaired while high contrast VA is still relatively unimpaired.","title":"Contrast Sensitivity Losses Impair Pedestrian Detection More than Visual Acuity Losses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180086\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Maha Shahin, Jacqueline Albert, Joseph Herrmann, Garrett Swan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Mansoura University, Southern California College of Optometry, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Schepens Eye Research Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

The detection time, in seconds,\nwas defined as the duration between the time when the subject first indicated seeing\nthe approaching vehicle to when that vehicle reached the subject. Subjects performed\nthis task monocularly while fixating centrally with their habitual, normal vision\nand when fixating with a simulated central scotoma in one of four directions: centrally,\nusing a right-field preferred retinal locus (PRL), left-field PRL and a superior-field\nPRL. The simulated central scotoma was induced using a centrally-opaque contact lens\n(CL) and the order of testing with and without the simulated scotoma was counter-balanced\nacross subjects. The order in which subjects fixated with the simulated scotoma was\ninterleaved within the scotoma session in the following order: central, right-, left-\nand superior-field PRL.

Studies in animals have shown the effectiveness of caffeine\nin slowing myopia progression, which might involve the ipRGC mediated pathways. Caffeine\nis an adenosine receptor blocker in the central and autonomous nervous systems. Studies\nshow that pharmacological blockade of adenosine receptors in the mammalian retina\nreduces light response of ipRGCs. The goal of this study was to determine the short\nterm effects of oral caffeine on the ipRGC-driven pupil responses in adult subjects.\nMethods: Healthy subjects (n = 13), ages 21 to 42 years (mean 28.41 ± 5.23 SD) participated\nin two experimental conditions, ingestion of either a 200 mg caffeine pill or a placebo\npill. Subjects were blinded to the condition, which was randomized and tested at least\none week. All sessions started at 9:00 am to minimize the influence of diurnal variation.\nSubjects dark adapted for 5 minutes, and pupil responses were measured at baseline,\nand 1 and 4 hours after ingesting the pill. Stimuli included six 1 second (s) pulses\n(alternating long (651 nm, 33.3 cd/m\n2\n) and short (456 nm, 16.67 cd/m\n2\n)\nwavelengths) presented 60 s apart with a ganzfeld stimulator to the left eye, while\npupil diameter was measured in the right eye with an infrared camera at 60 Hz. Minimum\npupil size, the 6 s and 30 s post-illumination response (PIPR), and area under the\ncurve (AUC) were calculated and averaged for the 3 long and 3 short wavelength stimuli\nat each time point. Metrics were calculated relative to baseline pupil size.\nResults: For both long and short wavelength stimuli, baseline pupil sizes, minimum pupil size,\nand PIPR metrics were similar between the placebo and caffeine conditions (paired\nt-test, p > 0.05 for all). Within each condition, there were no differences between\nat 1 and 4 hours compared to baseline (repeated measures ANOVA, p > 0.05 for all).\nFor short wavelength stimuli, minimum pupil size at the 3 time points for the placebo\ncondition were 0.52 ± 0.06, 0.51 ± 0.08, and 0.54 ± 0.06, and for the caffeine condition\nwere 0.52 ± 0.07, 0.52 ± 0.06, and 0.51 ± 0.07. The 6 s PIPR at the 3 time points\nfor the placebo condition were 0.79 ± 0.08, 0.76 ± 0.1, and 0.79 ± 0.08, and for the\ncaffeine condition were 0.77 ± 0.01, 0.77 ± 0.07, and 0.78 ± 0.08.\nConclusion: Our findings show that an acute administration of 200 mg oral caffeine does not alter\nthe ipRGC-driven pupil response. It is possible that at this dose, the drug is not\nreaching the retina within the time assessed. Further studies using a topical ophthalmic\nsolution of caffeine, providing a more direct route to the retina, may further elucidate\nthe effects of adenosine receptors in modulating ipRGC function.","title":"Effects of Oral Caffeine Pills on the Melanopsin Driven Pupil Response","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180078\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Hope Queener, Lisa Ostrin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Thickness measurements were recorded\nas 64 individual measurements within an 8 Ã— 8 grid over the macula and assessed against\npreviously published normative values. Vascular density was assessed across the ETDRS\ngrid. Seventeen eyes which had both scans were used to spatially correlate GCL and\nSCP changes.\nResults: Inner retinal structure was significantly altered in AMD with 39.2% of AMD\neyes exhibited at least one location of GCL thickening, 19.6% exhibited at least one\nlocation of GCL thinning, and 15.7% exhibited locations with both thinning and thickening.\nThe majority of abnormal locations were within the central 12 grid squares or the\ninferotemporal macula. Inner retinal vasculature on the other hand altered throughout\nthe retina with decreased vascular density in all ETDRS grid locations in AMD eyes.\nPost-hoc analysis indicated a significant location based difference in the outer superior\nsubfield only (4.87% decrease in vascular density; p < 0.05). FAZ area also showed\na significant increase in eyes with higher risk of progression (based on AREDS progression\nrisk). Associations between the two measures found a weak, non-significant correlation\nbetween GCL thickness and SCP vascular density changes (r: 0.37, p = 0.14).\nConclusion: Significant, localised changes in GCL thickness and widespread vascular density changes\nin SCP can be detected in AMD eyes in vivo using OCT and OCTA and may be associated\nwith AMD progression. This suggests clinical assessment of the early stages of AMD\nshould not be limited to the outer retina.","title":"Correlating Changes in Inner Retinal Structure and Vasculature in Intermediate AgeRelated  Macular Degeneration AMD Using OCT and OCTA","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180079\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Georgina Uttley, Nicholas Tan, Nayuta Yoshioka, Agnes Choi, Michael Kalloniatis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia, Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia, Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia, Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia, Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Sensitive methods to detect disease progression may improve\noutcomes for these patients. In AMD, it has been established that contrast sensitivity\nfunction worsens with increasing drusen accumulation and progression of disease. The\nKing-Devick Variable Color Contrast Sensitivity Chart is an iOS platform application\nthat offers portable tablet availability, variable contrast levels as well as color\ncontrast presentations to allow simultaneous assessment of visual acuity, contrast\nsensitivity and color vision.\nThis study aimed to determine which color contrast\nsensitivity differences exist in exudative AMD (E-AMD) compared to control and non-exudative\nAMD (NE-AMD) to develop a baseline for utilizing this technology in detecting AMD\nprogression. This potential detection could result in earlier treatment and decreased\nprogression of the disease before irreversible damage to sight occurs.\nMethods: All study procedures were approved by the Illinois College of Optometry Institutional\nReview Board and written informed consent was obtained from each study participant.\nPatients from the Illinois Eye Institute and Chicago Eye Institute were recruited\nto perform a color contrast sensitivity test. Participants were excluded if there\nwas any presence of macular pathology other than AMD or visually significant cataracts.\nIn a single study visit, monocular best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 40cm with\n100% black contrast was determined. Utilizing the BCVA line, the number of letters\ncorrectly identified (out of 5) was recorded for various color presentations (blue,\nyellow) and at decreasing contrast levels (75%, 50%, 25%). Accuracy of the patients\nnear visual acuity was recorded as both color and contrast changed.\nResults: The control group (n=58) mean age 60.7 ±7.6 years (41% female). The NE-AMD (n=34)\nage 76.7 ± 10.5 years (74% female). The E-AMD (n=17) mean age 77.4 ± 10.7 years (65%\nfemale). A significant decrease in vision was noted in E-AMD patients for black 100%\ncontrast (C/NE-AMD: mean + 0.34 ± 0.3 LogMAR vs E-AMD: mean + 1.02 ± 0.5 LogMAR p<0.0001)\nand blue 50% ( C/NE-AMD: mean 4.29 letters ± 1.8 vs E-AMD: mean 3.75 letters ± 1.0\np<0.046) contrast letters when compared to the control and NE-AMD.\nConclusion: Our results show greater variability in color vision and color contrast in E-AMD patients\ncompared to healthy controls and NE-AMD. Specifically, blue at 50% seems to be more\ndifficult for patients with E-AMD. Further testing with a larger sample size of E-AMD\npatients may yield more significant differences in other color contrast settings.\nIf a specific color and contrast threshold can be identified, it may be possible to\ndevelop tools to diagnose progression to E-AMD at an earlier stage and promptly initiate\neffective treatment.","title":"Color Contrast Sensitivity in AgeRelated Macular Degeneration","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180081\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jessica Capri, Anya Hariprasad, Leonard Messner, Danielle Leong\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Illinois College of Optometry, University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Illinois College of Optometry, Illinois College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Each visit\nwas scheduled at the same time of day to control for diurnal variation. At each visit,\nsubjects wore best correction OU (determined by manifest refraction) and one of three\ntest lenses OD, in random order. The test lenses were: a full-field +3.00 D lens,\na bipartite plano/+3.00 D lens, and a bipartite plano/-3.00 D lens (with the +/-3.00\nD bipartite lenses oriented to induce defocus on the temporal retina). Choroidal thickness\nand area were determined from B-scan images using previously validated semi-automated\nimage segmentation software. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze 1-hour regional\nchanges in choroidal area of each eye (test eye and control eye) at each visit. To\nevaluate the effect of the full-field +3 lens, the 1-hour change in choroidal thickness\nat the central point (0°) of all 31 B-scans and the change in choroidal area for the\ncentral 13° of each B-scan were analyzed for the test and control eye. The effect\nof exposure to the bipartite lenses were quantified by calculating the 1-hour change\nin choroidal area of the temporal half of the B-scan for the test versus control eye\nat each visit. Based on the published repeatability of our segmentation methods, this\nstudy was powered to detect a change in choroidal thickness as small as 8 Î¼m at an\nalpha of 0.05 with 80% power.\nResults: Subjects' (24 ± 2 years) mean spherical equivalent refractive error OD was -3.52 ±\n2.57 D (range: +1.75 to -9.00 D).

Therefore in this study, we aimed to\nexamine the topographical thickness characteristics of the retina and choroid into\nperipheral regions of myopic and emmetropic eyes using wide-field spectral domain\noptical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).\nMethods: Thirty two healthy young adults aged 18-25 (19 myopes with mean spherical equivalent\nof -2.29 ± 2.05 D and 13 emmetropes with mean spherical equivalent of -0.07 ± 0.23\nD) had measures of retinal and choroidal thickness collected across a panoramic region\nusing enhanced depth imaging SD-OCT coupled with a wide-field objective lens. Each\nsubject had 5 volumetric wide-field (55°) OCT scans captured from 5 different but\noverlapping retinal locations. Custom written software was then used to montage together\nthese overlapping scans to create panoramic retinal and choroidal thickness maps for\neach subject, extending out to ~18 mm from the fovea into the periphery.

In this cohort of young adults, the strongest association between\nretinal and choroidal thinning and axial elongation was observed in more peripheral\nregions.","title":"Mapping Peripheral Retinal and Choroidal Thickness in Myopia","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180076\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Queensland University of Technology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        David Alonso-Caneiro, Emily Pieterse, Pei-Yu Chang, Chen-Pang Chiang, Richard Hoang, Brian Toh, Chia-Chen Tsai, Chia-Jun Tu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Queensland University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

The role of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)\nin illuminance detection and dopamine release suggests that ipRGCs may play a role\nin this process. A prior study demonstrated that changes in ipRGC-driven pupil responses\nto multiple red and blue stimuli differed as a function of axial length between myopic\nand non-myopic children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether this effect\nvaries based upon season.\nMethods: Subjects were 50 children aged 8-17 years (average age 11.5 ± 2.7 years, 32 females)\nwith spherical equivalent (SEQ) refractive error between +1.51 and -5.69 diopters\n(non-cycloplegic autorefraction). The IOLMaster was used to measure axial length.\nSubjects were exposed to three different protocols where full-field stimuli oscillated\nbetween colored light and dark at 0.1 Hz in the following order: 1) alternating red\nand blue, 2) red-only, and 3) blue-only. The RAPDx pupilometer was used to measure\npupil size. Twenty-six of the subjects were tested during the summer months (June-August),\nwith the other twenty-four tested during the winter months (January-March). The primary\noutcome measure was the average difference in normalized pupil size between blue and\nred stimulation.\nResults: Pupils tended to become smaller during blue stimulation than during red stimulation.\nThe difference in these pupil sizes varied significantly by the season in which testing\noccurred. During the summer months, the pupil size difference between blue and red\nstimulation was greater than during the winter months (p<0.0001). The association\nbetween this pupil outcome and axial length was also modified by the season in which\ntesting occurred. During the summer months, subjects with shorter axial lengths showed\na greater difference in pupil size between blue and red stimulation than did subjects\nwith longer axial lengths (slope = -0.019, p = 0.006). During the winter months, this\nassociation was not present (slope = -0.001, p = 0.90). Additionally, although subjects\nwith less myopic refractive error tended to have larger differences in pupil size\nbetween blue and red stimulation, this effect did not reach statistical significance\nin either season (slope = 0.006, p = 0.073).\nConclusion: During the summer months, subjects with shorter axial lengths experienced smaller\npupils during blue stimulation and larger pupils during red stimulation. A potential\nexplanation for this effect is increased summer light exposure causing more robust\nipRGC-dependent pupil responses. These findings support the hypothesis that an adaptive\nipRGC-driven dopaminergic pathway may exist where shorter eyes take advantage of greater\nlight exposure to further inhibit the growth of the eye to reduce the risk of the\nonset of myopic refractive error.","title":"The Association Between Axial Length and Pupil Responses to Blue and Red Stimuli in  Children Depends on Season","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180077\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Hartwick, Donald Mutti\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Donovan et al published a meta-analysis of refractive progression\namong myopes;\n1\nhowever, axial length may be a preferred metric to refractive\nerror for assessing myopia as\n(i) it is significantly associated with retinal\ndisease,\n(ii) its measurement is more repeatable (in relative terms) and\n(iii)\nit can be obtained without cycloplegia.\nWe conducted a meta-analysis to model\naxial elongation in myopic children.\nMethods: A search using PubMed and Embase, based on the following search terms [\"myopi* AND\n((axial AND (length OR elongation)) OR biometr*) AND (progression OR shift OR longitudinal)\nNOT (animal OR surgery OR surgical OR adult)], yielded 269 results. Data from 63 eligible\nstudies was available after eliminating reviews, studies without progression data\nspecifically for myopes in the age range of 7 to 18 years and papers with redundant\ninformation or other sundry issues, and adding studies cross-referenced in the papers\nsurveyed. To account for varying ages of sample populations and different periods\nof follow-up, instantaneous axial elongation rate was modeled using the integral of\nthe exponential decay function based on the following equation:\nAE\nt,t'\n= (e\nÎ»t'\n- e\nÎ»t\n) * Î±/Î», where AE\nt,t'\nis measured axial elongation between ages t and t' and Î± and\nÎ» are fitted constants. A procedure was developed to score race in different\nstudies with ethnicity, country of residence and proportional representation in studies\ntaken into account.\nResults: Graph A of the figure plots adjusted residuals after modeling instantaneous rate of\naxial elongation (mm/yr) by age and race (see caption for details). 79% of measured\nvalues fall within ± 0.10 mm of fitted values. Graph B plots the model (R\n2\n= 0.82). Asian children show about 44% greater rate of elongation than non-Asians\nacross age despite independence of fit of the decay functions. A 9yo Asian child is\npredicted to have instantaneous progression of 0.41 mm/yr compared with 0.28 mm/yr\nfor a 9yo white child. These rates of axial elongation are generally compatible with\nrefractive progression curves of Donovan et al\n1\n, although differences between\nAsian and non-Asian children are greater than expected.\nConclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of axial elongation in myopic children.\nAxial length measurement is expected to become an increasing part of clinical practice\nas myopia control becomes more widely accepted. Our model provides a useful referent\nfor practitioners when assessing myopic progression in children and may assist in\nsetting efficacy criteria for myopia control products. Future work will identify important\ncovariates beyond race and age, the change in the axial length/refractive error ratio\nand progression rates during various forms of myopia control treatment.\n1.\nDonovan et al, Optom Vis Sci 2012; 89: 27.","title":"Influence of Age and Race on Axial Elongation in Myopic Children","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180072\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Johnson & Johnson Vision\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Xu Cheng, Youssef Toubouti, Mark Bullimore\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Johnson & Johnson Vision, Johnson & Johnson Vision, Marshall B.

The purpose\nof this study is to exam longitudinal changes in retinal thickness and shape in a\npopulation of children with myopia.\nMethods: 87 subjects ages 5-12 (mean 10.8) were imaged for this study using thirty degree SD\nOCT images (Spectralis, Heidleberg.)

While\nthe mechanism of this response is still unclear, it is thought that axial elongation\nand an exaggerated prolate shape of the globe results from a local retinal reaction\nto hyperopic blur in the periphery as part of a visual feedback mechanism. The aim\nof this study was to investigate these local retinal changes in developing human eyes\nin vivo by quantifying cone density and comparing it to refractive error and\naxial length as a measure of retinal stretch.\nMethods: This study investigated 6 children 10-17 years of age (10 eyes total) with normal\ncolor vision and no manifest ocular disease other than refractive error. Axial length\nand refractive error were measured at the fovea, 25° temporal (T), 13° T, 15° nasal\n(N), 25° N, and 24.5° superior (S) using a Lenstar biometer and a Grand Seiko auto\nrefractor with modified fixation targets for peripheral measurements. Cone imaging\nwas performed using a custom-built adaptive optics - scanning laser ophthalmoscope\nsystem at each of the 6 locations, with the addition of 10° N and 10° T in some subjects.\nResults: By plotting linear regression relationship between cone density (per mm\n2\n)\nand axial length (mm) for each retinal location, we found a decrease in cone density\nwith an increase in axial length at nearly all retinal locations as shown by the slope\n(m) of the fit. This trend was strongest at the most peripheral locations, with 24.5°\nS being the most robust (m = -0.0023) followed by 25° N (m = -0.0020) and finally\n25° T (m = -0.0019). This trend was observed at a 4x slower rate at 13° T, (m = -0.0005),\nand at a 100x slower rate at the fovea (m = -0.000002). At 13° N, cone density increased\nslightly with increasing axial elongation by a very shallow margin (m = +0.0004),\nwhich may have been caused by an artifact from decreased image quality in this region\ndue to significantly thicker overlying retinal nerve fiber layer.\nConclusion: In our subjects, we found that cone density is most tightly correlated with changing\naxial length rather than refractive error. Initial analysis indicates that there was\na greater reduction of cone density at the 25° mid-peripheral locations in response\nto increased axial length, suggesting that the tractional forces are greatest in this\nregion rather than at the fovea or parafovea during the process of axial elongation\nof the globe.","title":"iIn vivo Cione Photoreceptor Imaging in Adolescents as a Measure of Retinal Stretch  During Refractive Error Development","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180074\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Elaine Wells-Gray, Nathan Doble, Stacey Choi\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Ohio State College of Optometry, Ohio State College of Optometry, Ohio State College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, cases of narrow or closed angles in patients with\nglaucoma have not been specifically studied in these settings. Such patients often\nrequire timely triage and care. Thus the purpose of this study was to examine techniques\nthat may be utilized towards developing a telemedicine approach for this subset of\nglaucoma.\nMethods: The de-identified goniophotographs (G4 flanged goniolens) and anterior segment optical\ncoherence tomography (AS-OCT; Cirrus HD-OCT wide angle-to-angle scan) results were\nextract from 48 eyes of 24 patients referred to Centre for Eye Health for narrow angle\nassessment. These patients were clinically examined by a single expert optometrist\nand reviewed by a consultant ophthalmologist, both with extensive experience in glaucoma\ncare. There were two phases to this experiment. In Phase 1, the superior and inferior\nquadrant goniophotographs were extracted and evaluated by two masked, expert optometrists\n(graders), who graded the structures seen, amount of trabecular pigmentation and iris\ninsertion. In Phase 2, the two graders assessed nasal and temporal AS-OCT scans and\nrecorded the expected gonioscopically visible angle and iris insertion. All presentations\nwere masked and randomized within graders, and were presented digitally such that\ncontrast, brightness and size could be altered. The grading was then assessed by a\nseparate reader. Concordance with the ground truth (physical gonioscopic assessment)\nwas determined.\nResults: In Phase 1, relative to the ground truth, the accuracy of the angular structures,\ntrabecular pigmentation and iris insertion was 43.8%, 23.1% and 41.9%, respectively\nacross both graders. Of the mismatches, the angular structures were nearly always\njudged to be more anterior than the ground truth (89.1%). Only 4 out of the 50 occludable\nangles (non-pigmented trabecular meshwork or less seen) were judged to be wider than\nthe ground truth. In Phase 2, the gonioscopically visible angle was predicted with\nonly 19.7% accuracy across both graders. The iris insertion was concordant with the\ngonioscopic appearance only 46.3% of the time. The degree to which the angles were\nunder- or overestimated showed poor correlation between the two graders (goniophotos:\nr = 0.52, R\n2\n= 0.27; AS-OCT: r = 0.65, R\n2\n= 0.42).\nConclusion: The overall low accuracy of goniophotography grading and interpolation of the degree\nto which an angle is occludable by AS-OCT are some of the barriers to a telemedicine\nmodel for narrow and closed angle glaucoma patients. Further enhancements to these\ntechniques in combination with professional education and practice are required.","title":"Towards a Telemedicine Model for Narrow and Closed Angle Glaucoma Patients Studies  in Goniophotography and AnteriorSegment Optical Coherence Tomography","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180063\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Henrietta Wang, Vincent Khou, Sieu Khuu, Michael Kalloniatis\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia, Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia, UNSW, Centre for Eye Health and SOVS, UNSW Australia\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

An integrated team-based\napproach involving ophthalmologists, optometrists and orthoptists was taken. The service,\noperating one half day per week at the ACO, was designed to provide patient-centred,\neffective and safe care, while facilitating community-based follow-up when appropriate\nand concurrently improving access to hospital care for higher risk patients. Data\nwere collected on attendance, referrals, waitlists, clinician compliance with American\nAcademy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Patterns and RANZCO guidelines (based\non audit of records), development of optic nerve assessment skills of clinicians (%\ncorrect diagnosis on the validated online \"˜Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy Examination'\nprogram) and costs. Surveys were used to evaluate the patient and clinician experience.\nResults: A total of 1,408 patients from the E&E waitlist met the eligibility criteria, of which\n1,024 were examined in the collaborative clinic over the first 17 months. Approximately\ntwo thirds (65%) either had no glaucoma (9%), or were low risk suspects (45%) or high\nrisk suspects (11%), with the remainder having primary open angle glaucoma (25%),\nanother type of glaucoma (4%), ocular hypertension (1%), or other diagnosis (5%).\nMore than three quarters (76%) were discharged to community-based optometry review,\n17% were re-referred to the E&E or other public hospital, and 7% were discharged to\nprivate ophthalmology. The number of new patients waiting for glaucoma assessment\nat the E&E was reduced by 32%. Compliance with practice guidelines was greater than\n85%. Optic nerve assessment skills improved (mean change 14%; p < 0.05). Of the\n72 patients who responded to the survey, 98% were satisfied with the quality of care\nand 95% preferred to have been seen in the collaborative clinic rather than have remained\non the E&E waitlist.

CareTrack found that 57% of Australians receive appropriate healthcare\n(excludes eyecare). This study aimed to determine the percentage of eyecare encounters\nat which a sample of Australians received appropriate eyecare (i.e. care in line with\nevidence-based or consensus-based guidelines).\nMethods: A random sample of 1200 clinical records (for 2013-2014) were retrospectively reviewed\nto measure compliance with 94 clinical indicators for preventative, glaucoma and diabetic\neyecare. Clinical records were sourced from a random stratified sample of 40 optometry\npractices within four Australian states, chosen to be representative of the adult\nAustralian population. Clinical indicators were extracted from national and international\nevidence-based clinical practice guidelines using the Delphi method and involving\n11 experts. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of encounters at which\nthe sample received appropriate eyecare. Factors influencing variations in eyecare\nsuch as patient and practice characteristics were also assessed.\nResults: Of the 297 optometry practices invited, 76 replied, 37 consented, 36 proved eligible\nand 32 were included in the sample. To date, 630 records have been reviewed from 21\noptometry practices (15 from major cities, 3 from inner and outer regional Australia\neach). Australians aged 56.7 ± 16.2 years old in this sample received appropriate\ncare at 70% (95% CI, 68% to 71%) of eyecare encounters.

Common barriers to child eye exams\nnoted at Unite For Sight (UFS) outreach programs include lack of child complaints,\nuninformed mothers (e.g., instruction, communication) and time conflicts with parents'\nwork and child school. In this analysis we compare among mothers, with and without\na personal history of eye exams, the differences in reporting their child having 1)\nan eye exam; and 2) an eye problem (or not) to determine significant barriers to child\nvision care.\nMethods: Mothers of children ?15 years at UFS outreach sites across Ghana were surveyed. Data\nfrom this convenience sample was assessed to explore differences, among mothers with\nor without a personal history of eye exam, in a child 1) getting an eye exam; and,\n2) having an eye problem. The Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables\nand logistic regression to assess the crude association between history of maternal\neye exam and 1) child receipt of eye exam; and, 2) child having an eye problem. Eye\nproblem was self-reported by mothers based on medical history or personal assessment.\nResults: There was strong correlation between a child eye exam and mother-reported child eye\nproblems, regardless of mothers' personal history of eye exam (w/=0.54, w/o =0.70).\nEye exam: Among 74 mothers who reported no history of personal eye exams, 28(37.8%)\nreported at least one child with eye exam, while in the 186 mothers with a personal\nhistory of eye exam, 69 (37%) reported at least one child with an eye exam.

Each OD4 performed 3 sequential GAT readings on each eye. Prior\nto each GAT reading, an investigator set the instrument drum to a random position\nbetween 10 and 40 mmHg (determined by lottery) and placed a mask over the drum. After\neach reading the investigator recorded the measurement and set the drum to a new random\nposition. The OD4 was blinded to both the initial drum position and his readings.\nResults: 29 OD4s performed GAT on 11 patients over a 6 month period. 20 pairs of measurements\nwere performed on right eyes (OD) and 19 on left eyes (OS), yielding a total of 234\nreadings available for analysis. Mean (SD) IOP readings for right eyes were 20.53\n(4.42) mmHg, 20.50 (5.09) mmHg; and 19.00 (4.27) mmHg for the first, second and third\nsequential readings, respectively, and 21.79 (7.90) mmHg, 19.82 (5.89) mmHg, and 20.79\n(7.92) mmHg for the first, second and third sequential readings performed on left\neyes, reaspectively. Repeated measures 2-factor ANOVA revealed no significant difference\n(p >0.05) amongst the 3 sequential IOP readings nor between right/left eyes. Repeatability\nmeasures for right and left eyes were similar. Values for all eyes combined are reported\nhere. Within subject standard deviation of GAT readings was 3.96 mmHg, and the coefficient\nof variation was 19.5%. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC\n2,1\n),\nusing a 2-way mixed effects model for absolute agreement of single measures, was 0.57\n(95% CI: 0.45-0.68), and varied widely between patients (range: -1.00 - 0.91). Mean\nbias between paired OD4s was not significantly different from 0 (p = 0.08). Because\nPearson's correlation coefficient (r) for the difference between paired OD4s and mean\nIOP was high (r = 0.45), the data were log transformed to calculate limits of agreement\n(FIGURE). ICC\n2,1\nfor the 117 paired GAT readings was 0.53 (0.38 - 0.65).\nThe standard error of measurement was 4.12 mmHg, and the minimum detectable change\nwas 11.43 mmHg.\nConclusion: GAT performed by OD4s on glaucoma patients is moderately repeatable. Our findings\nsuggest that readings performed by OD4s are much more reliable in some patients than\nothers, and are less reliable at higher IOP levels. We suggest that an experienced\nclinician confirm high GAT readings and those performed on difficult patients.","title":"Repeatability of Goldmann Tonometry Performed by Optometry Interns on Glaucoma Patients","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180067\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carolyn Majcher, William Sponsel, Susan Johnson, Denisse Lopez\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of the Incarnate Word, University of the Incarnate Word, University of the Incarnate Word, University of the Incarnate Word\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Post-lens\ntear dynamics was measured using Out-in method, which required 5µl of 2% FITC-Dextran\ninstilled on the bulbar conjunctiva during lens wear. The time taken to observe the\nfirst sign of fluorescence in the post-lens tear reservoir was recorded with a stop\nwatch. Out-in measurements were collected at 20 minutes and 5 hours after lens insertion\nfor Groups #1 and #2, respectively. Questionnaires were distributed to each subject\nat each visit to rate comfort and fogginess while wearing scleral lenses. Additionally,\ntear dynamics under the lens was observed in Group#1 with the fluorogram using a modified\nslit lamp technique (Tan et al., 2018) to monitor fluoresecence intensity in the post-lens\ntear film and with high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (ENVISU\n2300; Bioptigen Inc.) to measure the post-len tear thickness(PoLTT) over 5 hours of\nlens wear.\nResults: 66.7% and and 63.3% of the subjects in Groups #1 and #2, respectively, achieved Out-in\nTimes less than 5 minutes. Excluding out-in time observations equal and exceeding\n5 minutes, thinner PoLTT had shorter Out-in Times at 20 minutes post-lens insertion(p=0.045),\nbut PoLTT was not associated with Out-in Times at 5 hours post-lens insertion. No\nrelationship was found between Out-in Times and subjective ratings for comfort and\nfogginess in both groups. Using qualitative analysis on 60 series of data for 20 eyes\nin Group#1 (Mean±SD: 2.06±2.0 years) to compare the changes in both fluoresecence\nintensity and PoLTT with respect to lens-wearing time, 60.0% indicated tear dynamics\nunder scleral lenses was due to both tear mixing and lens settling, 13.3% was mostly\ndue to tear mixing while 26.7% was mostly due to lens settling.\nConclusion: Tear flow into the post-lens tear reservoir under a scleral lens on subjects with\nhealthy cornea was observed at 20 minutes and 5 hours after lens insertion. After\n5 hours of lens wear, roughly one third of the subjects had no tear flow into the\npost-lens reservioir as the observed decline in post-lens tear fluorescence was mainly\ndue to lens settling.","title":"Tear Dynamics Under Scleral Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180058\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Clinical Research Center, University of California Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Bo Tan, Young Hyun Kim, Yixiu Zhou, Meng Lin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Clinical Research Center, University of California Berkeley, Clinical Research Center, University of California Berkeley, Clinical Research Center, University of California Berkeley, Clinical Research Center, University of California Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

NF may be the preferred method for tear film analysis for scleral lens\nresearch, by maximizing sample tear volume in keratoconic subjects and reducing sample\nprotein component dilution.","title":"Comparison of Two Tear Collection Methods for IL8 Analysis in Keratoconic Scleral  Lens Wearers","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180059\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry and Vision Science\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Paul Murphy, Luigina Sorbara\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry and Vision Science, School of Optometry and Vision Science\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

The fluid layer under the lens provides\nconstant lubrication to the cornea and the smooth optical surface of the lens helps\nto improve vision in those with distorted corneas. However, in order for a scleral\nlens to provide these benefits, sterile saline must be used to fill the lens chamber.\nMultidose\npreservative-free, pH-balanced, sterile saline buffered with boric acid and sodium\nborate (PuriLens Plus, The Lifestyle Co, Freehold, NJ) is commonly used off-label\nto fill scleral lenses prior to application on the eye. While the label indicates\nthat a bottle should be thrown out after 15 days, it is unclear if the saline may\nbe contaminated with the use of scleral lenses during this length of time. As the\nfluid resides over the ocular surface for the duration of lens wear, contaminated\nsolution may increase the risk for infectious complications.\nThe purpose\nof our study is to evaluate the bacteriostatic effect of this sterile buffered saline\nafter being inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nMethods: Two lots of Purilens solution were seeded with S. aureus (ATCC BAA-976)\nor P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) at a final concentration of 5 x 10\n5\ncolony forming units (CFU)/mL. Sterile 0.45% saline similarly seeded with P. aeruginosa\nand uninoculated Purilens solution served as controls. All solutions were kept\nat 20-25°C. Organism counts were performed at baseline (day 0) and on days 1, 2, 7,\n14, 21, and 28 by plating 3 different dilutions of each solution to sheep blood agar\nplates, incubating the plates at 35°C in ambient air for 24-96 hours, and daily counting\nof colonies.\nResults: For both Purilens lots, S. aureus steeply declined in CFU/mL between days 0\nand 14. For P. aeruginosa, counts for lot 1 progressively declined until there\nwas no growth from days 7 to 21, but returned on day 28 to within 1-log of day 0 counts.\nIn contrast, lot 2 P. aeruginosa counts declined on day 1 and stayed within\n1-log of day 0 counts through day 28. Organism counts of P. aeruginosa inoculated\nto 0.45% saline took until day 14 to decline by 1-log and returned to original counts\non day 28.\nConclusion: The bacteriostatic effect of multidose preservative-free, buffered saline such as\nPurilens solution had minor but noticeable differences between lots for P. aeruginosa,\nwhile the solution was bacteriostatic for S. aureus for at least 28 days. Additional\norganism strains and lots of solutions should be tested to rigorously examine the\nability of these buffered solutions to withstand microorganism contamination that\nmay occur during the course of daily use by patients.","title":"Bacteriostatic Effect of Multidose PreservativeFree Buffered Saline Used in Scleral  Lens Wear","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180060\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        USC Roski Eye Institute\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Rosemary She, Seungheon Lee\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        USC, USC\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Respondents were provided access to a website or paper survey to participate.\nThe survey included a new question on testing visual acuity (VA) submitted by the\nNational Center for Children's Vision and Eye Health to describe access to VA testing.\nThis presentation will review responses to the new question as to whether a child\nhad VA testing and the location of the testing. The analysis looks at factors that\nwould direct the Center to improve interventions promoting vision health, development,\nand learning readiness.\nMethods: NSCH is administered by the US Census Bureau for the HHS, HRSA, & MCHB to U.S. families\nfocusing on children from birth-17 years of age. The 2016 data, released in September\n2017, was analyzed with SPSS V21.0. The analysis will reflect the subjects that responded\noverall as well as those that report VA testing. Data will look at associations with\nage, SES, and child health status. \"Don't know\" and missing responses were denoted\nas \"missing.\" The NSCH is publicly available data and Institutional Review Board approval\nwas not required for this study.\nResults: 50,212 valid surveys representing all states and DC were included. One child per household\nwas chosen at random for the questions (51.2% male, mean age 9.4 yrs±5.27). 36,272\n(69.6%) respondents stated VA was tested in the past 2 years (population estimate\nof 50,798,467). VA was tested in each age group as: birth through 5 yrs-38.9%, 6 through\n11 yrs-85.2%, and 12 through 17 yrs-83.2%. Of those who stated VA was tested, 70.2%\nindicated that they had insurance. Response of testing was higher with higher income\n(<200% FPL - 67%, >399% - 72.5%) and for children with special health care needs\n(82%) as compared to children without special health care needs (66.6%). Of those\nwho stated VA was tested and the child had seen an eye doctor-59.1%, an MD-39.6%,\nat clinic-3.3%, at school-23.1%. The likelihood of seeing an eye doctor increased\nwith age (0-5yrs-32.5%, 6-11yrs-53.1%, 12-17yrs-72.9%).

For each surveillance mechanism, the prevalence\nrates of VI in the 50 states was correlated between 2015 and 2016. For each of the\ntwo years, the VI prevalence rates between the ACS and BRFSS in the 50 states were\ncompared using a paired t-test. Regression analysis was used to assess the correlation\nof VI estimates between the ACS and BRFSS. To assess the magnitude of any differences\nbetween the ACS and BRFSS, the ratio of the VI prevalence rates between the two were\ncalculated for each state for each of the two years.\nResults: There was considerable geographic variability in the prevalence of VI in both the\nACS and BRFSS. In 2015, the estimated prevalence of vision impairment ranged from\n1.9% (North Dakota) to 8.6% (Mississippi) in the BRFSS and 1.5% (Minnesota) to 3.9%\n(West Virginia) in the ACS. In 2016, the estimated prevalence of vision impairment\nranged from 2.5% (North Dakota) to 8.5% (West Virginia) in the BRFSS and 1.6% (Minnesota)\nto 4.1% (West Virginia) in the ACS. Within each surveillance mechanism, the VI prevalence\nwas highly correlated between 2015 and 2016 (R\n2\n=0.935 and R\n2\n=0.871\nfor the ACS and BRFSS, respectively).

About 4% to 8% of the general population, as well as almost\nhalf of the patients with post-concussive syndrome, have symptomatic CI, which negatively\nimpacts their quality of life. Office-based vision therapy has been reported to successfully\nremediate these symptoms one-year post-treatment. Randomized clinical trials report\nthat office-based vergence and accommodative therapy is 73% effective in remediating\nvision symptoms in neurologically normal patients, while home-based therapy is not\nsubstantially better than sham therapy, perhaps due to poor compliance. Hence, innovative\nand more engaging techniques are needed to design a home-based solution that is as\neffective as office-based vision therapy.\nMethods: Nine symptomatic CI patients (22.6 + 4.7 years, 5M) participated in 12 one-hour virtual\nreality vision therapy sessions and were re-examined post-therapy by a masked examiner.\nOutcome measures included near point of convergence (NPC), positive fusional vergence\n(PFV), and the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS). Vision therapy was\nperformed in an office setting using a proprietary therapy software: Virtual Eye Rotation\nVision Exercises (VERVE). VERVE uses commercially available hardware (a gaming laptop\nand a virtual reality head-mounted display) integrated with eye tracking and custom\nvirtual reality video game software. VERVE changes the angular convergence and sustained\nconvergence demands using custom programmable scripts which increase in difficulty\nas the sessions progress.\nResults: Statistically significant improvements using paired t-tests were observed for NPC\n(before = 10.4 + 3.1 cm; after = 5.3 + 2.2 cm; p=0.005), PFV (before = 14.7\n+ 3.2 Î”; after = 25.1 + 11.4 Î”; p=0.03), and CISS (before = 35.6 + 6; after\n= 19.9 + 6; p=0.001). All subjects were less symptomatic after participating\nin VERVE, and the mean CISS score dropped below 21 which is considered the cutoff\nfor symptomatic young adult CI patients.\nConclusion: These pilot data suggest that VERVE vision therapy software shows promise as a treatment\nmethod to decrease symptoms and improve NPC and PFV in young adults with symptomatic\nCI. A large scale study with a sham group is needed that includes both adults and\nchildren to determine whether the use of a specific video game, VERVE, will improve\ncompliance when used as a home-based treatment option.

Our experiments\nwere aimed at exploring whether playing video games in a virtual 3-dimensional (3D)\nenvironment modifies depth perception.\nMethods: Altogether, 24 healthy young adults with no previous video game experience were recruited\nin two groups. In the treatment group (3DVG, n=12), participants were required to\nplay stereoscopic 3D video games for a total of 40 hours, 2 hours per session, over\n4-5 weeks. First-person shooter action video games were used. In the control group\n(2DVG, n=12), participants played the same video games but in 2D mode for the same\ntime course. Stereoacuity was measured using random dot stereograms before and after\nthe video game intervention. Each random-dot stimulus consisted of a 1-degree central\nsquare of random dots embedded in a 3.3-degree square of random dots. A custom-built\n4-mirror haploscope was used to present a half monitor screen to each eye (i.e. the\nleft square to the left eye and the right square to the right eye). Sub-pixel horizontal\nbinocular disparities were introduced by shifting the phases of Fourier components\nin the two central squares (opposite signs) in an orientation and spatial frequency\ndependent manner. A method of constant stimuli was used to measure stereoacuity. The\nvisual task was to determine the stereoscopic depth of the central square (in front\nor behind) relative to the outer reference square. No feedback was provided for each\nresponse. Stereoacuity was defined as the disparity at the 84% correct response rates\nobtained by fitting a Probit function.\nResults: After playing 3D video games, we observed a remarkable 33.5% improvement in mean stereoacuity.\nThere was a statistically significant difference in stereoacuity before and after\nthe video game intervention in the 3DVG treatment group (mean difference=11.16 arcsec;\npaired t=3.63, p=0.004), but not in the 2DVG control group (mean difference=-0.08\narcsec; paired t=0.10, p=0.92).\nConclusion: Here we show that playing stereoscopic 3D video games for a short period of time can\nimprove depth perception. Notably, our most recent experiments (Li et al 2018) have\nshown that these types of 3D video games might have a special benefit for triggering\nthe plasticity of stereo vision in patients with amblyopia.","title":"Stereoscopic 3D Video Games Boost Depth Perception","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180053\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry, University of California- Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Betty Li, Kenneth Tran, John Bui, Bethany Li, Saumil Patel, Susana Chung, Dennis Levi, Roger Li\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry, University of California- Berkeley, School of Optometry, University of California- Berkeley, School of Optometry, University of California- Berkeley, School of Optometry, University of California- Berkeley, Baylor College of Medicine, School of Optometry, University of California- Berkeley, School of Optometry, University of California- Berkeley, School of Optometry, University of California- Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hemisfair Ballroom C3\n                    \n            |#|"}

They had no positive family background for\nglaucoma. Subjects were 16 female and 5 males, aged 24.7 + 4.1 years old. Participants\n(5) wearing SiHy lenses were asked to stop lens wear 72 hours before the measurements.\nBaseline IOP was taken with Goldman tonometry as a reference to establish diurnal\nvariation pattern (IOPg). The following day, transpalpebral IOP (IOPt) was taken with\nDiaton tonometer (DT) before and after 5h00 of SL wear. All measurements were taken\nbetween 8h00 and 13h00. One eye was randomly selected to be fitted with a 15.8 diameter\nSL (L1), and the fellow eye was fitted with an 18 mm SL (L2) of the same design, thickness\nand material. (MSD, Blanchard Labs, Boston XO). Anterior segment tomography (central\nback and front corneal curvatures, anterior chamber volume and depth, irido-corneal\nangle) was taken pre and immediately after lens removal.\nResults: Baseline IOPg (15.2 + 3. 1 mm HG) did not reveal any significant diurnal within\nsubject variations. (t(15) = 0.161; p= 0.874; 95%CI [-0.571, 0.666]). For the eye\nfitted with L1 initial IOP was 10.1 + 1.9 mm HG, rising to 14.4 + 4.8 mm HG 4.5 +\n0.3 hours later. For L2 initial IOP was 9.24 + 2.2 mm HG similarly rising to 14.4\n+ 4.8mm Hg 4.5 + 0.3 hrs later. There is a statistically significant difference based\non time (F=0.694; p=0.000) (t(15) = -4.714; p= 0.000 95%CI [-6.372, -3.056]) but not\nbetween lenses (F=0.694; p=0.415) (t(15) = 0.429; p= 0.450; 95%CI [-0.644, 1.502]).\nAs expected, there is a high variability among subjects (F=339.7; p=0.000). Anterior\nsegment parameters did not vary except for the anterior chamber volume which was found\nto be reduced with both lenses (L1: -1,53 + 7.61 mm3; L2: -3.47 + 6.4 mm3). Within\nsubjects overall difference (F=4.805; p=0.035) was found statistically significant,\nfor both lenses.\nConclusion: The results of this study suggest that scleral lenses can be associated with increased\nocular pressure up to 5 mm Hg, after 4 hours of wear. Scleral lens diameter does not\ninfluence this outcome. Practitioners should be warned to take precautions when using\nthis correction modality on populations at risk for glaucoma.","title":"IntraOcular Pressure Variation Following the Wear of Scleral Lenses of Different  Diameters","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180054\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Montreal School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Claude Giasson, Dan Samaha\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Montreal School of Optometry, University of Montreal School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, these individuals function binocularly with conditions that\npresent with significant asymmetry in the two eyes. This analysis starts unaided and\nevaluates optical and visual bilateral asymmetry of individuals with ectasia (as monocular\nperformance improved) across (1) the subject's habitual correction, (2) best conventional\nscleral lenses (BCSL), (3) individualized WGSL.\nMethods: Individualized WGSL (customized through the 5\nth\nradial order) and BCSL\n(18 spherical, 2 sphero-cylindrical) were fit to 20 eyes (8 mild, 11 moderate, 1 severe)\nof 10 subjects (9 keratoconus, 1 pellucid marginal degeneration) and worn for 8 weeks\neach in a randomized cross-over study. Wavefront error (WFE) (mean of 3 measures),\nletter contrast sensitivity (CS) (mean of 3 measures per spatial frequency (SF): 4,\n8, 16 cpd), and high contrast visual acuity (VA) (mean of 3 logMAR charts) were recorded\nmonocularly with each correction. The visual image quality metric logVSX was calculated\nfrom the WFE. The magnitude of difference (Î”) between the two eyes of each individual\nwas calculated for each outcome with each correction.\nResults: All subjects showed significant bilateral asymmetry in unaided aberration structures\nthat, unlike normal eyes, were not correlated (neither directly nor mirror-symmetrically).\nAs\nmonocular performance was refined and improved across corrections there was substantial\nvariation in bilateral asymmetry. As a result, mean changes in bilateral asymmetry\nwere not statistically significant, however from the perspective of each individual,\nmany were clinically meaningful:\nBilateral difference in mean HORMS decreased\n56% from unaided (Î” 0.986 um) to habitual (Î” 0.438 um), 51% from habitual to BCSL\n(Î” 0.216 um), and 65% from BCSL to WGSL (Î” 0.076 um).

Statistical analysis was done through the utilization of Chi-square analysis,\ndescriptive statistics, and logistic regression.\nResults: The survey was initiated by 317 individuals (4.4%). The behavior of rinsing gas permeable\n(GP) contact lenses with tap water was reported by 60.5% of the sample, yet 33.6%\nof the participants reported rinsing GPs with water in front of patients.

The soughing of corneal epithelial\ncells is a possible source of the particulate that collects under a scleral lens causing\nfogging. Utilizing a solution under the lens that more closely mimics the pH and essential\nion composition of the tears may help to minimize corneal cell sloughing than current\nsaline formulations that are commonly used.\nMethods: Scleral lens wearers who experience fogging were recruited to participate in a three\nvisit study.

Intraocular pressure\n(IOP) and CSFP are the driving components of translaminar pressure difference (TLPD),\nwhich directly effects the optic nerve head and contained lamina cribrosa. The lack\nof continuous and accurate CSFP measurement has impeded research into the role of\nTLPD in glaucoma.\nMethods: We have developed an implantable pressure telemetry system based on a small piezoelectric\nsensor with low drift. Unilateral IOP is measured from the anterior chamber, intracranial\npressure (ICP, a surrogate measure of CSFP) is measured from the brain parenchyma,\nand arterial blood pressure (BP) is measured from the femoral artery. For these studies,\nwe measured physiologic pressures in three awake and behaving nonhuman primates (NHPs)\nover twenty or more consecutive days at 200Hz for 15 seconds every 2-1/2 minutes,\n24 hours per day.\nResults: Data were collected in three male rhesus macaques (Figure 1) over twenty or more consecutive\ndays, and TLPD was quantified in real time as IOP-ICP. Hourly means of IOP, ICP, and\nTLPD were plotted (Figure 1). Results show that mean ICP is higher during sleep in\nNHPs (Figure 1), resulting in lower nocturnal TLPD in two of the three NHPs. ICP displays\na nycthemeral rhythm in spite of the fact that NHPs sleep sitting up with the neck\nflexed, but the pattern is animal specific. While the NHP is asleep and the neck flexed,\nICP is significantly higher (p-value < 0.001) than when the NHP is awake\nand active with the head upright. IOP showed nocturnal elevation in two of three animals\ndespite NHPs sleeping upright.\nConclusion: TLPD variability, coupled with telemetry, should allow us to test the hypotheses that\nIOP, ICP, and/or TLPD fluctuations contribute independently to glaucoma onset and/or\nprogression.","title":"Intraocular Pressure and Intracranial Pressure Measurement with Continuous Wireless  Telemetry to Quantify Translaminar Pressure Difference in Nonhuman Primates","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180048\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Brian Samuels, James Johnston, J.

Remarkably, although vision-related quality of\nlife (VR-QOL) has been shown to correlate with glaucoma severity, VR-QOL has not,\nto our knowledge, been used to develop a staging system. This study was therefore\ndesigned to explore the viability of creating a glaucoma staging system using VR-QOL\nscores.\nMethods: All subjects were participating in a longitudinal glaucoma research study at the Albuquerque\nVA Medical Center. Inclusion required a diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma,\ndefined by glaucomatous optic neuropathy with corresponding repeatable visual field\n(VF) loss in at least one eye. Subjects were excluded if visually significant cataract,\nmaculopathy or other causes of VF loss were present. Measurement of VR-QOL was accomplished\nthrough clinician-led administration of the NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire, and all subjects\ncompleted 24-2 and 10-2 VF testing within 6 months of completing the questionnaire.\nComprehensive Hodapp-Parish-Anderson (HPA) criteria were used for initial staging\nof each eye's 24-2 VF loss (score 0=no loss, 1=mild loss, 2=moderate loss, 3=advanced\nloss). Subject-based VF loss scores were then created by adding together each eye's\nHPA stage (range 1-6). Lower (score 1,2), intermediate (score 3,4), and higher (score\n5,6) scores were subsequently consolidated as this grouping provided the best subject-based\ndelineation of VF loss severity based on VR-QOL score. Finally, we compared VF summary\nmetrics (mean deviation and pattern standard deviation for 24-2 and 10-2, and visual\nfield index [VFI] for 24-2) across the three VR-QOL based stages to investigate the\nutility of these variables for distinguishing between stages.\nResults: We analyzed 206 eyes of 103 subjects: 57 (28%), 49 (24%), 38 (18%), and 62 (30%) eyes\nhad no, mild, moderate, or severe VF loss respectively. Using VR-QOL based staging,\n42, 37, and 23 subjects were classified as mild, moderate, or advanced disease with\nmedian (interquartile range) VR-QOL scores measuring 92.6 (87.7, 95.4), 87.5 (78.7,\n95.3), and 81.0 (72.9, 87.2) respectively. When visual field summary metrics from\n24-2 and 10-2 VF testing were compared by VR-QOL stage, the 24-2 VFI value (average\nfor both eyes) was the only parameter that was significantly different between each\nstage while simultaneously showing no overlap of interquartile ranges between stages.\nSpecifically, lower, intermediate, and higher VR-QOL scores were associated with these\nrespective mean VFIs: < 85%, 85-94%, and >94%.\nConclusion: Bilateral 24-2 VFI (average value between eyes) corresponds well with stage of glaucomatous\ndisease as defined by NEI-VFQ cumulative score. These results suggest that mean VFI\nscore may have value as an effective and efficient surrogate for estimating patient-specific\nVR-QOL.","title":"Employing VisionRelated Quality of Life Scores to Stage Glaucomatous Visual Field  Loss","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180049\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Michael Sullivan-Mee, Denise Pensyl, Suchitra Katiyar\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hemisfair Ballroom C2\n                    \n            |#|"}

IOP is mainly regulated\nby outflow of aqueous humor through the iridocorneal angle; particulary through the\ntrabecular meshwork (TM). Current in vivo visualization of these structures has poor\nresolution. We altered an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) for\ncellular level in vivo imaging of the iridocorneal angle and performed a preliminary\nstudy of the in vivo anatomy in healthy controls and subjects with pigmentary dispersion\nsyndrome (PDS).\nMethods: A customized gonioscopy lens and holder was added to the Indiana University AOSLO\nenabling adaptive optics gonioscopy (AOG). The right eye of 7 control subjects (ages\n29 to 67) and 2 subjects with pigmentary dispersion syndrome (ages 26 and 31) were\nenrolled. Topical anesthesia was applied and subjects were advanced into the AOG system\nusing a motorized positioner under video monitoring. Video sequences were gathered\nof the inferior iridocorneal angle at 30 Hz. The images were processed in Matlab and\nTM cell size, trabecular beams and pores were measured in Adobe Photoshop CC.\nResults: The iridocorneal angle was imaged in all subjects, with visualization of the corneal\ncollagen bundles, corneal-scleral meshwork (CS), uveal meshwork (UM), and iris. Size\nof the UM beams and pores varied for both control and PDS subjects ranging from 15.2-44.7\nÎ¼m (average 25.5 Î¼m) and 21.2-37 Î¼m (average 29.7 Î¼m). The UM pore size for controls\naveraged 42.6 Î¼m and 58.4 Î¼m for subjects with PDS. The CS pore size for controls\nranged from 7.7-12.1 Î¼m, wheras the CS pore size in subjects with PDS were too small\nto measure. Presumed engorged TM endothelial cells were visible in both PDS subjects.\nThe TM cells for controls ranged from 5.9-7.7 Î¼m (average 21 Î¼m) and from 6-13.8 Î¼m\nfor subjects with PDS. Figure 1 compares the TM of a control subject to a subject\nwith PDS. Blue arrows indicate UM overlying deeper CS meshwork (red arrow) which run\nparallel to the limbus. The left panel is the TM of a subject with PDS. Note the enlarged,\nhighly reflective cells. The UM is slightly out of focus as the densely packed CS\nbeams are visible (red arrow). Scale bars = 50 µm.\nConclusion: Preliminary studies support the ability of AOG to image details of the TM at high\nresolution. Control subjects and those with PDS have similar UM beam size, while subjects\nwith PDS have a larger range in cell size and smaller (immeasurable) CS pore size.\nThe endothelial cells and CS beams appeared engorged in PDS suggesting that the cells\nare actively phagocytosing pigment granules. This technology could provide further\ninsight into inter-subject variability of the TM as well as response to pharmacological\nand surgical alterations to aqueous outflow in people with glaucoma.","title":"In Vivo Adaptive Optics Gonioscopy of the Human Trabecular Meshwork in Controls and  Subjects with Pigmentary Dispersion Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180050\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Thomas Gast, Kaitlyn Sapoznik, Stephen Burns\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University, School of Optometry, Indiana University, School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hemisfair Ballroom C2\n                    \n            |#|"}

Patients may have elevated intra-ocular\npressure alone, or they may have glaucomatous optic neuropathy, visual field defects,\nor both. Different tests may be best suited to monitor these different patients. We\ninvestigated the ability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and static automated\nperimetry (SAP) to detect glaucoma progression in eyes with different baseline classification\nor diagnosis.\nMethods: We included 56 eyes with ocular hypertension, 63 eyes with visual field loss only,\n85 eyes with glaucomatous optic neuropathy only and 133 eyes with both optic disc\nand visual field defects (which we labeled as definite glaucoma) selected from the\nDiagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study or the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation\nStudy. Each eye had 9 visits with retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) from\nSpectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering GmBH, Heidelberg, Germany) and mean sensitivity\n(MS) from the 24-2 SITA standard SAP test (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). Tests\nfor each visit were taken within a one-month period, and visits were separated by\n3 to 36 months. We averaged pointwise sensitivities in linear units to obtain MS and\nexpressed both RNFLT and MS as percent of mean normal. For each eye, we fitted linear\nregression separately to RNFLT and MS data for series of 7, 8 and 9 visits. With specificity\nfixed at 95%, eyes with significant worsening on RNFLT or MS were flagged as progressing.\nPositive rate, the percentage of eyes flagged as progressing, was computed for RNFLT\nand MS. The McNemar's test was used to determine whether the positive rates for RNFLT\nwere significantly different from those obtained for MS in each of the four baseline\nclassifications of eyes.\nResults: Figure 1 shows the positive rates and 95% confidence intervals for RNFLT and MS for\nthe four baseline classifications. For visits 7 to 9, the positive rates for RNFLT\nwere greater than for MS by a factor of 2.7 to 8.0 (ocular hypertension), 2.2 to 3.6\n(visual field loss only), 1.8 to 4.2 (glaucomatous optic neuropathy only) and 1.6\nto 1.9 (definite glaucoma). RNFLT had significantly greater positive rates than MS\nfor all comparisons (all p < 0.02), except at visits 7 and 8 (both p = 0.52) for\nthe eyes with visual field loss only. After applying Bonferroni corrections (significance\nset at 0.0125), the positive rates for RNFLT and MS were also not significantly different\nat visit 9 for those with definite glaucoma (p = 0.014).\nConclusion: Overall, RNFLT was more likely to identify progression than MS in each of the baseline\nclassifications of eyes. Our results suggest that RNFLT should be assessed in all\npatients, regardless of their initial diagnosis.","title":"The Impact of the Baseline Classification of Eyes on the Ability of Structural and  Functional Tests to Identify Glaucoma Progression","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180038\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        IvÃ¡n MarÃ­n-Franch, Lyne Racette\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

For this investigation, subjects were diagnosed\neither primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or glaucoma suspect (GS). POAG subjects\nhad glaucomatous optic neuropathy with repeatable VF loss while GS subjects had ocular\nhypertension and/or optic nerve appearance that was suspicious for glaucoma but no\nrepeatable VF loss. Subjects with significant cataract, macular pathology or non-glaucomatous\nVF loss were excluded. Presence of 10-2 VF loss was defined by repeatable defect clusters\non the pattern deviation plot that obeyed the horizontal midline. Location of 10-2\nVF loss (none, superior, inferior, both) was recorded for all eyes. The NEI-VFQ-25\nvision-related quality of life (VR-QOL) questionnaire, consisting of 25 questions\nthat probe various aspects of everyday visual function, was administered to each subject\nwithin 6 months of 10-2 VF testing. Cumulative and subscale scores were recorded for\nanalysis.\nResults: Mean age in this study's 171 subjects (103 POAG, 68 GS) was 71.8 (SD 8.0) years, and\nVR-QOL was significantly higher in the GS vs. POAG group (p=0.03).

When comparing subjects with superior\nonly vs. inferior only 10-2 VF loss, VR-QOL scores were not significantly different\nexcept for the dependency subscale in which subjects with inferior 10-2 VF loss had\na lower score (p=0.03).

Notably, the lowest VR-QOL scores in this study were found in the subgroup\nwith binocular 10-2 VF loss when at least one eye had defects in both hemifields.\nConclusion: Monocular 10-2 VF loss, regardless of whether it is located superiorly, inferiorly,\nor both, did not significantly impact VR-QOL scores in this study. Conversely, VR-QOL\nscores were significantly reduced when subjects had binocular 10-2 VF loss, particularly\nwhen at least one of the eyes had both superior and inferior defects. These results\nsuggest that aggressive management may be indicated for preventing binocular 10-2\nVF loss in patients demonstrating monocular 10-2 VF loss.","title":"Quality of Life in Glaucoma Impact of 102 Visual Field Loss Location and Laterality","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180039\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Denise Pensyl, Suchitra Katiyar, Nimesh Patel, Michael Sullivan-Mee\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center, Albuquerque VA Medical Center\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

We previously presented a basis for customizing perimetric\nlocations to identify macular damage in patients with glaucoma. We applied customized\nmethods to evaluate perimetric and structural defects at different depths of the retinal\nnerve fiber layer (RNFL) referenced to the inner limiting membrane. The correspondence\nbetween functional and structural defects was present in 9 of 10 patients when we\ndefined a location as having perimetric defect with a value of ˆ’5 dB or lower on the\ntotal deviation (TD) or pattern deviation (PD) maps derived from control data. In\nthis study, we aimed to confirm these results in another 10 patients with glaucoma\nand assess whether the choice made for defining perimetric defect was reasonable.\nMethods: Ten patients with glaucoma were recruited from an ongoing glaucoma study, and their\ndata were compared to our published data from 10 other patients with glaucoma and\n30 age-similar control participants. Patients were selected based on structural macular\ndamage observed on en face images of the RNFL bundles, asymmetry analysis of the ganglion\ncell layer or a circumpapillary RNFL profile consistent with macular damage. En face\nimages of the RNFL were obtained from all participants using Spectralis OCT; an imaging\nprotocol was applied to visualize RNFL bundles across much of the central ±30° of\nthe retina. To measure perimetric sensitivities, we used a customized blob stimulus\n(a Gaussian blob with 0.25°) at the 10-2 grid locations. To assess the effectiveness\nof the choice used in the published study, a perimetric defect was defined as two\nor more adjoining locations below three levels for TD or PD derived from control participants:\nˆ’4 dB, ˆ’5 dB, and ˆ’6 dB. TD was computed as the difference from the mean normal value\nfor each location. PD was calculated based on the seventh highest value of TD for\na participant subtracted from the average of the seventh highest TDs for the controls.\nResults: The ˆ’5 dB criterion identified perimetric defects in 7 of the new 10 patients. These\ndefects corresponded to the pattern of structural loss observed on en face images\nof the RNFL bundles. For the 30 controls, the only criterion that yielded perimetric\ndefects was the ˆ’4 dB criterion for TD, which scored defects in two controls. For\nall 20 patients, the ˆ’4 dB criterion identified defects in 16 using TD and 18 using\nPD, the ˆ’5 dB criterion identified 15 using TD and PD, and the ˆ’6 dB criterion identified\n15 using TD and 12 using PD.\nConclusion: We confirmed in the 10 new patients with glaucoma our original finding that the correspondence\nbetween the functional and structural defects in the macula provides a basis for customizing\nperimetric locations. This finding was robust when we evaluated different definitions\nof abnormality.","title":"Refining a Basis for Customizing Perimetric Locations within the Macula using Custom  Perimetric Stimuli and Montaged Images","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180040\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Qassim University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        William Swanson, Brett King\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

For all tasks, the stimuli consisted of a 3x3 number\nmatrix with a new set of numbers displayed every 10 seconds. In the passive task,\nsubjects were instructed to look at the numbers. In the active task, subjects who\nknew how to add were instructed to add each set of numbers silently in rows then columns.\nChildren who did not know how to add were asked questions about the numbers (i.e.\nWhat numbers are on the top?). Three-way (cognitive effort, stimuli size, age group)\nmixed analyses of variance with post-hoc analyses (Bonferroni) were performed for\neach outcome variable (accommodative response, RMS, and pupil size) to understand\nthe effects of cognitive effort (passive vs active), stimuli size (20/50 vs 20/100),\nand age (children vs adults) on accommodation and pupil size.\nResults: A significant three-way interaction between cognitive effort, size, and age group\nwas not detected for response, RMS, or pupil size (p > 0.05). There was a statistically\nsignificant two-way interaction between cognitive effort and age group for response\n(F=8.86, P=0.005) and RMS (F=8.01, P=0.007). There was a simple main effect of cognitive\neffort on both response (F=11.01, P=0.003) and RMS (F=13.17, P=0.002) in children\nand RMS (F=26.14, P<0.001) in adults.

The adults had significantly\ngreater RMS when passively viewing the stimulus (MD=0.04D, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.05).

In adults, there was no significant difference in response between\npassive and active viewing, however, the response was significantly more stable during\nthe active task but the difference is not likely to be clinically meaningful. Pupils\nwere greatest when actively viewing the stimuli, suggesting that pupil size may be\naffected by increased cognitive effort independent of the accommodative response.\nOur results also suggest that in children, cognitive effort may influence the accommodative\nresponse more than stimulus size during near tasks.","title":"Impact of Cognitive Effort and Stimuli Size on Accommodation and Pupil Size in Children  and Adults","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180041\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Akron Children's Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Molly Curtiss, Alyssa Gehring\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Akron Children's Hospital, Akron Children's Hospital\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

This\nstudy compared refractions determined by optimization of two different metrics at\nboth 4 and 6mm pupil diameters to determine the impact of pupil size on the identification\nof refractions for both adults with and without Down syndrome.\nMethods: Dilated wavefront error (WFE) was obtained from the right eye of 27 adults with DS\nand 24 without. Two separate refractions were determined for each eye for analysis\nconducted at a 4mm versus a 6mm pupil. For each eye, >12,000 sphero-cylindrical\ncombinations of refraction were added to the measured WFE for each pupil size to generate\nresidual WFE and calculate the resultant value for the visual Strehl ratio (VSX) and\nthe pupil fraction (PFST). The single refraction corresponding with the best value\nfor each metric at each pupil size was identified. Refractions were then converted\nto vector notation (M, J\n0\n, J\n45\n) and the differences in each\nvector component calculated between the 4 and 6mm refractions within each metric and\neye. Total dioptric difference between refractions was calculated as the square root\nof the sum of the squares of –³M, –³J\n0\n, –³J\n45\n. Repeated measures\nANOVA was used to test for mean differences across the dioptric differences between\ngroups and across metrics.\nResults: The overall range of refractions was broad for each group with sphere power ranging\nfrom -15.25 to +6.00D for DS eyes (mean: -0.92±5.48D) and from -9.00 to +6.25D for\ncontrols (mean: -1.69±3.08D). Cylinder power was also widely distributed from -0.50\nto -8.50DC for DS eyes (mean: -2.22±1.68DC) and 0 to -4.00DC for controls (mean: -1.05±0.77DC).\nDioptric difference between refractions for 4 and 6mm pupils was significantly greater\nin subjects with DS (0.51D vs 0.19D, p=0.001). Dioptric difference was also greater\nwhen optimizing PFST versus VSX (0.45D vs 0.26D, p=0.04). There was not a significant\ninteraction between group and metric (p=0.47). In tallying the dioptric differences,\n56% of individuals with DS had differences less than 0.50D when optimizing PFST versus\n85% when optimizing VSX. In controls, 92% had differences less than 0.50D for PFST\nversus 100% for VSX.\nConclusion: These data indicate that optimization of PFST to determine objective refraction is\nmore susceptible to differences related to pupil size than VSX. Pupil size will likely\nnot impact refraction determination for typical eyes, but was found to have a greater\ninfluence in DS eyes. Even so, the differences in refraction observed in DS eyes,\nparticularly when utilizing VSX, were still clinically tolerable between pupil sizes,\nreaching a 0.50D or less for the majority of subjects.","title":"Effect of Pupil Size on Determination of Objective Refractions for Adults with and  without Down Syndrome","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180042\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Ayeswarya Ravikumar, Jason Marsack, Julia Benoit\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Three corrections (-6 D, -3 D, and +1 D) of each model\nwere measured. The lenses measured included: two Ultra lens models (B&L), three models\nof the Air Optix Aqua (Alcon), four models of the Biofinity lens (Cooper Vision),\nand three models of the Oasys lens (J&J).\nThe optical profiles obtained from the\nNIMO contained 28 points per mm and were translated to their corresponding wavefronts\nby locally segmenting the pupil. Once the multifocal wavefronts were created, a standard\nFourier procedure was applied to obtain the VSOTF through focus between -1 and 5 D.\nTwo values were obtained to compare the optical properties (between optical infinity\nand a working distance of 20 cm) of the 13 designs: the area under the through focus\nVSOTF (normalized by the area obtained for the monofocal design) and the interval\nof acceptable quality through focus.\nResults: The area under the through focus VSOTF ranges from 0.80 (Oasys L) to 1.42 (Ultra H)\nand the range through focus varies from 0.93 D (Oasys L) to 2.73 D (Ultra H). The\noptical performance of the Oasys M and the Oasys L is comparable to the one produced\nby a monofocal lens. The contact lenses manufactured by B&L, Alcon, and Cooper Vision,\nshift the VSOTF towards more positive values when the myopic correction increases.\nConclusion: A new method to evaluate the optical profiles of multifocal contact lenses has been\npresented. With this method it is possible to observe how designs for old presbyopes\n- Ultra H, AOA H, Oasys H - spread the VSOTF across around 2.5 D through focus. The\npeak performance of these designs, however, is lower than the one obtained for lenses\nthat are used by young presbyopes - Ultra L, AOA M and L, Bio 1.50 and 1.00. Designs\nintended for young presbyopes do not extend the VSOTF more than 2 D but do conserve\na higher peak performance that young presbyopes move through focus by using the partial\naccommodation they still conserve.","title":"Understanding the Optical Properties of Commercial Multifocal Contact Lenses","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180043\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Chicago College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Marcell, Chelsea Des Rosiers, Garrett Pashak, Nicole Purrier\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Midwestern University, Chicago College of Optometry, Midwestern University, Chicago College of Optometry, Midwestern University, Chicago College of Optometry, Midwestern University, Chicago College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

For all pair-wise\ncomparisons of the center-near design, the smaller COZ outperformed the larger COZ.\nNo other significant differences were observed for any condition.\nConclusion: Subjective response ratings were separated by no more than 2 units in all situations.\nSoft multifocal contact lenses with high add power and maximizing the area of plus\nby decreasing (center-distance) or increasing (center-near) center optic zone can\nbe worn without a clinically meaningful decrease in subjective visual performance.","title":"Subjective Performance of Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses of Various Add Powers and  Center Optic Zone Sizes","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180044\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Katherine Bickle, Jeffrey Walline\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The Ohio State University College of Optometry, The Ohio State University College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

The donor cornea was randomly assigned in a masked fashion to the surgeon\nwith PT of 0-7 days (0-7d PT) or 8-14 days (8-14d PT). Clinical examinations were\nperformed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Graft success at 3 years was the primary endpoint.\nIn addition, ECL in 945 eyes of 769 participants with successful DSAEKs at 3 years\nwas determined by a central image analysis reading center from clinical specular or\nconfocal central endothelial images.\nResults: Overall 1251 of 1330 eyes (94.1%) were successful at 3 years. Of 79 graft failures,\n33 (41.8%) and 12 (15.2%) eyes were primary donor failure and early failure, respectively;\n8 (10.1%) were due to graft rejection; 14 (17.7%) were due to endothelial decompensation;\n5 (6.3%) were due to glaucoma or hypotony; 2 (2.5%) were due to infection; 4 (5.1%)\nwere refractive or visual failure; and 1 (1.3%) was due to damage during processing.\nThe 3-year graft success rate was 95.3% (0-7d PT group) and 92.1% (8-14d PT group),\nstatistically not similar (confidence limit of 5.4% exceeding the pre-specified non-inferiority\nlimit of 4%), with more primary donor failures in the 8-14d PT group. Most of the\ndifference of failure rates between the groups occurred in the first postoperative\nmonth, with the probability of failure in the first month being 2.4% in the 0-7d PT\ngroup and 4.9% in the 8-14d PT group, and the conditional probability of 3-year failure\nafter the first month being 2.4% and 3.1%, respectively. Longer PT was associated\nwith a lower graft success rate (P=.008) with success rates of 96.5% for PT of 0-4\ndays, 94.9% for 5-7 days, 93.8% for 8-11 days, and 89.3% for 12-14 days (P=.01). At\n3 years, ECL was 37% (0-7d PT group) and 40% (8-14d PT group) (P=.03). ECL was fairly\nstable between 4 and 13 days PT (N=878, 36% to 43%).\nConclusion: The 3-year success rate post DSAEK was high, irrespective of PT. The rate of primary\ndonor failure was twice as high in the longer vs shorter PT groups. PT impact on graft\nsuccess was small when PT was <12 days. There was slightly greater ECL 3 years\npostop with longer PT while fairly constant with PT 4-13 days. Differences in PT through\n11 days can be expected to have little influence on DSAEK outcomes.","title":"Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty Success and Endothelial Cell  Loss in the Cornea Preservation Time Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180045\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        J.E.B.

It is often\naccompanied by symptoms of burning, stinging, itching, grittiness, and dryness. Current\ntreatments for KCS are limited by time to onset of action and adverse events. Consequently,\nthere is a need for more tolerable drug therapies with a faster onset of action. This\nstudy assessed the ocular safety and efficacy of OTX-101 (cyclosporine A 0.09%) compared\nwith vehicle in subjects with KCS.\nMethods: In this phase 3 multicenter, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study, 745 subjects\nwere randomized 1:1 to receive 1 drop of OTX-101 or vehicle in both eyes twice daily.\nSubjects had conjunctival staining performed using 1 drop of 1% lissamine green solution\nat baseline and all study visits (days 28, 56, and 84 or early discontinuation); scoring\nwas performed 1ˆ’4 minutes after instillation. Six areas of the conjunctiva (zone 1\n= temporal, zones 2 and 4 = superior, zones 3 and 5 = inferior, and zone 6 = nasal)\nwere evaluated and scored on a 0 to 3 scale (0 = no stain in zone, 3 = densely concentrated\nmicropunctate stain spots). For the total conjunctival staining score, the scores\nfor each eye, excluding superior zones 2 and 4, were summed, for a total possible\nscore of 12.\nResults: Of 371 and 373 subjects who received OTX-101 or vehicle, respectively, 347 (93.3%)\nand 361 (96.8%) completed the study. The mean (standard deviation) baseline conjunctival\nscores were 5.42 (1.71) and 5.52 (1.77) for the OTX-101 and vehicle group, respectively.\nAt day 84, the least squares mean change from baseline (standard error) in total conjunctival\nstaining score for subjects receiving OTX-101 was ˆ’1.54 (0.082) vs ˆ’1.15 (0.081) for\nsubjects receiving vehicle, P = 0.0007. A statistically significant difference\nin total conjunctival staining was seen as early as day 56. The mean change from baseline\nwas for subjects receiving OTX-101 was ˆ’1.35 vs ˆ’0.91 for subjects receiving vehicle.\nA total of 20 subjects discontinued due to adverse events (AEs); 17 (4.6%) who received\nOTX-101 and 3 (0.8%) who received vehicle. Overall, ocular AE rates were similar between\nthe groups with instillation site pain the most common. In the OTX-101 group, 90 (24.2%)\nsubjects reported instillation site pain, compared with 16 (4.3%) subjects in the\nvehicle group. Most instillation site pain was mild (20.7%).\nConclusion: Treatment with OTX-101 improves conjunctival surface integrity in patients with KCS,\nas demonstrated by improved total conjunctival staining score, with results seen as\nearly as day 56. OTX-101 was well tolerated in subjects with KSC and demonstrated\nsignificant improvement in the signs of KCS on the ocular surface.","title":"Effect of OTX101 A Novel Nanomicellar Cyclosporine Formulation On Total Conjunctival  Staining Score","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180046\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Private Practice\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Paul Karpecki, Shane Kannarr, Bridgitte Shen Lee, George Varghese, Simon Lowry, April Jasper, Douglas Devries\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Kentucky Eye Institute, Kannarr Eye Care, Vision Optique, Sun Pharma, Sun Pharma, Advanced Eyecare Specialists, Eye Care Associates of Nevada\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hemisfair Ballroom C1\n                    \n            |#|"}

Since any ophthalmic lens that absorbs visible wavelengths will reduce\nretinal illuminance, it is important to understand the impact of this new ophthalmic\nlens on both daytime and nighttime driving performance. The purpose of this study\nwas to evaluate the performance of the photochromic soft CL on vision and driving\nperformance in both daytime and nighttime lighting under real world driving conditions.\nMethods: In a 4-visit bilateral 3x3 crossover study, 24 subjects were randomized to assess\nthe performance of the photochromic soft CL (Test) on vision and driving performance\nby comparison to the non-photochromic soft CL worn without and with plano photochromic\nspectacles (Control 1 and Control 2 respectively). The subjects drove an actual car\non a closed-circuit driving track, with three different routes administered in random\norder and under a range of challenging controlled conditions. Overall driving performance\nwas a composite Z-score based on six objective metrics: average sign recognition distance\n(in meters), percentage of signs correctly identified (42 signs), percentage of hazard\navoidance/detection (9 hazards), average pedestrian recognition distance (in meters),\npercentage of time inside the driving lane, and the inverse driving lap time (in seconds).\nOther vision measures included logMAR visual acuity (ETDRS charts) under various luminance\nand chart contrasts, as well as contrast sensitivity under high luminance (Pelli-Robson\ncharts) and low luminance (Mesotest II) conditions.\nResults: Out of the 24 participants, 58% were female with Mean (SD) age of 29.8 (7.71) [Range:\n21-46 years old]. For nighttime driving, the adjusted mean difference in Z-score (95%\nCI) between Test and Control 1 and between Test and Control 2 were 0.069 (-0.045,\n0.183) and 0.117 (0.003, 0.231), respectively. For daytime driving, the differences\nwere 0.101 (-0.013, 0.216) between Test and Control 1, and 0.044 (-0.070, 0.158) between\nTest and Control2. The results demonstrated the non-inferiority of Test relative to\nthe control lenses with respect to both nighttime and daytime driving performance\nusing a non-inferiority margin of -0.25 Z-score. Non-inferiority (margin 0.1 logMAR),\nor no statistical difference (proportion of letters correctly identified), of the\nTest to Control 1 and Control 2 was also demonstrated on all logMAR and contrast threshold\ntesting.\nConclusion: Subjects wearing the photochromic soft CL during daytime driving, nighttime driving,\nlogMAR and contrast sensitivity testing performed equal or better than when they wore\na non-photochromic CL by itself and when worn in conjunction with plano photochromic\nspectacles.","title":"The Impact of Photochromic Contact Lenses on Daytime and Nighttime Driving Performance","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180047\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Jessica Cannon, Youssef Toubouti\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc., Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Hemisfair Ballroom C1\n                    \n            |#|"}

Here we describe the\ndevelopment of an algorithm to quantify the likelihood of a SCL adverse event based\non CLRS responses.\nMethods: Historical data from survey responses of 832 SCL wearers aged 12 to 33 years (24%\nwith an active red eye event) were used in the analyses.

Unfortunately, CRNFL can flag areas of concern that\nare variants of normal and visual field testing may demonstrate concern without structural\nevidence. En face retinal nerve fiber bundle reflectance allows the clinician to visualize\ndefects within the RNFL as reported by Ashimatey et al (Optom Vis Sci. 2018 Apr;95(4):309-317).\nIn this prospective study, we investigate the impact of en face reflectance imaging\non clinical decision-making for glaucoma suspects.\nMethods: Thirty glaucoma suspects were enrolled from 2 centers (Indiana University and Illinois\nCollege of Optometry). Each subject had a SAP 24-2, CRNFL measurement and 4-6 OCT\nscans that cover the majority of the posterior pole. A custom Matlab program montaged\nand produced en face reflectance images with probabilities based on a previously collected\nnormative database (Figure 1). Six masked investigators (3 from ICO and 3 from IU)\nwere asked if glaucoma was likely present from one each eye each of 30 glaucoma suspects\nusing a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly\nagree). 3 presentations of the subjects' results were randomized and presented to\neach investigator with the first 2 presentations being a standard presentation of\nCRFNL and SAP. The third presentation added en face reflectance imaging. A second\nquestion asked whether en face reflectance was helpful and graded with a 5 point Likert\nscale. An intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were computed for both the second\nstandard and en face added presentations.\nResults: The level of agreement was good amongst the 6 masked investigators for the standard\npresentation (ICC single measures 0.65, average measures 0.92, F value of 13.05 p<0.01).\nWhen adding the en face reflectance, the level of agreement was slightly improved\n(ICC single measures 0.69, average measures 0.93, F value 15.56 p<0.01).

{"_type":"dict","author":"Laura Pardon","url":"https://www.aaopt.org/detail/knowledge-base-article/minimum-rim-width-decreases-over-a-12hour-daytime-period-in-healthy-individuals","text":"Abstract\nPurpose: Minimum rim width (MRW), as quantified using optical coherence tomography (OCT) radial\nscans centered on the optic nerve head, is a sensitive measure for assessing neuroretinal\nrim changes in optic neuropathies such as glaucoma. However, MRW is sensitive to changes\nin intraocular pressure (IOP). While IOP is known to decrease during waking hours,\nnormal variations in MRW remain unknown. The goal of this study was to determine variations\nin MRW over a 12-hour daytime period in young, healthy individuals.\nMethods: Twenty-three healthy human subjects (mean age 29.1 ± 3.7 years; 12 males) were included;\none eye from each subject was randomly selected for scan acquisition and analysis.\nEach subject presented for 7 scan sessions (7AM, 9AM, 11AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM, 7PM) on\nthe same day. During each session, radial OCT scans centered on the optic nerve head,\noptical biometry, 3 IOP measurements (iCare), and blood pressure were acquired. Intra-subject\nvariability in MRW was assessed by obtaining repeat OCT scans at randomly selected\nsessions.\nResults: The intra-subject standard deviation for global MRW was 1.19 µm. MRW significantly\ndecreased from the 7AM session (median = 356 µm, interquartile range [IQR] = 280 to\n402 µm) to 7PM (median = 343 µm, IQR = 276 to 389 µm; p < 0.0001). On average,\nthis change occurred from 7AM to 3PM (slope = -1.0 µm/hour, standard error = ± 0.17),\nand MRW remained stable from 3PM to 7PM. The median difference in MRW between 7AM\nand 7PM was -8 µm (range = -31 to +1 µm). There was a significant decrease in mean\nIOP (16.5 ± 3.2 vs. 15.0 ± 2.4 mmHg; p = 0.01) and increase in mean arterial pressure\n(86.7 ± 7.5 vs. 89.9 ± 8.9 mmHg; p = 0.0006) from 7AM to 7PM. Axial length did not\nchange over the 12-hour period (p = 0.53).\nConclusion: In healthy individuals, MRW decreases from morning to late afternoon hours. This is\ninconsistent with the decrease in IOP during the same period, as previous studies\nhave demonstrated a decrease in MRW with increasing IOP and vice versa. One possible\nexplanation is that the translaminar pressure gradient (IOP - intracranial pressure)\nfavors neuroretinal rim increase in the supine position overnight, which is reversed\nwhen one wakes and is either sitting or standing. The findings of the present study\nsuggest that MRW should be measured at approximately the same time of day when managing\npatients with or suspected of glaucoma. Future studies will investigate whether individual\ndifferences in the extent of MRW variation are a reflection of the translaminar pressure\ngradient and whether they may predict risk of glaucoma development and progression.","title":"Minimum Rim Width Decreases Over a 12hour Daytime Period in Healthy Individuals","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180035\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Faith McAllister, Han Cheng, Nimesh Patel\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry, University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

We explored how the the PhNR amplitude from the macula\nof glaucoma patients compared to behavioral visual sensitivity and retinal ganglion\ncell structural integrity of the macula.\nMethods: Multifocal ERGs were recorded with an Espion system from 11 open angle glaucoma patients\nand 11 age-matched controls. The stimulus consisted of a 10 degree circular patch\ndivided into four quadrants. The 13ms white stimulus (1000cd/m\n2\n) followed\nby 400 ms of blank frames was presented on a white background (30cd/m\n2\n).\nSuperior and inferior hemifield responses were obtained by adding responses of respective\nquadrants. PhNR amplitude was measured at a fixed time from baseline. Visual field\nsensitivity was assessed with the Humphry Field Analyzer using the 10-2 protocol.\nThe sensitivity values at each test location was converted to linear units and averaged\nacross the field to derive mean sensitivity measures. Average Retinal Ganglion Cell\nPlus Inner Plexiform layer (RGC+) thickness was assessed with the Spectralis OCT,\nfrom the central 10 degrees by sampling the thickness every 200Î¼ across 25 horizontal\nscans performed every 259Î¼. Unpaired student t-test was used to evaluate the statistical\nsignificance of differences with p values adjusted for multiple comparisons using\nHolms correction.\nResults: PhNR amplitudes of glaucoma patients were significantly reduced relative to age-matched\ncontrols in both superior and inferior hemifields (by 76%, p=0.01 and 52%, 0.016).\nCorrespondingly, RGC+ thickness showed a greater more significant reduction in the\ninferior relative to the superior retina (by 33%, p=0.00018 and 15%, p=0.00125). However,\nwhile both hemifields showed a reduction in visual field sensitivity (by 54% and 38%),\nonly the change in the superior field reached statistical significance (p=0.018 vs\np=0.062). The PhNR amplitudes of glaucoma patients were always reduced when visual\nfield sensitivity and/or RGC+ thickness was reduced. Furthermore, PhNR amplitudes\nwere reduced in most hemifields when visual field sensitivity and to a lesser degree\nRGC+ thickness was normal. However, the magnitude of the PhNR amplitude change in\nglaucomatous eyes were not graded with either the magnitude of the visual sensitivity\nloss or RGC+ thickness change.\nConclusion: PhNR amplitude in the macula of glaucoma patients is significantly reduced when visual\nfield sensitivity and to a less extent RGC+ thickness is normal suggesting that this\nERG measure could be an early objective biomarker of RGC health in glaucoma. The lack\nof significant correlation between PhNR amplitude and visual field sensitivity/RGC+\nthickness may suggest that factors other than RGC dysfunction may contribute to PhNR\nreduction in glaucoma.","title":"Macular PhNR of the Focal ERG in Glaucoma Comparison with Visual Field Sensitivity  and RGC Thickness","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180036\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York, College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Emily Freeman, Nabin Joshi, Mitchell Dul, Suresh Viswanathan\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        State University of New York, College of Optometry, State University of New York, College of Optometry, State University of New York, College of Optometry, State University of New York, College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Although there have been\nnumerous advances in surgical management to repair the retina, the continuous scarring\nin the eye after surgery eventually leads to severe vision loss or blindness. Effective\ntherapeutics are not available to treat this blinding disorder. The results of this\nstudy will be used to determine the optimal time points for later studies designed\nto test treatment strategies.\nMethods: To study ocular fibrosis in animal models, a detailed classification system has been\ndeveloped. Intraocular fibrosis in animals is graded according to the Fastenberg scale\nof classification: stage 0, no disease; stage 1, epiretinal membrane formation; stage\n2, vitreoretinal traction without retinal detachment; stage 3, localized retinal detachment;\nstage 4, extensive retinal detachment ; stage 5, complete retinal detachment. For\nthis study, 10 male Dutch Belted rabbits were anesthetized and divided into two groups\nas shown in Table1. Group A received a penetrating eye injury and was terminated\non Day 14. Group B received penetrating eye injury and was terminated on Day 28. Posterior\npenetrating eye injury was induced in the right eye with the left eye acting as the\nuninjured control. Injured and control animals were examined by intraocular pressure\nmeasurement, indirect ophthalmoscope, fundus photography, and electroretinography\nonce a week until the termination of the experiment. Group A was euthanized on Day\n14 to determine fibrosis at an early phase of disease progression. Group B was euthanized\non Day 28 to examine fibrosis at a late phase of disease progression. The eyes were\nprocessed for histology and immunofluorescence labeling of fibrotic proteins alpha-smooth\nmuscle actin and collagen I.\nResults: Rabbits were examined at both 14 and 28 days post injury. Early fibrosis was detected\nby day 14, as indicated by indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus imaging. Fibrotic membranes\nwere visible at the site of the original injury. Immunofluorescence analysis detected\nalpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen I within the fibrotic membranes.\nConclusion: These data have shown that ocular fibrosis can be detected within 14 days after the\ninitial injury, with more severe fibrosis detected at 28 days post-injury. The detection\nof intraocular fibrosis at any stage from 1 to 5, at any time point, was considered\nsuccessful development of this model.","title":"A Rabbit Model of Penetrating Eye Injury Leading to Intraocular Fibrosis in the Posterior  Segment","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180028\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        United States Army Institute of Surgical Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Teresa Burke, Gregory Bramblett, Heuy-Ching Wang\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        United States Army Institute of Surgical Research, United States Army Institute of Surgical Research, United States Army Institute of Surgical Research\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and type of CIEs\nseen with bi-weekly disposable hydrogel antimicrobial contact lens wear compared with\na control lens wear over three months of extended wear.\nMethods: A prospective, randomized, double-masked, contralateral, extended contact lens wear\nclinical trial was conducted with 176 subjects. The study received ethics approval\n(HREC#15436) and was registered with Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry\n(ACTRN1261500072556). Antimicrobial contact lenses were produced by coating with Mel4\n(Melimine) peptide as reported earlier. Subjects were 18 to 42 years of age (22.6\n± 4.2) and had refractive errors ranging from a -0.75 dioptre (D) sphere to a -6.50\nD sphere with a cylinder ? -1.50 D. The contact lenses were removed and replaced at\n14-day intervals over a period of three months. Follow-up visits were conducted after\none-night, two-weeks, one-month and three-months of lens wear, including a non-lens\nwear follow-up after one-month of discontinuing the lens wear. The main outcome measures\nwere the incidences of CIEs per 100 eye-months and rate of discontinuations.\nResults: A total of one hundred and thirty-five subjects completed the study; 73% were neophytes.\nMicrobial keratitis did not occur. Nine CIEs was seen, three with Mel4-coated lens\nwear (0.7 events per 100 eyes per month) and six with control lens wear (1.3 events\nper 100 eyes per month; p = 0.508). With the Mel4-coated lens, the incidence of contact\nlens-induced acute red eye (CLARE) and infiltrative keratitis (IK) was 0.4 and 0.2\nevents per 100 eyes per month respectively, while with the control lens wear, the\nincidence rates were 0.9 and 0.4 for the same CIEs respectively.

Recently, there has been evidence that this molecule functions as an antioxidant\nand protects the oxidation of deposited lipids within the contact lens. The aim of\nthis study was to investigate if this UV-blocker also could protect protein (i.e.\nlysozyme) that integrate into the contact lens during wear from oxidative damage.\nMethods: Etafilcon A was prepared with specific levels of UV-blocker (i.e. 0, 0.95,\nand 1.8 wt%) in addition to commercially available etafilcon A (2 wt%) and each composition\nwas subjected to a 72 hour incubation with lysozyme in phosphate-buffered saline (2\nmg/mL) followed by exposure to controlled in vitro oxidative conditions (i.e.\n3% hydrogen peroxide in deionized water (pH 7) under 24 hours of ultraviolet light\n(l=365 nm) at 1.9 mW/cm\n2\n). Cross-polarization magic angle spinning\n13\nC\nNMR was used to quantify the amount of lysozyme integrated within the contact lens\nand detect changes to deposits after oxidation.\nResults: The presence of UV-blocker (0.95, 1.8, and 2 wt%) in etafilcon A protects lysozyme\nfrom oxidative damage. We demonstrate that lenses that contain any amount of UV-blocker\n(as low as 0.95 wt%) retain similar amounts of lysozyme within their matrices (i.e.\napprox. 10-14 wt% within the dried hydrogel material) after exposure to oxidative\nconditions, while lenses without UV-blocker show complete dissociation of lysozyme\nfrom the material under oxidative conditions, likely due to oxidative cleavage of\nlysozyme within hydrogel lens. We confirmed that when lysozyme is subjected to oxidation\nconditions prior to incubation with commercial etafilcon A (2 wt% UV-blocker), lysozyme\nis not taken up by the contact lens.\nConclusion: Our findings support the importance of UV-blocker as a protectant from tear film component\noxidative damage and suggest a potential benefit to contact lens patients.","title":"Investigating the Role of UVblocker as an Antioxidant to Prevent Oxidation of Tear  Film Component Deposition in Commercial Contact Lens Hydrogels","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180031\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Stanford University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Charles Scales, Gerald Fuller, Lynette Cegelski\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Stanford University, Stanford University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

It is therefore, imperative to understand the influence of the\nloss of photoreceptors on the inner retinal neurons.The extent of remodeling of inner\nretinal neurons due to photoreceptor degeneration in X-linked RP2 is not completely\nunderstood.

This age was selected to mimic the condition of already\nprogressed disease. The eyes were enucleated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution\nand processed for cryosectioning. Sections were permeabilized, blocked for 1 hour,\nincubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4\n0\nC followed by\nincubation with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore. DAPI was\nalso used to label the nuclei and the sections were mounted under glass coverslips\nfollowed by analysis using a fluorescence microscope. The rod photoreceptors were\nlabeled with rhodopsin antibody. The bipolar cells were identified by labeling with\nProtein Kinase C alpha (PKCÎ±) and the astrocytes/Muller glia were stained with Glial\nfibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody.\nResults: Reduced expression of PKCÎ± at the bipolar cell synaptic layer (outer plexiform layer)\nwas observed in the Rpgr\nko\nmice as compared to the wild type mice.\nIncreased GFAP expression was also detected in the Rpgr\nko\nmice\nunlike that of wild type mice.\nConclusion: Our results show that Rpgr ablation leads to remodeling of the outer plexiform\nlayer through reduced synaptic connections of rod bipolar cells with photoreceptors.\nIncreased GFAP expression in the Rpgr\nnull\nmice represented active\ngliosis by the Muller glia to cope up with the stress response of the degenerating\nretina. This study can serve as a basis for further exploring appropriate therapeutic\nstrategies for XLRP attributed to RPGR mutations.","title":"Influence of Loss of Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator RPGR Gene on Inner Retinal  Neurons In A Mouse Model of Retinitis Pigmentosa","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180025\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry, MCPHS University\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Alaina Short, Ramesh Periasamy, Mahesh Shivanna, Hemant Khanna\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        School of Optometry, MCPHS University, UMASS Medical School, School of Optometry, MCPHS University, UMASS Medical School\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

After the first week, FD eyes also received daily\ntopical A) latanoprost (Lat, 0.005%, n=2) or B) artificial tears (AT; n=2). At the\nend of the treatment period, animals were sacrificed, eyes enucleated and optic nerve\nheads (ONH) excised to include a 4 mm diameter ring of surrounding sclera for scanning\nelectron microscopy (SEM), and an additional 6 mm ring of sclera surrounding the ONH\nwas excised for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Tissue samples were fixed\nin 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate, then embedded and sectioned. For SEM,\nONH samples were first immersed in 0.2M NaOH for 30 h to remove cellular components,\nleaving only collagenous structures. All samples were stained with osmium tetroxide,\ndried through an ethanol series and finally subjected to critical point drying before\nimaging. Image J was used to analyze the dimensions of laminar pores (SEM images)\nand scleral collagen fibers (TEM images).\n\nResults: FD myopic eyes treated with AT exhibited smaller and more variable scleral fiber cross-sectional\nareas compared to untreated (contralateral) eyes, consistent with the scleral changes\nreported for human myopia. In contrast, the scleral fiber areas of the Lat-treated\nFD eyes were similar to those of contralateral eyes. Laminar pore sizes were similar\nfor FD eyes and their contralateral fellows, for both treatment groups. See data table.\nConclusion: As previously reported for these animals, Latanoprost was effective in inhibiting\nmyopia progression in FD eyes of young guinea pigs (El-Nimri et al, ARVO 2017). Despite\nreports of increased uveoscleral extracellular matrix remodeling with Lat, these preliminary\nresults further suggest that its daily topical use does not exacerbate myopia-related\nchanges in scleral collagen or lamina cribosa. Instead, Lat appears to inhibit the\nusual increased scleral remodeling effect of FD. These results lend further support\nits use for myopia control.","title":"Effect of Topical Latanoprost on Lamina Cribrosa and Sclera of Myopic Guinea Pigs","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180026\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California, Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Melissa Yao, Andrea Huerta, Michelle Hoang, Anna Barcellos, Christine Wildsoet\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

In this study we investigated\nthe neuroprotective effectiveness of MaR-1 in preserving retinal tissue when administered\nintravenously following blast exposure in a blast-induced eye injury model.\nMethods: A compressed-air driven shock tube was used to expose anesthetized adult male Long-Evan\nrats to shock waves simulating an open-field blast exposure. Blast waves of peak overpressure\nof 123 ± 4 kPa and a positive phase duration of 3.34 ± 0.05 ms were used. The overpressure\nspecific impulse was 148 ± 3 kPa-ms. Anesthetized rats were exposed once to a blast\nwave and approximately 30 minutes after blast exposure, rats were treated with either\n0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 µg/kg MaR-1, or vehicle, delivered via tail vein injection. Rats\nwere euthanized 48 hours after blast exposure. Unexposed rats were included as controls.\nThe retina tissue was subjected to immunohistochemistry, ELISA and western blots analyses\nfor glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as an indicator of gliosis. Tissues were\nevaluated for relative levels of positive GFAP signals compared to unexposed controls.\nResults:\nMicroglial reactivity was detected as an increase in the level of GFAP expression\nthroughout the retina of both the right and left eyes in vehicle blast- and blast\nonly- exposed at 48 hour post blast exposure as compared to controls. Approximately,\n2-folds increase in GFAP levels occurred in the retinal tissue from blast-exposed\nrats as compared to controls. However, blast-exposed rats treated with MaR-1 showed\na dose-dependent reduction in GFAP levels in the retinal tissue. ELISA and Western\nblot analysis showed MaR-1 reduced GFAP protein expression levels in retinal homogenates\nat 48 hour post blast exposure compared to blast-exposed only and blast-exposed with\nvehicle rats.\nConclusion: Primary blast exposure resulting in retinal damage, manifested by increased expression\nof proteins involved in gliosis, was reduced by MaR-1 intervention. Thus the treatments\nof MaR-1 suggest an effective strategy to reduce or halt retina glia cells activation\ndue to primary blast wave exposures.

A total of 61 subjects\nwere enrolled (40 subjects of age 18 to 39, and 21 of age 40 to 65) and randomized\nto wear a senofilcon A based contact lens with photochromic additive (Test) in either\nthe left or right eye and a senofilcon A based contact lens without photochromic additive\n(Control) in the other eye. The photochromic was partially activated during testing\nwith a steady state transmittance of approximately 62%. The primary endpoint was visual\noutcome and this was based on measuring photostress recovery (PSR), glare disability\n(GD), glare discomfort (GDC), and chromatic contrast (CC). Iris color and macular\npigment density were assessed as control variables. PSR was quantified by measuring\nthe time needed to recover visual acquisition of a grating target after five seconds\nof an intense xenon white flash exposure (matched to the spectrum of sunlight); GD\nwas evaluated as the energy in a surrounding xenon white annulus necessary to veil\na central grating target; GDC was assessed using bio-imaging of the squint response.\nCC was measured as thresholds for a yellow grating target superposed on a 460-nm background\n(matched to sky light).\nResults: PSR was 44% faster using the tinted photochromic compared to the control and the eye\nwearing the photochromic had 39% less squint (GDC) compared to the control. GD was\nimproved by 36% in the photochromic vs. control (less GD) and CC was enhanced by 33%\nin the photochromic (all p values <0.05).\nConclusion: There was a clear benefit to visual function when comparing the activated photochromic\ncontact lens with a transparent contact lens on the same individual. This significant\nbenefit was seen specifically with respect to photostress recovery time, glare discomfort,\nand glare disability when using light stress matched to daylight sun.

Clinical testing included non-invasive tear break-up\ntime (NITBUT), tear meniscus height (TMH), meibomian gland function (expression and\nplugging), and meibography (OCULUS Keratograph 5M). MG atrophy was graded subjectively\non a 0 to 3 scale by eyelid for each eye; atrophy was categorized as significant if\nthe upper or lower eyelid grade was ? 2 or the total grade for both upper and lower\neyelids was ? 4.

This study investigated\nwhether the change in LWE score is observed over a 9-hour day in LWE height (H domain)\nor LWE width (W domain) for soft contact lens (SCL) and non-contact lens wearers (NCL).\nMethods: Twenty-nine subjects (15 SCL and 14 NCL) previously diagnosed with LWE were examined\nat 4 time points on a single day (approximately 9AM, 12PM, 3PM and 6PM). A solution\nof 2% Sodium Fluorescein /1% Lissamine Green was instilled in the eye and photographs\nof the lid wiper region were taken. Lid photographs were graded using a 0-3 grading\nscale by 2 masked, experienced examiners and an average score of the 2 examiners for\nLWE height and width was used in the analysis. Change over time for the H domain and\nW domain was assessed using non-parametric analysis.\nResults: For the NCL group, no statistically significant change was observed between the 4\ntime points for the H or W domains for the upper eyelid. For the SCL group, a significant\ndifference between the 4 time points was observed for both the H domain (p=0.045)\nand W domain (p=0.003) of the upper eyelid. Controlling for a false discovery rate\nof 25% with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, post-hoc analysis revealed significant\ndifferences for the H domain, upper lid, between the 9AM and 12, 3 and 6 PM visits\n(p=0.022, p=0.005, p=0.013, respectively). For the W domain, significant differences\nwere observed between the 9AM and 12, 3 and 6 PM visits (p=0.123, p=0.004, p=0.003,\nrespectively), as well as between 12PM and 3PM and 12PM and 6PM visits (p=0.009, p=0.018,\nrespectively). For upper lid LWE height, the median (interquartile range) grading\nscore at 9AM was 0.00 (0.00-0.50), at 12PM was 1.00 (0.00-1.50), at 3PM was 1.00 (0.50-2.00)\nand at 6PM was 1.00 (0.50-1.50). For upper lid LWE width, the median (interquartile\nrange) grading score at 9AM was 0.00 (0.00-1.50), at 12PM was 1.00 (0.00-2.00), at\n3PM was 2.00 (0.50-3.00) and at 6PM was 2.00 (0.50-3.00).\nConclusion: No changes in LWE height and width were observed during the day for the NCL group.\nFor the SCL group, LWE staining score changes for the upper eyelid during a day were\nnot driven by a single domain, but are a combination of change in LWE height and width;\nhowever, LWE width score may contribute more to observed changes throughout a day.\nThis observed increase in LWE staining may be due to the interaction between the contact\nlens surface and the lid wiper region.","title":"Variation in Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy LWE Height and Width Scores during the Course  of a Day in Contact Lens and NonContact Lens Wearers","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180020\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        The University of Houston College of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Daniel Powell, Carolina Kunnen, James Wolffsohn\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, Alcon Research, Ltd, Aston University, UK\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Wear habits such as irregular replacement of the storage\ncase and poor hand hygiene have been associated with CL storage case contamination.\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the effect of water contact behaviour on\nCL storage case contamination.\nMethods: One hundred daily wear reusable CL wearers completed a self-administered CL hygiene\nquestionnaire. Used CL storage cases were collected, and microbial analysis was conducted\nusing a bacterial ATP assay. A water contact behaviour scoring system (0: excellent,\n10: poor) was devised to determine the overall water exposure during CL wear. Logistic\nregression was used to determine the association between water contact behaviours\nand CL storage case contamination.\nResults: Of the 100 participants, 67% were female. The average age was 32 years (range, 18-62\nyears) and the study population was predominantly tertiary students (65/100). Average\nCL storage case contamination was 3.12 (± 0.98) Log CFU/mL (range, 1.40 to 5.94 Log\nCFU/mL). Water contact behaviours included swimming while wearing CLs (49/100) without\nswimming goggles (32/49) and showering (43/100) while wearing CLs. One third of the\nparticipants used wet hands to handle CLs and 17/100 used tap water to rinse their\nCL storage cases. Using tap water to rinse (5/100) and store (1/100) CLs were the\nleast prevalent practices. Overall water contact behaviour score was significantly\nassociated with CL storage case contamination (p <0.01). Multiple regression showed\nonly showering while wearing CL was independently associated with CL storage case\ncontamination (p <0.01).\nConclusion: Water contact behaviour such as showering while wearing CLs is prevalent among CL\nwearers and is independently associated CL storage case contamination. Minimizing\nwater contact behaviour may lead to reduced storage case contamination and ultimately\nlower the risk of CL-related adverse events.","title":"The Effect of Contact Lens Wearers Water Exposure on Storage Case Contamination","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180021\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of New South Wales\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Nicole Carnt, Jacqueline Tan, Fiona Stapleton\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of New South Wales, University of New South Wales, University of New South Wales\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

Epithelial-mesenchymal\ntransition (EMT) of lens epithelial cells (LECs) plays a key role in the pathogenesis\nof PCO. While transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) is a potent inducer of EMT in\nthe lens, other growth factors in the aqueous humour such as epidermal growth factor\n(EGF) are important for normal lens cellular processes. The aim of the present study\nwas to investigate the combined effect of TGFÎ² and EGF in the lens to elucidate the\nrole of EGFR-signaling in TGFÎ²-induced EMT.\nMethods: Lens epithelial explants from 21-day-old Wistar rats were treated with either 5 ng/ml\nEGF, 200 pg/ml TGFÎ²2 or a combination of these, with or without a 2-hour pre-treatment\nwith 50 nM PD153035 (EGFR inhibitor). Expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA),\ntropomyosin (isoforms 1.6-1.9; CGÎ²6 Ab), Î²-catenin and downstream signaling molecules,\nincluding phosphorylated EGFR, Smad2/3 and MAPK/ERK1/2 were determined using immunofluorescence\nand/or western blotting.\nResults: Co-treatment of TGFÎ²2 and EGF resulted in a more pronounced morphological elongation\nof LECs into myofibroblastic cells compared to TGFÎ²2 alone. The addition of EGF augmented\nthe protein levels of EMT markers (Î±-SMA and tropomyosin) compared to TGFÎ²2 alone.\nTreatment with EGF alone did not upregulate EMT markers. Co-treatment with TGFÎ²2 and\nEGF upregulated unique activation profiles of Smad2/3, ERK1/2 and the EGFR signaling\npathways compared to either growth factor alone. Intriguingly, pharmacologic inhibition\nof EGFR-signaling using PD153035 inhibited TGFÎ²2-induced EMT by blocking the upregulation\nof Î±-SMA and tropomyosin and retaining Î²-catenin to the cell membrane.\nConclusion: Our findings show that TGFÎ²2 cooperates synergistically with EGF to enhance EMT in\nthe lens. Moreover, as TGFÎ²2 alone can transactivate EGFR signaling, and EGFR-signaling\nis required for TGFÎ²-induced EMT, we reveal a novel positive feedback mechanism in\nthe pathogenesis of PCO. Hence, targeting both TGFÎ²2 and EGFR activity serves as a\npotential pharmacological treatment for PCO.","title":"Exacerbation of Transforming Growth FactorBeta TGFÎ²Induced Fibrotic Cataract Using  Epidermal Growth Factor EGF A Novel Mechanism in the Pathogenesis of Posterior  Capsular Opacification PCO","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180022\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Sydney\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Frank Lovicu\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Sydney\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

OSC rate was estimated using\nthe FLIR Tools+ software. Subjects were divided into cooling and non-cooling sub-groups\nbased on OSC rate. Along with visual inspection of the data, a threshold of -0.021\ndeg C/sec was determined based on > 1 SD slower OSC than the mean OSC rate of -0.057\ndeg C/sec originally reported by Li, et al.

This study sought to identify specific membrane receptors,\nvia flow cytometry, that could distinguish differences in neutrophil phenotype to\ndifferentiate normal and dry eyes.\nMethods: In this pilot study, eight normal and nine dry eye human participants were recruited\nand trained to wash the ocular surface with phosphate buffered saline for at-home\nself-collection of tear leukocytes immediately following a full night of sleep (closed\neye). Unstimulated tear leukocytes were incubated with a panel of fluorescently-labeled\nantibodies to determine the activation phenotype of neutrophils. Intracellular production\nof IL-17a was assessed using the transcription factor buffer set (BD Biosciences;\nSan Jose, CA). Flow cytometry was performed using a BD LSR II. To compare dry eye\nversus normals, Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables and the t-test\nor Wilcoxon rank sums test was used for normally and non-normally distributed continuous\nvariables. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient.\nResults: Dry eye participants were significantly more symptomatic, as measured by both the\nDEQ5 and OSDI (p < 0.001). Dry eye participants also had a shorter non-invasive\nbreak up time (p < 0.01), and more often tested positive on the InflammaDry (Quidel;\nSan Diego, CA) test (p < 0.01) than the normal participants. Expression of multiple\nmembrane receptors related to degranulation, CD66, CD66b, and CD63 were significantly\nupregulated in dry eye participants' closed eye neutrophils (p < 0.04). Membrane\nreceptor expression of CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD184 (CXCR4) were also both upregulated\nin dry eye participants' neutrophils (p < 0.02).

A weak negative correlation was observed\nbetween IL-17 and CD66b expression in closed eye neutrophils (Spearman coefficient:\n-0.42, p = 0.09)\nConclusion: CD66b and CD63 upregulation in dry eye suggests complete degranulation of neutrophils\nin dry eye disease, which could be a potential source of inflammatory mediators like\nmatrix metalloproteinases and neutrophil elastase in the tears. These membrane receptors\ncould be an important biomarker for dyregulation associated with dry eye disease,\nand warrant study in a larger cohort.","title":"Closed Eye Neutrophil Degranulation is Associated with Dry Eye Disease","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180012\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Katherine Held, Thomas Swain, Veena Viswanath, Gerald McGwin, Kelly Nichols\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Allergan, LLC, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Allergan, LLC, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Birmingham\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

SPEED score was significantly associated\nwith MG contrast (p=0.001) but not with percent atrophy (p=0.173) in this study group.\nConclusion: Decreased MG contrast appears to be a potential risk factor for lipid-deficient dry\neye and should be considered when evaluating for dry eye disease, especially when\nMG atrophy is minimal or tear lipid assessment is not possible.","title":"Meibomian Gland Contrast as Indicator of LipidDeficient Dry Eye A CaseControl Study","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180013\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California, Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Meng Lin\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of California, Berkeley\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is the\nleading cause of dry eye. Regulation of MG activity including remodeling of the MG\ncells extracellular matrix during holocrine secretion of meibum is thought to involve\nphysiological levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Increasingly, MGD and MGD-related\ndry eye are thought to have a significant inflammatory component. Whether MGD and\nMGD-related dry eye involves dysregulated expression of MMPs and/or inflammatory cytokines\nby MG cells is unknown.\nPurpose: To determine if human meibomian gland\nepithelial cells (HMGEC) are capable of increasing dry eye inflammation via modulation\nof MMPs and/or inflammatory cytokines\nMethods: Immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cells (HMGEC) were subjected to the\nfollowing in vitro dry eye-like conditions: sodium chloride induced-hyperosmolar\nstress (450mM), IL- 1Î² (10ng/ml), TNF-Î± (10ng/ml), or IFN-Î³ (200U/ml) for 24 hours\nat 37°C. Cell culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for secreted IL-6,\nIL-8 and TNF-Î± protein using ELISA. Cell lysates were isolated for quantitation of\nMMP-9 and its inhibitor, TIMP-1 gene expression using quantitative PCR. All experiments\nwere conducted in triplicate and data was statistically analyzed using ANOVA.\nResults: Dry eye associated cytokine, TNF-Î± increased MMP-9 mRNA expression by 39.19 ± 6.76-fold\n(P ?0.0001). Hyperosmolar stress increased expression of MMP-9 although this change\nwas not significant when compared to the untreated control; while IL-1Î² and IFN-Î³\ndid not modulate MMP-9. None of dry-eye like treatments significantly modified TIMP-1\nmRNA expression. Regarding cytokine protein secretion, IL-1Î² increased IL-8 (713.6\n± 11.3 pg/ml, P ?0.0001) and TNF-Î± (443.3 ± 62.5pg/ml, P ?0.0001) compared to the\nuntreated control (55.9±13.1 pg/ml). Although TNF-Î± increased IL-6 and TNF-Î± protein\nsecretion, these changes were not significant.\nConclusion: Dry eye-like conditions increased MMP-9 mRNA and IL-8 protein secretion in MG cells\nin vitro. Our data suggest that MG contribution in dry eye is not limited to\ninsufficient or poor quality meibum secretion, but may also contribute to increasing\nMMP-9 and inflammatory mediators on the ocular surface that perpetuate dry eye disease.","title":"Dry Eye Modulates MMP9 and Inflammatory Cytokines In Meibomian Gland Cells iIn  Vitroi","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180014\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carolina Lema, Rachel Redfern\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

The preferred treatment for limbal stem\ncell deficiency is stem cell transplantation, however, the ex vivo expansion\nof LSCs while maintaining their stemness and graft rejection are limitations to this\nform of treatment. We recently found that hyaluronan (HA) is a vital component of\nthe LSC niche. This study aims to investigate the role of HA in maintaining the LSC\nphenotype during ex vivo culture.\nMethods: The limbal region and central corneal buttons were dissected from human donor corneas\nfor the isolation of LSCs and corneal epithelial cells (CECs) respectively. The isolated\ncells were seeded on dishes pre-coated with FNC ® coating mix (FNC) or collagen IV\nand analyzed between passages 1 and 3. Cells were treated with 1U hyaluronidase and\n4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) for 24 hours to reduce HA in the extracellular matrix.\nThe identity and differentiation status of the cells were analyzed by immunocytochemistry\nusing anti-cytokeratin-15 (K15) and anti-Î”Np63. The percentage of cells positive for\nputative stem cell markers to the total number of cells was quantified and analyzed\nfor each condition in ImageJ software.\nResults: The percentage of cells in the LSC cultures positive for stem cell markers were 24.49%\nfor the FNC coating and 19.39% for collagen IV coating. However, for the cells treated\nwith hyaluronidase and 4MU, the percentages of positive cells were 21.31% on FNC coat\nand 14.61% on collagen IV coat. Also, 4MU and hyaluronidase treatment led to an increase\nin cell proliferation. The HA levels, quantified as integrated density from the images,\nwere reduced after the treatment with hyaluronidase and 4MU by more than 3-folds.\nThe cells cultured on collagen IV and FNC coating mix had comparatively more cells\nin total but fewer cells positive for stem cell markers after they were treated to\nreduce the quantity of HA in the extracellular matrix.\nConclusion: Our data indicates that hyaluronan matrix is important for the maintenance of LSC\nphenotype in ex vivo expansion of LSCs for stem cell transplantation in the\ntreatment of limbal stem cell deficiency.","title":"Role of Extracellular Matrix Component Hyaluronan in iex vivo iCulture of Limbal  Stem Cells","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180015\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Mingxia Sun, Nadine Mutoji, Vivien Coulson-Thomas\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        University of Houston, University of Houston, University of Houston\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

However, this\ncell layer poses great challenges for clinicians due to its lack of regenerative potential\nand reducing cell population with age. This study investigates the potential of human\ncorneal endothelial cells (HCEC), loaded with iron-based nanoparticles, to be magnetically-directed\nto injured regions of the cornea.\nMethods: Primary cultures of human HCEC from CellProgen were maintained in human endothelial\nserum free media containing 10 ng/ml FGF-2 and plated at 75,000 cells in a 48 well\nplate for 24 hours. Cells were then exposed to 50nm dextran-coated biotin conjugated\nsuper paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONP) at 37°C for up to 48 hours in\nserum free media. Western blot, PCR, and Prussian Blue staining were utilized to evaluate\nuptake of nanoparticles and cellular response by SPIONP dose. Mathematic modeling\nbased upon stokes law, gravity, and magnetic field strength as well as fluid flow\ndynamics and outflow of the aqueous chamber was used to determine optimum SPIONP cell\nloading in relation to magnetic field strength for induced cellular movement within\nthe aqueous chamber. Mathematical modeling efficacy was then evaluated by injecting\nSPIONP loaded HCECs onto a denuded human corneal endothelium in the presence of an\napplied magnetic field.\nResults: HCEC were successfully cultured and maintained their in-vivo marker expression of\nCD200. PCR revealed there was dose dependent impact on cell pump expression with SPIONP\nloading and an optimized loading dose was determined. When SPIONP loaded-HCEC were\nplaced in solution with the denuded cornea, up to 1 million cells/mL, the cells showed\ntargeted movement through the solution towards the externally applied magnetic field\nof 1.23 Tesla.\nConclusion: These studies show that HCEC maintained their lineage after readily incorporating\nSPIONPs. Proof of concept studies performed here indicate that cells with internally-loaded\nSPIONP can be directed and manipulated through an aqueous solution to a predetermined\narea when a magnetic field is applied. Mathematical modeling of the cell loading capacity\nand magnetic strength needed for this movement to occur can be an effective tool for\ntailoring specific ocular therapeutic needs for patients.

Patients were stratified by age and categories of DED treatment. Prescribed\nDED treatments were grouped into 4 levels of intensity, based in part, on the step-wise\ntreatment algorithm described in the Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS II) Tear Film report.\nPatients who were prescribed treatments in groups 1 through 4 were considered to have\nmild, moderate, moderate-severe, or severe disease, respectively.\nResults: Of the ~2.8 million prevalent patients with DED identified in the IRIS registry in\n2017, 47.7% had a record of at least one DED-specific prescribed treatment or procedure/surgery.\nThe remaining patients, who had no record of a prescribed treatment for DED, were\nuntreated or may have used over-the-counter (OTC) eye drops, gels, or ointments. Overall,\nwomen were more likely to receive treatment for DED than men (49.6% women vs. 43.2%\nmen). Treated patients were classified into the following treatment groups: Group\n1 (topical and systemic omega-3 fatty acids), 4.7%; Group 2 (ocular anti-inflammatory\nagents, Xiidra® and Restasis®), 16.7%; Group 3 (topical corticosteroids, non-thermal\nor collagen punctal plugs occlusion), 56.6%; Group 4 (tetracyclines, cholinergic agonists,\nanti-inflammatory agents, mucolytic agents, punctal occlusion by thermocauterization,\nligation or laser surgery, or tarsorrhaphy), 22.1%. The most intense treatments were\nmore often prescribed to older patients with 14.9% of those aged 18-29 being categorized\ninto Group 4, 15.6% of those 30-39, 17.8% of those 40-49, 20.6% of those 50-59, 23.3%\nof those 60-69, 23.8% of those 70-79, and 21.5% of those ?80 years.

In this study, we measure the\narea and effect of repeated TBU on sensory thresholds.\nMethods: Twenty-five subjects participated in a training visit and two visits during which\ndetection thresholds to (1) cool and (2) mechanical and chemical stimuli were measured\nusing a computerized Belmonte esthesiometer before, immediately after and 30 minutes\nafter subjects completed 10 consecutive STARE trials. Subjects kept the tested eye\nopen as long as possible during STARE trials, to induce TBU and thinning. Subjects\nfilled out the Current Symptom Questionnaire (CSQ) corresponding to the time of threshold\nmeasurement. To measure the area of TBU in each trial, an observer masked to subject\nor STARE trial information set the threshold pixel intensity for TBU in the final\nimages of each trial. TBU was calculated as the percentage of TBU within the exposed\ncornea area (ROI). Repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction were used to\ndetermine significant differences between threshold measures at different time periods.\nResults: Thresholds (mean ± SEM) before, immediately after STARE and 30 minutes later were\n61.20 ± 4.94, 58.73 ± 4.54 and 52.40 ± 3.77 to cool, 39.53 ± 4.25, 40.27 ± 3.95 and\n41.40 ± 3.49 % CO2 to chemical and 82.70 ±7.48, 67.53±5.95 and 58.47 ± 3.83 to mechanical\nstimuli. There was a significant difference between mechanical thresholds (ANOVA,\np<0.001); before was significantly higher than immediately after and 30 minutes\nafter (p=0.047 and p<0.001 respectively). CSQ scores before, immediately after\nSTARE and 30 minutes later were 1.96±1.05, 15.92±2.14 and 5.16±1.26 respectively.The\nincrease in scores was significant immediately after STARE for both visits (repeated\nmeasures ANOVA, p<0.001). Subjects with large changes in mechanical threshold (>40ml/min)\nhad total area of breakup of 7.24% while subjects with minimal changes in threshold\n(<10ml/min) had total area of breakup of 0.86% occurring at more random locations\nwithin the ROI. There appeared to be a moderate correlation between the changes in\nmechanical threshold and area of TBU (r = 0.47, p =0.069)\nConclusion: The results suggest that larger areas of repeated TBU stimulate ocular surface neurons,\nassociated with an increase in symptoms and alterations in sensory thresholds. In\nthis study, STARE trials induced TBU or extensive tear thinning in all subjects with\nmechanical thresholds most affected (19 out of 25 subjects showed increased sensitivity\nto mechanical stimuli). Although exact nature of events within areas of TBU or thinning\nremain speculative, our results suggest stimulation of ocular surface polymodal nociceptors,\nperhaps by local spikes of hyperosmolarity or surface drying within TBU, contributing\nto the changes in mechanical thresholds","title":"Does Repeated Tear Breakup Affect Sensory Thresholds","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180010\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Carolyn Begley, Ping Situ, Trefford Simpson\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University School of Optometry, Indiana University School of Optometry, University of Waterloo School of Optometry & Vision Science\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 304\n                    \n            |#|"}

Laser-treated children had a high incidence of developing\nmyopia or high myopia. Since 2009, intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) has provided another\noption for anti-VEGF treatment of Type I (severe) ROP. There is some evidence that\nrisk for myopia might differ following treatment with IVB compared to laser treatment.\nThis study aims to systematically evaluate risk for myopia following IVB versus laser\ntreatment of Type I ROP.\nMethods: An extensive peer-reviewed literature search was completed using the PubMed search\nengine. Selection criteria were any comparative study that compared the spherical\nequivalent (SEQ) in Type I ROP for IVB versus laser photocoagulation treatments, with\na limit of the mean birthweight less than 1000 grams. Demographic data including numbers\nof eyes treated, gestational ages and birthweights were extracted. Meta-analysis was\nperformed using Review Manager analysis software (RevMan 5.3, The Cochrane Collaboration,\n2014). Means and standard deviations (SD) of SEQ were pooled for all the available\ndata. Standard mean differences (SMD) were calculated with 95% confidence interval\n(CI). A random effect model was used to calculate pooled estimates. Heterogeneity\nbetween the studies was tested using the I\n2\nstatistic, with I\n2\nvalues over 50% indicating significant heterogeneity.\nResults: Eight studies with a total of 284 eyes treated by IVB and 267 eyes treated by laser\nwere finally included. Three of 8 studies implemented subgroup comparisons, 1 of which\ncompared right and left eyes separately, and 2 of which compared respectively in Zone\nI and Zone II ROP classifications. Therefore, 11 pairs of data were eventually pooled.\nIn all 8 studies, the mean gestational ages ranged from 24.3 to 26.6 weeks, and the\nmean birthweights ranged from 622 to 901 grams. The mean SEQ ranged from -3.57 ± 6.19\ndiopters(D) to 1.54 ± 2.19D in IVB treatment and -10.1 ± 10.5D to -2.33 ± 4.11D in\nlaser treatment.

The aim of this study was to evaluate\nthe usefulness of a recently developed fundus alignment program (fundusflicker) for\nautomatically identifying drusen regression and drusen progression.\nMethods: 52 eyes of 38 patients with intermediate AMD met the inclusion criteria and were seen\non at least two different occasions at the Centre for Eye Health, with a mean follow\nup interval of 358 days. Image pairs comprising baseline and follow up fundus photographs\nexported from the native retinal camera software (Capture, Kowa WX3D, Kowa, Japan)\nwere reviewed using the newly developed software.

Contraction of these membranes cause a decreased foveal avascular zone\n(FAZ), flattening of the usual foveal depression, and wrinkling of the retinal surface.\nWhen associated symptoms of metamorphopsia and visual acuity reduction are encountered,\npatients may undergo a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and internal limiting membrane\n(ILM) peel to relieve this contraction. Using multi-modal imaging, this study analyzed\nthe healing process of various retinal structures at the cellular level post PPV and\nILM peel pars plan vitrectomy (PPV) and ILM peel.\n\nMethods:\nThree patients were evaluated using SD-OCT, OCT-A, and an adaptive optics scanning\nlaser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) pre and post PPV and ILM peel. All subjects had initial\npost-op imaging performed within 1 day to 10 days after surgery. The horizontal diameter,\nvertical diameter, and FAZ area were measured using cross sections of the superficial\nvascular plexus (SVP) and deep vascular plexus (DVP) of OCT-A images. Cellular level\nobservations the retina were made using the acquired AOSLO images.\n\nResults: All subjects had a change in location of the FAZ following release of traction.\nSubjects\n1 and 3 (S1 and S3) had a change in FAZ location and FAZ size of both the SVP and\nDVP of >400 Î¼m. In both of these subjects, the centers of the SVP and DVP FAZs\ncorresponded throughout all post-operative exams. S3 had a large change in FAZ location\nbut the slowest change in FAZ size.\nSubject 2 (S2) had a smaller change in FAZ\nlocation. Unlike S1 and S3, the SVP and DVP FAZ area decreased at the one day post-op\nimaging session but increased at subsequent sessions. S2 also had a difference between\nthe centers of the SVP and DVP FAZs of 62 Î¼m.\nIn the infrared SLO images of all\nsubjects, swelling of the arcuate nerve fiber layer (SANFL) is visualized. In some\ncorresponding locations that were imaged via AOSLO, presumed apoptotic ganglion cells\nwere visualized.\nConclusion: In all 3 study participants there is a close correspondence in the center locations\nof the FAZs of the SVP and DVP which indicates that the vascular layers move together\nin response to the surface forces of the ERM. The FAZ increases in size as tension\non the retina is released. SANFL is visible in all patients and apoptotic ganglion\ncells are commonly seen. Continued high-resolution imaging can provide insight to\npatient outcomes post PPV and ILM peel.","title":"Multimodal Imaging of Early Retinal Structure Changes Post Internal Limiting  Membrane Peelbr","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180003\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Indiana University, School of Optometry\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Brett King, Stephen Burns, Kaitlyn Sapoznik, Frank Hrisomalos, F.

DR progresses from nonproliferative DR (NPDR)\nto proliferative DR (PDR), with severe NPDR and PDR having the highest risk of severe\nvision loss. Diabetic macular edema (DME), which also impairs vision, occurs in both\nNPDR and PDR. In general, pts with mild-moderate NPDR are considered to have non-vision-threatening\nDR (NVTDR) while pts with severe NPDR and PDR have vision-threatening DR (VTDR). While\nDR progression has been examined in the context of clinical trials, an understanding\nof what happens to untreated patients with DR in a real-world setting has been lacking.\nUsing a large US claims database, the purpose of this study was to examine over 5\nyears (y): 1) distribution of disease severity stage of newly diagnosed DR; 2) DR\nworsening from NVTDR to VTDR; 3) risk of progression to DME; 4) median days to DR\nworsening; and 5) baseline (BL) characteristics of pts whose DR worsened vs pts whose\nDR did not.\nMethods: This longitudinal cohort study of US claims included all pts aged ? 18 y with newly\ndiagnosed DR as defined by ICD-9 diagnosis codes with 5 y of follow-up, ? 2 outpatient\nclaims of initial DR diagnosis between 7/1/2007 and 4/30/2012 (to allow 5-y follow-up),\nno diagnosis of DR, DME, or other retinal diseases in the prior 18 months, and no\ntreatment for DR prior to or during follow-up. BL demographic and clinical characteristics,\nincluding age, sex, health plan type, geography, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI),\nand Diabetes Complication Severity Index, were measured. Median time to worsening\nDR was calculated; DR worsening defined as a change from NVTDR to VTDR status.\nResults: At BL, 8639 of 14,490 (59.6%) pts were classified with NVTDR, including mild (47.5%,\nn = 6878) or moderate (12.2%, n = 1761) NPDR; and 5851 (40.4%) with VTDR (excluding\nDME), including severe NPDR (3.0%, n = 439) or PDR (37.3%, n = 5412) at BL. Over a\n5-y period, of pts starting with NVTDR, 2250 (26.0%) worsened to VTDR (median time\n757 days), 532 (6.2%) pts' DR stage worsened (median time 863 days), 1926 (22.3%)\ndeveloped DME (median time 776 days), and 208 (2.4%) pts had both worsened DR and\ndeveloped DME. Pts who developed DME or DR worsening had more comorbidities at BL\n(ECI 1.67 vs 1.55, P = 0.007). Over a 5-y period, a greater proportion of pts\nstarting with VTDR developed DME (33.4% [n = 1957]) compared with pts with NVTDR (22.3%\n[n = 1926]) (p < 0.001).\nConclusion: In a large observational analysis of US claims data from 8639 pts with newly diagnosed\nDR, over a 5-y period, ~ 25% of pts progressed to VTDR or developed DME (26.0% and\n22.3%, respectively). Progression occurred within a median time of ~ 2 y, suggesting\nthat pts should be closely monitored and intervention may be warranted.","title":"Diabetic Retinopathy DR Progression in a RealWorld Setting 5year Progression  of Newly Diagnosed Untreated DR from a Large US Claims Database","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180005\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Genentech, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Andrew Moshfeghi, Ibrahim Abbas, Daniel Sheinson, Vincent Garmo\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        USC Roski Eye Institute, Genentech, Inc., Genentech, Inc., Genentech, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}

The mean number of DEX injections\nwas 2.07 (0.11 SE; range 1-7). The mean age of the patients was 67 years (SD 10; range\n38-92), 50% were female and 79% were white. OCT data for central macular thickness\nwere analyzed for a third of the eyes (additional OCT are available and will be presented).\nMultilevel modeling accounted for correlations between eyes during regression analyses.\nResults: Across all eyes, VA improved by ?0.1 log units after 1-6 weeks for 44% of the DEX\ninserts (i.e., 55% of RVO eyes and 38% of DR eyes) and by >0.2 log units after\n27% of DEX inserts (i.e., 36% of RVO eyes and 22% of DR eyes). Across all eyes, there\nwas no significant change in VA when comparing the 1-6 week time period to 2-3 months\npost-treatment (mean difference 0.002 log units; p=0.88). After 1-6 weeks post-treatment,\nthere was a significant difference in mean VA improvement when comparing eyes with\nDR (0.043 log units) to eyes with RVO (0.12 log units)(p=0.02). Eyes with DR had significantly\nbetter pre-treatment VA by 0.19 log units than eyes with RVO (p=0.005), thus DR eyes\nhad a greater potential for ceiling effects, and diagnosis was no longer a significant\nfactor when accounting for pre-treatment VA as a significant predictor (p<0.001)\nof post-treatment VA change in a multivariate model. Mean reduction in OCT central\nthickness was 130 Î¼m (range +38 to -578) at 1-6 weeks post-treatment across all eyes\nwith OCT results.

To understand\nearly treatment response to RBZ, we assessed Months 3 and 6 in a pooled analysis of\nthe RIDE/RISE study population to investigate the relationship between early response\nand baseline DR severity.\nMethods: In this pooled retrospective analysis of DR patients with DME from RIDE/RISE, we examined\nbaseline predictors of ?2- and ?3-step DR improvement, at months 3 and 6, in the pooled\nRBZ treatment arms (0.3 mg/0.5 mg) using univariate and multivariate analyses. The\nanalysis population was limited to RBZ-treated patients with baseline Early Treatment\nDiabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) DR Severity Scale (DRSS) ?35 for ? 2-step improvement\nand ?43 for ? 3-step improvement who had room to improve by 2- or 3-steps on the ETDRS-DRSS.\nResults: At month 3 and month 6, 20.1% (79/394) and 31.2% (116/372), respectively, of RBZ-treated\npatients, had achieved a ? 2-step improvement in DR severity. In the univariate analyses,\nbaseline (BL) DRSS of 47/53 (moderately severe/severe non-proliferative DR [NPDR])\nwas associated with ?2-step DR severity improvement at both months 3 and 6 (P <\n0.0001), with the majority of RBZ-treated patients who experienced a ? 2-step DR severity\nimprovement at month 3 (68.4%) and month 6 (78.4%) having 47/53 BL DRSS. The majority\nof patients with ?2-step DR improvement at month 6 had no DME at month 3 (61.9%; P\n= 0.002). At months 3 and 6, 10/12 (83.3%) and 12/18 (66.7%) patients, respectively,\nachieved ?3-step DR improvement. Interestingly, a majority of those who improved by\n?3 steps had proliferative DR (PDR; DRSS 60-75) at baseline (p < 0.05).\nConclusion: These observations suggest that there is evidence to support a potential paradigm\nshift towards early referral/treatment to prevent progression to vision threatening\nDR, and furthermore, resolution of DME may not preclude subsequent improvements in\nDR with RBZ treatment. The numerical evidence of early ? 3-step improvements at months\n3 and 6, mostly in patients with PDR, shows that RBZ can benefit some patients with\nadvanced proliferative disease. These data may inform and optimize best practices\non when to refer patients with DR, with or without DME. Further studies on what predictive\nfactors may govern the early response to treatment are also warranted.","title":"Predictors of Early Improvements in Diabetic Retinopathy DR Severity at Month 3  and Month 6 in Patients Receiving Ranibizumab Treatment","details":"\n                Year:\n              \n                  2018\n                \n            |#|\n                Program Number:\n                \n                        180007\n                    \n            |#|\n              Resource Type:\n              \n                  Scientific Program\n                \n            |#|\n                Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Grin Eye Care\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Authors:\n                \n                        Lauren Hill, Mila Malhotra, Avanti Ghanekar\n                    \n            |#|\n                Co-Author Affiliation:\n                \n                        Genentech, Inc., Genentech, Inc., Genentech, Inc.\n                    \n            |#|\n                Room:\n                \n                        Room 303\n                    \n            |#|"}
